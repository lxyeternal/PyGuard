{
  "purpose": "This code defines and registers a custom colormap ('sauron' and 'sauron_r') in Matplotlib, then demonstrates their usage by displaying images with these colormaps.",
  "sources": "Reading the Matplotlib colormaps to check if 'sauron' exists; reading the colormap data within 'register_sauron_colormap' function; generating test image data in the main block.",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib's colormap registration functions which modify global state; plotting functions displaying images with the custom colormaps.",
  "flows": "Source: Checking existing colormaps and registering new colormaps -> Sinks: Visualization using 'imshow' with custom colormaps.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded colormap data is used; no external inputs, no suspicious dynamic code execution or network activity; the code appears purely for visualization purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'register_sauron_colormap' that creates and registers a custom colormap 'sauron' and its reversed version 'sauron_r' using fixed color control points. It checks if the colormap already exists before registering to avoid duplication. The main block generates sample image data and displays two images with these colormaps. There are no indications of malicious behavior, external data handling, or hidden code; the code is straightforward and primarily for visualization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate visualization utility that registers and demonstrates custom colormaps in Matplotlib. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. It solely manipulates visualization settings with hardcoded data, with no external inputs or security concerns.",
