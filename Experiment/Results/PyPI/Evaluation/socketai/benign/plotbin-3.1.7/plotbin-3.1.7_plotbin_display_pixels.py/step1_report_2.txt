{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to visualize pixel data on a regular grid with optional rotation and color mapping.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from provided x, y, val arrays; uses matplotlib for plotting; imports colormap registration from external module.",
  "sinks": "Outputs images via matplotlib, potentially with colorbars, but no data transmission or external data storage.",
  "flows": "Input data (x, y, val) -> processes and visualizes via matplotlib functions -> displays or saves plot.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual data flows observed. The code imports external colormap registration, which appears benign. No obfuscated code features or suspicious dynamic execution found.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary plotting libraries and a custom colormap. It defines a function for rendering pixel data with optional rotation and color mapping, including input validation and grid checks. The logic for pixel size estimation and image rendering is straightforward. No external data transmission, system commands, or hidden behaviors are present. The usage example at the bottom demonstrates visualization without any malicious actions. Overall, the code is a standard visualization utility with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization tool intended for plotting pixel data with optional rotation and coloring. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
