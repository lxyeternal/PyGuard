{
  "purpose": "The code provides a function to display pixel data on a 2D plot with optional rotation and color mapping, mainly for visualizing images or pixel grids.",
  "sources": "Reads input arrays x, y, val; reads kwargs for plotting options; imports external libraries and colormap registration function.",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib for plotting; does not include code that writes to files, network, or external storage; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (x, y, val) flows into plotting functions; optional rotation modifies coordinate data before plotting; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. Colormap registration is standard; no obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports common plotting libraries, defines a function for visualizing pixel data with rotation and color mapping, and includes a usage example. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malware. The code's primary purpose is visualization; it does not perform network operations, write to system files, or access sensitive data. No anomalies like hardcoded credentials, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data visualization utility designed for plotting pixel-based images with optional rotation and color mapping. It contains no malware, malicious intent, or security risks based on the provided content.",
