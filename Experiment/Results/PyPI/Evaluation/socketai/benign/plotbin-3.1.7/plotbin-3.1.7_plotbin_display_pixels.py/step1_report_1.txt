{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to visualize pixel data on a grid, with options for rotation and color mapping, primarily for scientific or image analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the input arrays x, y, and val provided to the display_pixels function, which are expected to contain coordinate and value data for plotting.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of plt.imshow() and plt.pcolormesh(), which render images or plots; however, these are standard plotting functions. No data is sent over network, stored insecurely, or used in malicious ways.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays (x, y, val) into the function, where coordinates are transformed and used for plotting; no external or untrusted data is fetched or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, network connections, or obfuscated code, is present. The only notable aspect is the use of a custom colormap registration, which is benign and related to visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for plotting and numerical operations. The function display_pixels processes input coordinate and value arrays, checks for consistent sizes, determines pixel size, and constructs an image for display. It performs coordinate transformations, grid checks, and plotting with optional rotation. All operations are typical for visualization routines. No data leakage, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a well-structured visualization utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a visualization utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard plotting tasks with no network or data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. It is safe to use.",
