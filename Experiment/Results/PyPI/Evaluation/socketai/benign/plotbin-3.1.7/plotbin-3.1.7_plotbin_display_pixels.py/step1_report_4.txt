{
  "purpose": "The code provides a function for visualizing pixel data with optional rotation and color mapping, primarily for plotting large datasets efficiently.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters x, y, and val, which are numpy arrays provided by the user; no external data sources or untrusted input streams are used within the code.",
  "sinks": "The code generates visual output via matplotlib plotting functions, which are intended for display or file output; no data leaks or external network communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Input data (x, y, val) flows into processing steps where pixel size is determined and an image array is constructed; this data is then visualized using matplotlib's imshow or pcolormesh functions for rendering, with optional rotation applied.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard and consistent with typical plotting routines. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, backdoors, or unusual behavior is present. It imports a custom colormap registration but does not execute code that communicates externally or executes malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard visualization libraries and defines a plotting function that takes coordinate and value data, processes it into an image format, and visualizes it with optional rotation and color mapping. The function includes assertions for data consistency, checks for regular grid structure, and handles large datasets by requesting user input for pixel size. The use of the 'register_sauron_colormap' is benign, as it simply registers a custom colormap. The code includes an example usage within a main guard that demonstrates visualization. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or code injection. The logic is straightforward and aligned with typical plotting routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard visualization utility for displaying pixel data with optional rotation and coloring. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The only potential concern could be the optional use of external colormap registration, which is benign and explicitly documented. Overall, the code appears safe and solely focused on plotting.",
