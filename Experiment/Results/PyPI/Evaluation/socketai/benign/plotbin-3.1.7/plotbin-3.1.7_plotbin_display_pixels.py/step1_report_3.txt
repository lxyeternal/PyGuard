{
  "purpose": "The code provides a visualization utility to display pixel data on a grid with optional rotation and color mapping, primarily for plotting purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters (x, y, val), which are user-provided arrays, and imports external libraries like numpy, matplotlib, and a custom colormap registration.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the matplotlib plotting functions (imshow, pcolormesh, colorbar) which generate visual outputs. No untrusted data is sent elsewhere or over the network.",
  "flows": "Input arrays (x, y, val) are processed, potentially rotated, and visualized via matplotlib plotting functions. Data flows from input parameters through computations to visualization outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are detected. The code performs standard plotting operations. The custom colormap registration might be inspected, but it is a benign, domain-specific extension.",
  "analysis": "The script is a visualization tool for displaying pixel data with optional rotation and color mapping. It includes input validation, data normalization, grid checks, and plotting routines. It uses well-known scientific Python libraries with no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious actions. The custom colormap registration is likely domain-specific and does not contain malicious code. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code are present. All data flows are confined to visualization and no external communication occurs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate visualization utility for scientific data plotting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It is safe to use, provided that the external 'register_sauron_colormap' function is also benign.",
