{
  "purpose": "The code visualizes Voronoi binning results by displaying a map using original pixel coordinates and Voronoi generator points, with an option to annotate with velocity data.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from x, y, velBin, xBin, yBin; retrieves display_pixels function from plotbin.display_pixels module.",
  "sinks": "Uses display_pixels to generate and display an image, which may output graphics or image data; no other external sinks or data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Reads coordinate data (x, y, xBin, yBin), computes bin numbers via nearest neighbor search, then passes data to display_pixels for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; use of assertions, warnings, and a conditional for memory optimization is standard; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a Voronoi tessellation based on generator points and original pixel coordinates, with a fallback to a loop-based method for large datasets to conserve memory. It warns users about using a different routine and asserts data consistency. The primary function relies on a standard nearest neighbor calculation and calls an external display function to visualize data. There are no indications of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears well-structured and purposeful, with safeguards and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for visualization of Voronoi binning results in astronomical or spatial data analysis. No malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident. It simply processes input data and visualizes results using a standard plotting function.",
