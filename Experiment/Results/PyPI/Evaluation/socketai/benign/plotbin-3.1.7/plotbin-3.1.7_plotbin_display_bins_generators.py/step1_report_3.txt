{
  "purpose": "The code visualizes Voronoi binning maps by assigning pixel coordinates to generator bins and displaying the result.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters x, y, velBin, and optional kwargs; imports warnings, numpy, and display_pixels function.",
  "sinks": "Uses display_pixels to generate and display an image based on processed bin data.",
  "flows": "Input coordinates (x, y, velBin) are compared with generator coordinates (xBin, yBin) to assign bin numbers; bin data flows into display_pixels for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors observed. No unusual data handling or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs Voronoi bin assignment using Euclidean distance calculations, switching to a memory-efficient loop for large datasets. It relies on an external display_pixels function for visualization. The code includes assertions to validate input data sizes, and issues a warning suggesting alternative routines. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The only notable aspect is the warning about preferred usage, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard visualization routine for Voronoi binning, with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It performs expected operations securely and transparently.",
