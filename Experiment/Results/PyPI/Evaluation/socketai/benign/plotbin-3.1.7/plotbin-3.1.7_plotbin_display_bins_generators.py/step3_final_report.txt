  "purpose": "Visualize Voronoi binning results using pixel and generator coordinates, aiding in spatial data analysis.",
  "sources": "x, y, xBin, yBin, velBin, optional angle, and kwargs, primarily reading coordinate arrays and bin data.",
  "sinks": "External function display_pixels, which generates visualization; no data leaks or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Assigns bin numbers via nearest neighbor search (vectorized or loop), then passes data to display_pixels for rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected; standard assertions and warnings used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation, memory-efficient bin assignment, and visualization. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present. External dependencies are assumed benign. The logic is straightforward and aligns with standard practices for large data handling and visualization routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured visualization utility for Voronoi binning data. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1), consistent with the analysis.",
