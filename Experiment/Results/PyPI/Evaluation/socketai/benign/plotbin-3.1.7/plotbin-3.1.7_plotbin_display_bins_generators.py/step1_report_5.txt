{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to visualize Voronoi binned maps based on input pixel coordinates and bin generator coordinates, using display functions to generate visual output.",
  "sources": "Input parameters xBin, yBin, velBin, x, y, angle, and any additional keyword arguments (**kwargs); data read from these inputs.",
  "sinks": "The display_pixels function potentially generates visual output; no explicit sinks like network, file write, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input coordinate arrays flow into np.argmin computations to assign bin numbers, then into display_pixels to produce output visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. Use of large array processing with memory considerations is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation with assertions, then applies a Voronoi binning logic either via numpy broadcasting for small datasets or a loop for larger datasets to reduce memory usage. The display_pixels function is called for visualization. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious data handling is detected. All operations are consistent with typical data visualization routines and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate visualization utility for Voronoi binning maps. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It processes data inputs securely without evident security risks.",
