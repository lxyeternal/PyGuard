{
  "purpose": "The code visualizes Voronoi binning maps by displaying pixels based on their generator coordinates and velocities, primarily used for astronomical data visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads input arrays x, y, velBin, xBin, yBin, and optional angle; imports display_pixels from an external module.",
  "sinks": "Uses display_pixels function which may process and display data; no direct data leaks or network activity visible.",
  "flows": "Inputs (x, y, velBin, xBin, yBin, angle) -> Computes bin assignments -> Calls display_pixels with selected velocities -> Displays output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; uses warnings.warn to suggest alternative functions, which is benign; memory optimization for large arrays is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data validation on input array sizes, then assigns bin numbers based on proximity either via vectorized approach or looping for memory efficiency. It calls an external display function for visualization. No code injection, network activity, or suspicious behavior detected. The use of warnings and assertions are standard for input validation. The routine relies on external library 'display_pixels' which is assumed benign. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard visualization utility for astronomical data, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs data handling, validation, and visualization in a typical manner.",
