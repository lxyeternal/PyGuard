{
  "purpose": "To visualize Voronoi binning results by displaying a pixel map based on generator and pixel coordinates.",
  "sources": "Reads input data: x, y, xBin, yBin, velBin, and optional angle; uses display_pixels function which may process untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "Calls display_pixels with processed data, which may involve rendering or data handling; no explicit data sinks like network or file output detected.",
  "flows": "x and y coordinate data flows into the Voronoi bin assignment logic; binNum indices derived from coordinate comparisons flow into display_pixels function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Uses a simple for loop for memory management; no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation and asserts data consistency for coordinate arrays. It computes bin assignments either via NumPy vectorized operations or a for loop for large datasets, aiming to reduce memory usage. It then calls a display function with the binned velocity data. No external data transmission, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a visualization utility with standard functions and safeguards. There are warnings for better practices but no malicious intent or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard visualization utility for Voronoi binning, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain attacks. It properly handles large data efficiently and performs necessary assertions to prevent data mismatches. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks identified.",
