  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not output or process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; simple assignment of a static string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line assigning a string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no inputs, outputs, external data sources, or executable logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or anomalies are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, with full confidence, which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign intent of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version string assignment with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
