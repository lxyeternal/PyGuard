  "analysis": "The code solely assigns a version string to the variable '__version__'. This is a common practice in Python packages to specify the version of the package/module. There are no data inputs, no suspicious code constructs, or potentially malicious patterns. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version assignment, typical for Python packages. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
