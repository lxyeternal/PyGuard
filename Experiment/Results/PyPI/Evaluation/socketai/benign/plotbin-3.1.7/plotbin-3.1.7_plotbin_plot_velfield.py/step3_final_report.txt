{
  "purpose": "Visualization of velocity fields with optional flux overlays and colorbars, using matplotlib for scientific plotting.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters (x, y, vel, flux); data generation in example uses numpy's random number generator.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or system modifications; outputs plots and colorbars locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through plotting functions to visualization outputs; no external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; external colormap registration is benign; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard scientific visualization utility employing numpy and matplotlib. It generates synthetic data with numpy's secure default_rng(), performs local plotting with contourf and tricontour, and optionally adds a colorbar. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. External dependency on 'plotbin.sauron_colormap' is assumed to be benign. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0-0.1) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe scientific visualization script with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. External dependencies appear trustworthy. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate and justified.",
