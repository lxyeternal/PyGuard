{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to visualize velocity fields in astronomy data using matplotlib, with features like contour plotting, colormap registration, and optional flux overlay.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters (x, y, vel, flux), which are typically numpy arrays supplied by the user or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Output includes plotting to the current matplotlib axes and optional display of colorbars and contours; no untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters into numpy operations, then into matplotlib plotting functions, with no evidence of untrusted data being sent over network or written to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual system calls. Use of 'register_sauron_colormap' is justified and local, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports common scientific libraries (numpy, matplotlib) and a custom colormap registration module. The main function 'plot_velfield' processes input data, normalizes levels, and creates contour plots with optional flux overlay and colorbar. It handles data normalization, plotting parameters, and colorbar ticks with care. The usage example generates synthetic data for testing, with no malicious code or side effects. The code appears well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a visualization tool for astronomical velocity fields, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard plotting operations without external network activity, hidden backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms.",
