  "purpose": "The code defines a function to visualize velocity fields with optional flux overlay, including color mapping and plotting features. It also includes a usage example that generates synthetic data and plots it.",
  "sources": "Input data includes parameters x, y, vel, flux, and optional keyword arguments. The data is read from function arguments and generated within the example usage.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include matplotlib plotting functions that display data and generate visual output. No data is sent over networks or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments and generated variables into plotting functions (tricontourf, plot, colorbar). The data is visualized locally without external data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. Use of np.random.default_rng is current, and the code employs standard matplotlib functions. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a visualization tool for velocity fields, with options for colormap customization, contour overlays, and colorbar configuration. It imports standard libraries and a custom colormap registration function. The plotting functions use typical matplotlib procedures, with no code injection or external data transmission. The example generates synthetic data securely with numpy's random generator. No suspicious or malicious constructs, hidden behaviors, or malicious network activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign visualization utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies solely on standard scientific Python libraries and functions. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no indications of malware or malicious behavior.",
