{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for visualizing velocity fields and example usage with generated data, mainly for scientific plotting and analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters (x, y, vel, flux) and internally generated random data (np.random.default_rng).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially flow into plotting functions; however, the code primarily visualizes data and does not include network communication or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input data (x, y, vel, flux) flow into plotting functions, which generate visualizations. No external data or command execution flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Use of standard libraries and plotting routines is typical for scientific scripts. No obfuscation or hidden code features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common scientific Python libraries and defines a plotting function for velocity fields, with customization options. It registers a custom colormap and includes an example script generating synthetic data with numpy's random generator. No network operations, credential handling, or system modifications are present. The code follows standard practices and includes no suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard scientific plotting utility with no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate data visualization tool for velocity field analysis. No malicious or security-threatening code was identified.",
