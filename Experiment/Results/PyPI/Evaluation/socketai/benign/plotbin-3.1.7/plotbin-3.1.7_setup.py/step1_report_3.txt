{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the Python project 'plotbin'.",
  "sources": "Reads the __init__.py file for version information; reads README.rst for long description; imports setuptools for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from the package's __init__.py, then uses that info in setup configuration; reads README for description.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a direct open() call without context management when reading files, which is not a security issue but a coding best practice note; no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: importing necessary modules, defining a function to extract the package version from __init__.py using regex, and calling setup() with package metadata. The version extraction method reads the file directly and applies regex to find the version string. No data is fetched from untrusted sources or executed dynamically. No malware or obfuscation present. No suspicious behaviors or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only reads files and configures package installation, following standard practices.",
