  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It notes the use of regex for version extraction and no external data flows.\n- **Verification:** The code indeed reads `__init__.py` and extracts `__version__` via regex, then passes data to `setup()`. No external inputs or untrusted data are involved.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both are zero, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 is appropriate. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard setup pattern with no suspicious activity.\n- **Verification:** The code reads files and passes data to `setup()`. No dynamic code execution or external data.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both zero.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 is appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a standard setup script. Uses regex without error handling but that's common.\n- **Verification:** The code reads files, extracts version, and calls `setup()`. No malicious logic.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both zero.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 is suitable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—standard setup script, no malicious activity.\n- **Verification:** Reads files, extracts version, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both zero.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still concludes no malicious behavior.\n- **Verification:** Same as others, straightforward setup script.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both zero.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Are the issues present?** No. All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** The malware score should be 0, obfuscated 0, and overall security risk 0, which all reports agree upon.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** None. The code does not perform any dynamic or external operations that could be exploited.\n- **Consistency:** All reports are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward, standard Python package setup script with no security concerns.",
