  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is a standard setup script with no malicious activity, no external data flows, and no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues found; scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard setup pattern, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; scores align.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; standard setup script, no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns; scores are consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates the typical pattern, with no suspicious activity. Notes that regex may fail if pattern isn't found but that’s standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Also describes a standard setup script, with no malicious or obfuscated code. Slightly lower confidence (0.9) but still consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; scores align.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; all reports confirm straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** All zero, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Malware score justification:** Since no malicious activity, malware=0 is justified.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only minor point is the regex extraction without error handling, but this is standard and not malicious.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the reports.\n- No changes needed.\n- The code is a typical, safe setup script with no security risks.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, straightforward, and follows standard practices. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
