  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It correctly identifies that the code reads static files and uses regex to extract version info.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent with the analysis.  \n- **Justification:** No issues detected; the code is straightforward.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it confirms the code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Note:** No anomalies or vulnerabilities noted.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the report finds no malicious behavior, only standard setup operations.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.  \n- **Observation:** Uses open() without context manager, but this is not a security concern here.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: standard setup script, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.  \n- **Additional note:** The regex could fail if pattern changes, but this is typical.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Also concludes no malicious behavior or security risks.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — reasonable.  \n- **Note:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still aligns with the overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code does not contain any malicious or suspicious patterns (e.g., dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscated code).  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports; the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**Are any scores unreasonable?**  \nNo. The code is a standard setup script, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The regex for version extraction, while minimal, is a common pattern and does not introduce security concerns.\n\n**Potential improvements:**  \n- The code could use a context manager for file handling to improve best practices, but this does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the reports and my review, I concur with the given scores.**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Overall, the package appears secure, with no malicious or obfuscated code present.**",
