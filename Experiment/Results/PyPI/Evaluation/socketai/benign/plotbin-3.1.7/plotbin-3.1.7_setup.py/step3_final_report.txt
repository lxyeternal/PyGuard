  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'plotbin' module, extracting version info from __init__.py, and defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'plotbin/__init__.py' via regex, reads 'README.rst' for long description, static files for metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or dynamic code execution; static file reads only.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from file -> passes data to setup() without external data flow or user input.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() without context manager; regex may fail if pattern not found, leading to potential AttributeError, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious or obfuscated code. The regex extraction lacks error handling, which could cause runtime errors if pattern missing, but this is a coding robustness issue, not security. No network activity, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns detected. All reports correctly identify the code as benign with malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. Minor improvements could include adding error handling for regex, but this does not impact security. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
