  "purpose": "Importing specific classes and functions from the pythena package, likely for database or data analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from pythena.Athena and pythena.Utils modules, which may involve reading or executing code within those modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or output in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with only import statements; no source-to-sink paths evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements; no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "This snippet consists solely of import statements from a third-party library 'pythena'. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The imports themselves are standard Python practice and do not imply malicious intent. Since no additional code or data manipulation is present, there are no apparent security risks or malicious behaviors within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements without any malicious activity or security concerns identified.",
