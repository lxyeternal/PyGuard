  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, scores, and any potential issues.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as simply defining custom exception classes inheriting from Exception.\n- No input/output, data flow, external dependencies, or logic are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are identified.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n1. **Code Content vs. Reports:**\n   - The code indeed only defines multiple custom exception classes with no additional logic.\n   - The reports accurately describe the code as such, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n\n2. **Error in the Reports:**\n   - No errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning. The reports correctly identify the nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n4. **Malware and Security Risks:**\n   - No malware or malicious activity is present.\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as error handling constructs.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (No malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (Code is straightforward, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (No security risks identified; exception class definitions are standard and safe)\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions with no security or malicious concerns. The scores are justified and consistent.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nApprove the current scores and conclusions.",
