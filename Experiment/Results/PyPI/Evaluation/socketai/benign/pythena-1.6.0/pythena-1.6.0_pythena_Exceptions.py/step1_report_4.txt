  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various query and S3-related errors in a larger application.",
  "sources": "N/A (no input or data reading beyond class declarations)",
  "sinks": "N/A (no untrusted data handling or external data output)",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow or data processing occurs in this code snippet)",
  "anomalies": "All classes are simple exception definitions with no additional logic, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class declarations inheriting from Python's Exception base class. No code execution, data handling, or external communication is present. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or security risks are evident. The classes are straightforward and serve as custom error types. There are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
