  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and assess the accuracy of their conclusions, the appropriateness of the scores, and whether any issues are present.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as solely defining custom exception classes inheriting from Exception.\n- No external data, input/output, or logic is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are detected.\n- The analysis in all reports is consistent and accurate.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose:** Accurate—defines custom exceptions for query, S3, and database errors.  \n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct—no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=1.  \n- **Verdict:** Fully justified. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose:** Correct—custom exceptions for query and S3 errors.  \n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct—no malicious activity or vulnerabilities.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, confidence=1.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Same as above—consistent and accurate.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, confidence=1.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Same consistent findings.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, confidence=1.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same consistent analysis.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, confidence=1.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, as there's no malicious activity or payload.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, since the code is straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk score:** 0, given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- The reports are thorough and accurate; no adjustments are necessary.\n- The code appears to be a standard, benign pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks. The reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores.\n\n**Final note:**  \nEnsure that in larger contexts, these exception classes are used appropriately and that no dynamic code execution or external data handling occurs elsewhere, but based solely on this snippet, there are no concerns.",
