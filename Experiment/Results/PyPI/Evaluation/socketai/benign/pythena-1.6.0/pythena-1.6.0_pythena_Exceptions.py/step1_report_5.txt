  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error scenarios related to database and query operations.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources; exception classes are defined without data input handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output operations are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as there are no executable or data-processing components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with no additional logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or hidden behaviors. The structure and content are typical for defining custom error types in Python. No suspicious imports, data leaks, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of custom exception class definitions for handling specific error cases. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a standard practice for error management in larger codebases.",
