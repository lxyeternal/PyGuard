  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of straightforward custom exception class definitions.\n- No external data, input/output, or logic is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The analysis across all reports consistently concludes that the code is benign, standard, and poses no security risks.\n\n**Confirming the code's content:**\n- The original code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Exception.\n- There are no additional methods, logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n- The code appears to be purely for error handling in a larger application.\n\n**Assessment of the reports:**\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- They assign a confidence level of 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity.\n- Malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with straightforward class definitions.\n- Security risk score is 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n**Evaluation of scores:**\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and justified.\n- No report suggests any reason to alter the scores.\n- The logical reasoning is sound, emphasizing the lack of anomalies or malicious intent.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely class definitions with no malicious intent.\n- No assumptions about hidden behaviors or obfuscated code are necessary, as the code is transparent.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The current scoring and analysis are appropriate.\n- Given the evidence, I agree with the assessments that this code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code segment is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions. It does not pose any security threats or malicious risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
