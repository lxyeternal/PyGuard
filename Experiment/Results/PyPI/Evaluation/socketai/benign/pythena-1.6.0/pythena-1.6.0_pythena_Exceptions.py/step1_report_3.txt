  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error conditions related to query execution and AWS S3 path handling.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines exception classes without reading input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; the code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's base Exception class. There are no data inputs, external communications, or dynamic code execution. No potential attack vectors or malicious behaviors are present. The structure is straightforward, and no anomalies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining exception types with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard practice for error handling in larger applications.",
