  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error scenarios related to query execution, S3 paths, and database operations.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs, no data reading or input handling present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No output, data leaks, or external communication present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input/output flow, or untrusted data flow present in the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code solely defines custom exception classes with no logic or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple class definitions inheriting from Exception, serving as custom error types. These classes are straightforward, without any additional logic, data manipulation, or external calls. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The structure appears to be standard for Python exception handling in larger applications.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical pattern for error handling and does not contain any malware, suspicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.",
