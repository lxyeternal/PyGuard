{
  "purpose": "Defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Exception for error handling purposes.",
  "sources": "The class definitions themselves; no external data or input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external interactions; the code only declares exception classes.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input/output, or external data processing within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations for custom exceptions, with no logic, data handling, or external dependencies. All reports correctly identify the benign and standard nature of this code. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports' assessments are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
