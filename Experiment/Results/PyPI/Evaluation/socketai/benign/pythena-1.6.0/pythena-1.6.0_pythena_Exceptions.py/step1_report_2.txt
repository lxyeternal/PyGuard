  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various query and S3 path errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; purely class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths since no input or output operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; only standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Exception, with no embedded logic, input handling, or external dependencies. It appears to be straightforward error class declarations used for error handling in a larger application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code injections. The code structure and naming are clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple set of custom exception classes intended for error handling in query and S3 path operations. There are no indications of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks present in this code fragment.",
