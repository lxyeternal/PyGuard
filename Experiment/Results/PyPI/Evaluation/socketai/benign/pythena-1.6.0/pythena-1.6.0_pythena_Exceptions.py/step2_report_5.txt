  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`.\n- No external data, input/output, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears straightforward, standard for error handling.\n\n**Assessment of each report:**\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All conclude that the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The confidence score is 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- The malware score is 0 in all cases, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The reports do not challenge the possibility that, in a different context, such exception classes could be misused or could be part of a larger malicious scheme. However, based solely on this code snippet, such concerns are unwarranted.\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n- The code is a straightforward, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No changes to scores are necessary based on the provided information.\n- The risk and malware scores should remain at 0, and confidence at 1.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious patterns)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the nature of the code.\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the broader context in real scenarios, but based solely on this snippet, the code is safe.",
