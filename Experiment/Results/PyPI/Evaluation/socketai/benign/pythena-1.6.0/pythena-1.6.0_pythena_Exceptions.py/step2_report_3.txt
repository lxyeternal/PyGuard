  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and assess their findings, scores, and any potential inconsistencies.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as simple class definitions for custom exceptions, with no logic, input/output, or external interactions.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating certainty that the code is benign.\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n- Security risk scores are 0, which is reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or anomalies:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes without logic or external dependencies.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected or claimed.\n\n2. **Scores justification:**\n   - The malware scores are 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - The security risk scores are 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the straightforward code.\n\n3. **Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n   - No issues found. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The reasoning is sound: exception class definitions are standard and pose no security threat.\n\n4. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly state that the code is benign.\n   - No unwarranted security concerns are present.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is purely defining custom exception classes with no malicious or suspicious content.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n- The detailed reasoning supports that these classes are standard error handling constructs with no security implications.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Confirmed that the code contains only class definitions for exceptions.\n- No errors, flaws, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- Scores are justified and consistent.\n- Final recommendation: maintain the current scores; no adjustments needed.",
