{
  "purpose": "A utility script to list AWS Glue databases using boto3, handling pagination and printing sorted database names.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from AWS Glue via boto3 client, specifically calling get_databases and iterating over the DatabaseList.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs database names to the console using print statements; no untrusted data is processed or stored elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The script retrieves database data from AWS Glue (source), processes it in memory, and outputs to stdout (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured utility for listing AWS Glue databases. It uses standard boto3 SDK calls with proper pagination handling. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code outputs data directly to the console, which is benign. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior and environment reliance. The code's purpose is resource enumeration, and it does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal security risk score reflects reliance on environment configuration rather than inherent vulnerabilities.",
