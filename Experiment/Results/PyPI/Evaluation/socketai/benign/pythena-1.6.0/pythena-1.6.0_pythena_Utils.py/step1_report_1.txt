{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to connect to AWS Glue service, retrieve the list of database names, and print them sorted.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from function parameters and AWS credentials via boto3's default session management.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data to the console via print statements.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (region, session) are used to create AWS session -> call get_databases -> collect database names -> print_databases calls print_list -> prints sorted list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious behaviors detected. The code interacts solely with AWS SDK to retrieve and display database info. No suspicious code, backdoors, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script uses boto3 to establish a session with AWS and retrieves Glue database names through the get_databases function, which handles pagination via NextToken. It then prints the sorted list of database names. The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscated code, hidden payloads, or malicious logic. It relies on standard AWS SDK methods and printing output. No data leaks, injection points, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for listing AWS Glue databases and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign and intended for informational purposes.",
