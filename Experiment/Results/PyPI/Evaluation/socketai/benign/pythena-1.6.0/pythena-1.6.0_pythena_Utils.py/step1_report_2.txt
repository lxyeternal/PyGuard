  "purpose": "Retrieve and print a list of database names from AWS Glue service in a specified region.",
  "sources": "The code reads AWS credentials and configurations from the boto3 session, which may include environment variables, configuration files, or IAM roles.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data via print statements; no data is sent over the network or written to files.",
  "flows": "AWS SDK call to get_databases (source) -> data stored in 'databases' list -> printed via print_list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious data handling, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscation or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a boto3 session, creates a Glue client, and retrieves database information through paginated API calls. The data is collected into a list and then printed after sorting. The code appears to perform a straightforward, legitimate AWS SDK operation without any suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. No environment variables, credentials, or network activity beyond standard API calls are present. The functions are simple and serve a clear purpose of listing databases.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility to list AWS Glue databases. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It uses standard SDK practices and straightforward logic.",
