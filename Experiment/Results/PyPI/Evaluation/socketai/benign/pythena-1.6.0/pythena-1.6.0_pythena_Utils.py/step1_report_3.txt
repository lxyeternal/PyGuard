{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves and prints the list of database names from AWS Glue service.",
  "sources": "The function get_databases reads data from AWS Glue via boto3 client, specifically calling get_databases to retrieve database information. It may use optional session or region parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data to the console via print statements. No data is sent over network or stored persistently within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from AWS Glue's get_databases response (source) to the databases list, then to print_databases which calls print_list, resulting in console output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed. The code uses standard boto3 API calls and simple printing.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a boto3 session if none provided, creates a Glue client, retrieves all databases with pagination, and prints the sorted list. No suspicious or malicious behavior identified. The code's purpose appears straightforward: AWS resource enumeration. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. It functions solely to list and display database names, with proper handling of pagination.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign AWS resource enumeration script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply lists and prints database names from AWS Glue service.",
