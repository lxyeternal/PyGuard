  "purpose": "Retrieve and print the list of database names from AWS Glue service in a specified region.",
  "sources": "boto3.session.Session(), glue.get_databases()",
  "sinks": "print() function outputs, data returned by get_databases()",
  "flows": "session creation -> glue client call -> get_databases response -> iteration over DatabaseList -> output via print()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious data leaks, no unusual code behavior. Use of AWS SDK is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an AWS session, creates a Glue client, and iteratively fetches database names, storing them in a list. It then prints the sorted list. No suspicious or malicious operations are present. No hardcoded secrets, no data exfiltration, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscated code are evident. The code functions as a typical AWS resource listing script. It depends on AWS credentials configured in the environment but does not contain or invoke malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard script for listing AWS Glue databases, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical use of boto3 for resource enumeration without malicious activity.",
