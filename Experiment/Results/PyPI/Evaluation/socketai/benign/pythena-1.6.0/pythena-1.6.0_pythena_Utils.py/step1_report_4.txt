{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves and prints a list of AWS Glue databases using boto3.",
  "sources": "Input is indirectly from AWS API via boto3 client calls; no external user input is explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Data is printed to standard output; no data leaks or external transmissions are evident.",
  "flows": "The function get_databases() calls AWS API to get database list, which is then processed and displayed by print_databases() and print_list().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code constructs; standard boto3 usage. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a boto3 session (default or provided), creates a Glue client, and retrieves database names with pagination. Results are stored in a list and printed sorted. There are no suspicious data flows, no external data exfiltration, and no malicious behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and appears to be a typical AWS resource listing utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard AWS Glue database enumeration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign utility script for listing resources.",
