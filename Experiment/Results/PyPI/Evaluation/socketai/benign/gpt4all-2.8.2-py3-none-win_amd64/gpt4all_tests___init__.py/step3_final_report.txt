  "purpose": "Analysis of supply chain security and malicious behavior in the open source Python dependency, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, dynamic execution, and network activity.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, command-line arguments, files, network responses, input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, system calls, dynamic code execution functions ('eval', 'exec'), data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources feed into dynamic execution or network functions; untrusted input may flow into 'eval'/'exec' or network sockets.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'eval'/'exec' without validation, obfuscation of strings, network activity suspicious for exfiltration, incomplete or missing code, hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 indicates incomplete code with no clear malicious indicators, assigning low suspicion; Report 2 highlights dynamic code execution, obfuscation, and network activity, justifying high suspicion; Report 3 notes risky functions but no confirmed malicious payload; Reports 4 and 5 lack code, thus no risk. The scores align with the described behaviors: Report 2's high malware (0.6) and obfuscation (0.7) are justified by suspicious features; others are appropriately low. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the evidence, with Report 2 being the primary concern due to indicators of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits significant suspicious features in Report 2, warranting a high malware score, while other reports show minimal or no risk. The current scoring accurately reflects the analyzed behaviors. Continuous review of the full code, especially for Report 2, is recommended to confirm malicious intent.",
