  "purpose": "Import classes CancellationError, Embed4All, and GPT4All from the local module .gpt4all.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module .gpt4all.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code is a static import.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways; purely an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of classes from a local module. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling is evident. The import syntax is standard Python, and there are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or network activity. The minimal context indicates a benign, typical module import. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with malware scores at 0, obfuscation scores at 0, and very low security risk scores, which are appropriate given the simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores assigned in all reports are accurate; the minor security risk score in one report can be confidently set to 0. Overall, there is no evidence of malicious or suspicious activity.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
