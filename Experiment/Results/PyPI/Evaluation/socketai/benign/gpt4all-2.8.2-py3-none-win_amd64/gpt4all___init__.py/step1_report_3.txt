  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes from a local module named gpt4all, likely to use these classes in the larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module (.gpt4all), which reads the module's namespace.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present in this snippet; it only performs an import.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the import is static.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for Python module imports. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement importing three classes from a local module. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code does not perform any actions beyond importing symbols.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears to be a benign import statement with no malicious intent. It is typical for Python modules and contains no security concerns.",
