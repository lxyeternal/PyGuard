  "purpose": "A logging utility for colored console output, providing a configurable logging interface with color support.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters (__init__) for 'name', 'level', and 'text_color'; internal calls to colorlog.getLogger() and self.level property setters.",
  "sinks": "Logging methods (debug, info, warning, critical, error) that output messages to the console via colorlog.",
  "flows": "Constructor initializes logger and formatter with user-supplied or default parameters -> logging methods call colorlog.getLogger().<br>Property setters/getters modify logger levels based on input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Use of colorlog is standard; no suspicious data leaks or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configurable logging class leveraging the colorlog library, which is a common approach for colored terminal logs. Constructor sets up logger with specified name, level, and text color. The _set_level method interprets boolean and integer inputs to set standard logging levels, ensuring flexibility. Logging methods (debug, info, warning, critical, error) directly call colorlog's logger methods to output messages. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are read or transmitted. The code performs typical logging setup and usage without any apparent malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging utility with configurable colored output, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies. It appears safe and benign.",
