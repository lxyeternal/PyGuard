{
  "purpose": "A utility class for configuring and managing colored logging output in Python applications.",
  "sources": "Initialization of logger, formatter, and handler objects; input parameters for log level and text color; method calls to set or get logger levels.",
  "sinks": "Logger methods (debug, info, warning, error, critical) which output log messages to the console.",
  "flows": "Input parameters such as level and text_color influence logger configuration; log messages flow through logger methods to output handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious dynamic code execution observed. The code primarily manages logging configurations without external data fetching or network activities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Logging class that sets up colored console logging using the colorlog library. It configures formatter styles, log levels, and output handlers. Methods for adjusting levels interpret integer and boolean inputs, mapping them to string levels, and the logger outputs are standard log messages. There are no external data sources, file operations, or network communications. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign logging utility intended for enhanced console output with colors. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. It strictly manages logging configurations for Python applications.",
