  "purpose": "A utility class for creating and managing colorized logging in Python applications.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters for logger name, level, and text color; internal calls to getLogger and setLevel.",
  "sinks": "Logging methods that output messages; no data leaks or external data usage observed.",
  "flows": "Constructor initializes logger and formatter -> logging methods invoke getLogger and output messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Uses standard colorlog library for logging.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Logging class that configures a colorized logger using the colorlog library. It maps log levels and colors, initializes logger handlers, and provides methods for different log levels. The code appears to perform standard logging setup with no external data inputs or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious intent detected. The logging configuration is typical and uses public libraries as intended.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward logging utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly manages log levels and message formatting using the colorlog library. No anomalies or malicious activity identified.",
