  "purpose": "A colorized logging utility class for enhanced console output using the colorlog library.",
  "sources": "Initialization of logger, formatter, and handler; setting log levels and message formatting.",
  "sinks": "Logging messages to standard output via colorlog.StreamHandler.",
  "flows": "Messages logged through methods (debug, info, warning, error, critical) are processed by the logger and output to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, external data fetching, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a logging utility that configures colored output. It uses standard practices for setting log levels, formatting, and message output. No external data, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate and justified based on the code's behavior.",
