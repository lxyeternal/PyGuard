  "purpose": "Package initialization, version retrieval, and module imports for the 'easydev' library.",
  "sources": "Reading package name for version info via 'metadata.version', importing internal modules and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external network or file system operations with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Source: 'metadata.version' call; Sink: return statement; flows are straightforward and contained within safe functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: importing modules, retrieving package version info, and handling exceptions safely. All operations are static, with no external data processing or network activity. The code is clear, well-structured, and adheres to best practices, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not pose any security threat and is free of obfuscation. The minimal security risk is justified by its straightforward nature.",
