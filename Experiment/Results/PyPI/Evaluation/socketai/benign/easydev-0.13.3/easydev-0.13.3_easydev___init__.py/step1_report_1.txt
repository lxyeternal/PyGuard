{
  "purpose": "To provide utility functions for package version retrieval, module imports, and dependency management in the easydev software package.",
  "sources": "Metadata retrieval via importlib.metadata for package version; imports from local modules and dependencies; function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Return statements, import statements, and function calls that handle data or execute code.",
  "flows": "Metadata.version() retrieves package info; get_package_version() returns data; imported modules and functions executed or used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports various modules and dependencies, with a function to get package version information. It handles exceptions gracefully when the package is not found. All import statements appear legitimate, and the metadata retrieval uses standard Python library functions. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code structure is straightforward, and no external network calls or suspicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup for the easydev package, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions mainly as an import hub and version utility, with safe exception handling.",
