{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for a Python package, including version retrieval and importing various modules within the package.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata with 'metadata.version', importing local modules and submodules, importing functions and classes from submodules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; no network, file, or sensitive data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The use of standard library functions and local imports appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with metadata import and a function to retrieve package version, which is a typical pattern. It then imports numerous internal modules and specific functions. All imports are from the package's own namespace, with no external or malicious code execution. No untrusted input processing, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a typical package initialization or module setup script, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package module setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs safe imports and version management without executing untrusted data or suspicious operations.",
