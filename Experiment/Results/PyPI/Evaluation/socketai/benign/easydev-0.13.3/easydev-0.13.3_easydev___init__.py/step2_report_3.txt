  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily about package initialization, version retrieval, and module imports.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are identified across reports.\n- The code uses standard Python practices, such as `importlib.metadata` for version info, exception handling, and local module imports.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or code injection patterns are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score is slightly above zero, but the reasoning states there's no malicious behavior. The score seems somewhat high given the absence of suspicious activity.\n- **Recommendation:** The securityRisk should be lowered to 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the analysis. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly above zero but justified given the code's benign nature. Still, a zero security risk might be more appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Similar to report 3; the reasoning suggests minimal risk, so a zero score might be more accurate.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; no malicious activity, so a zero security risk score would be more consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Malware score:**\n- All reports correctly identify malware as 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### **Obfuscated score:**\n- All reports report 0, which is accurate given the straightforward code.\n\n### **Overall risk score:**\n- The risk scores are generally low, but some are slightly above zero without justification. Given the code's benign nature, I recommend setting all securityRisk scores to **0** for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard package initialization script with safe practices. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors are present. The minor securityRisk scores above zero should be adjusted to zero for consistency.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across reports.",
