{
  "purpose": "Provides a class for running multiple jobs asynchronously using multiprocessing.",
  "sources": "Imports time, multiprocessing.Pool, Process, Queue, cpu_count, and optional easydev.Progress.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code primarily manages process execution and results collection without handling untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "User adds jobs via add_job(); run() executes jobs asynchronously; callback collects results; no untrusted data flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of sleep delays and process management appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of multiprocessing job management. It initializes a process pool, adds jobs, and collects results asynchronously with optional progress display. No signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure and code logic are straightforward and align with standard multiprocessing practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign multiprocessing utility class with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It responsibly manages processes and results without suspicious operations or malicious signals.",
