{
  "purpose": "A multiprocessing utility class to run jobs asynchronously on a local machine with multiple CPUs.",
  "sources": "User-supplied functions added via add_job; system modules for process and signal handling.",
  "sinks": "Results collected in an internal Queue; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "User functions execute in separate processes; results are appended to the Queue and processed via callback.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard process management and signal handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard multiprocessing job manager, allowing users to add functions for parallel execution. It manages process creation, progress display, and result collection without any embedded network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The use of sleep delays and process control is typical. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The security considerations depend on the external functions supplied by users, which could be malicious, but this is outside the framework's scope. The code itself is benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard multiprocessing utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The inherent risk stems from user-supplied functions, not the framework itself. Scores are appropriately set: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
