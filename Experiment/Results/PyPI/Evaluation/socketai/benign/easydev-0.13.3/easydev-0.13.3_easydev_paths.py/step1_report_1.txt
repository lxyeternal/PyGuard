  "purpose": "Utilities for accessing shared data paths within Python packages, including locating package directories and files.",
  "sources": "Importing modules (importlib), accessing filesystem via os and pathlib, reading package files and directories.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem checks for directories and files, raising ValueError on missing directories/files.",
  "flows": "Import package -> locate package path -> determine shared directory -> verify directory existence -> access files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no use of environment variables for sensitive data, no network activity, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily uses standard library functions to locate package directories and shared resources, check directory and file existence, and raise exceptions if expected files or directories are missing. No suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent. Functions are straightforward, with no external network communication, no manipulation of sensitive data, and no execution of untrusted code. It does include print statements for debugging, which are benign and do not affect security. The code does not handle or process user input directly; it operates on filesystem paths and package modules. Overall, this code appears to be benign utility code for package resource management.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard utility functions for managing package shared data directories and files, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs filesystem operations securely without evident security risks.",
