  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for package resource management with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The minor bug in get_share_file should be fixed for correctness, but it does not pose security concerns. The current scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, though slightly increasing the risk score to 0.2 is advisable to account for the bug and error handling style."
