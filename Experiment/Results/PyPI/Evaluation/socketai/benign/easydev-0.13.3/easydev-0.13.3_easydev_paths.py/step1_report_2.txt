  "purpose": "Utilities for accessing shared data paths within Python packages, including locating package directories and files.",
  "sources": "Import statements, get_package_location function, os and importlib modules, environment variables indirectly through importlib, package data directories, and filenames.",
  "sinks": "File system access via os.path functions, directory and file existence checks, and path constructions.",
  "flows": "Import packages -> locate package file path -> determine share directory -> list directories or files -> access specific share files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of print statements for error messages instead of raising exceptions could leak info but is benign. No network or external data transmission observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to locate and access shared data directories within installed Python packages. It uses importlib to import modules and find their file locations, then searches for 'share' directories in multiple levels of parent directories to handle different install modes. Functions for listing directories and retrieving specific share files are included. No suspicious code patterns, no data exfiltration, no malicious behaviors, nor any dangerous system modifications are present. The only notable aspect is the print statement used for errors in get_shared_directory_path and get_share_file, which is not malicious but less secure than raising exceptions, though this does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely utility functions for package data management with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard filesystem and package location operations without any suspicious or harmful behaviors.",
