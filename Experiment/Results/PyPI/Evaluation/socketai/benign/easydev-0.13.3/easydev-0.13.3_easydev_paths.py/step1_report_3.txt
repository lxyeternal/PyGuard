  "purpose": "Utilities for accessing shared data paths within Python packages, including locating package directories and shared resource files.",
  "sources": "Import statements, package name input parameters, os.path and importlib functions, os.listdir and os.path.isdir calls.",
  "sinks": "os.path.join, os.path.isfile, os.path.isdir, os.listdir, and print statements that handle file paths and directories.",
  "flows": "Package name input -> get_package_location -> get_shared_directory_path -> get_shared_directories / get_share_file functions -> file and directory checks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret data. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code. Use of print for debugging may be unnecessary but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for locating shared resource directories and files within Python packages. It uses standard importlib to locate package files and os.path methods to verify directory existence. It searches parent directories for 'share' folders, which is typical for package data access. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, backdoors, or code injection. The use of print statements for error reporting is benign in this context. The functions perform file system checks and path manipulations securely, with no evident injection points or untrusted input handling beyond basic parameters, which are expected to be trusted in package resource management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for package resource management with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It does not perform any harmful actions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or executing untrusted code. The security risk score is very low.",
