  "sources": "importlib.import_module, os.path functions, os.listdir, package parameters",
  "sinks": "Filesystem operations, directory and file existence checks",
  "flows": "Package import -> locate __file__ -> construct 'share' paths -> check directory existence -> list files",
  "anomalies": "Minor bug in get_share_file: incorrect use of os.path.isfile(x) instead of os.path.isfile(os.path.join(fullpath, x)); use of print statements for error reporting instead of exceptions",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem operations to locate package share directories and files. No malicious activity, network communication, or code injection is present. The only notable issue is a bug in get_share_file's file validation logic, which could lead to incorrect behavior but not security risks. The use of print statements for error messages is benign but not ideal. The overall structure is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for package resource management with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The minor bug in get_share_file should be fixed for correctness, but it does not pose security concerns. The current scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, though slightly increasing the risk score to 0.2 is advisable to account for the bug and error handling style.",
