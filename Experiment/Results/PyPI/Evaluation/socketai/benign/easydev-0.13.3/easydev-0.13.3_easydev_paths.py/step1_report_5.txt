  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to access shared data paths within installed Python packages.",
  "sources": "Import statements, get_package_location function, get_shared_directory_path, get_shared_directories, gsf, get_share_file functions.",
  "sinks": "os.path functions (realpath, isdir, isfile, listdir), print statements, exception raising.",
  "flows": "Functions use package import and file system checks to locate directories and files; no untrusted input flows into insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of print statements for debug info is benign. No code injection or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code safely uses importlib to locate package paths and os.path to handle filesystem paths. No user input is directly used to construct paths; all filesystem operations are based on package metadata. The functions perform directory checks and list files, which are standard and do not involve untrusted external data sources or execution. The print statements are benign debug messages and do not indicate malicious activity. No obfuscated or unusual language features are used. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent within this module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for package data path resolution. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The use of filesystem operations and package import mechanisms is standard and safe. No malicious signals detected.",
