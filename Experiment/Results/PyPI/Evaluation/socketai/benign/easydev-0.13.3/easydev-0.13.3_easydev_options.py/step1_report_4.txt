{
  "purpose": "Define a custom formatter class for argparse that preserves the formatting of help messages, allowing for formatted help text in command-line applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports (argparse), class definitions, and string data within the _split_lines method.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted in a vulnerable way.",
  "flows": "The code creates a class that modifies how help message formatting is handled, primarily reading from predefined string data and method calls within the class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. The code simply extends argparse formatting behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library (argparse) and defines a subclass of HelpFormatter that conditionally splits lines based on a prefix 'FORMAT|'. It avoids any external network, file, or environment variable access. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues. The class is well-documented and intended for formatting help messages in CLI applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility class intended to enhance help message formatting for command-line interfaces. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
