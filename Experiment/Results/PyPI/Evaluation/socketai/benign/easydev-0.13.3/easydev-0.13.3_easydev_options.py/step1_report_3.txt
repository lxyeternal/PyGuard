{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom formatter class for use with argparse to preserve help message formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines a class and imports a module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present; no data leaks or effects are possible.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows; the code does not process external data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is standard for customizing argparse help formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward subclass of argparse.HelpFormatter with an override of _split_lines to optionally split lines if the help text starts with 'FORMAT|'. No external inputs or outputs are handled. The code includes no network activity, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be a benign utility class aimed at formatting help messages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility class with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard code for customizing help message formatting in command-line applications.",
