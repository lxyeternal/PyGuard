  "purpose": "A utility class for customizing help message formatting in command-line applications by overriding the line splitting behavior based on a specific prefix.",
  "sources": "The help text strings passed to the formatter, specifically those starting with 'FORMAT|'.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; the code does not process external data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Help text strings are passed to the formatter; if they start with 'FORMAT|', the string after the prefix is split into lines; otherwise, default behavior applies. No external data flow or untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a conditional check for a specific string prefix ('FORMAT|') to alter line splitting, which is benign and intended for formatting purposes. No other anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a subclass of argparse.HelpFormatter that overrides _split_lines to handle help text starting with 'FORMAT|'. It does not process external input, execute dynamic code, or handle untrusted data. The implementation is straightforward, well-documented, and serves a formatting purpose. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is simple and safe, with no external dependencies or network activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for formatting help messages with no malicious intent or security risks. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
