  "purpose": "Define a custom help formatter for argparse to preserve formatting in help messages.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines a class and imports argparse.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only modifies help message formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and follows standard practices. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports argparse and defines a subclass SmartFormatter that overrides _split_lines to optionally split lines based on a prefix 'FORMAT|'. The class is intended for use with argparse to preserve custom formatting in help messages. The implementation is standard, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. No external data handling or dangerous operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility class for formatting argparse help messages. It does not contain malicious intent or security risks.",
