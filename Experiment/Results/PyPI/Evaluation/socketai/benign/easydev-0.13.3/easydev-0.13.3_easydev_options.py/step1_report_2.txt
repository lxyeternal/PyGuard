  "purpose": "Define a custom help formatter class for argparse to preserve formatting of help messages.",
  "sources": "Imports argparse; the class itself, especially the _split_lines method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, no sinks that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Input: help text strings fed to _split_lines; Output: processed help lines, no transformation leading to malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be a straightforward subclass with a conditional for custom formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports argparse and defines a subclass SmartFormatter that overrides _split_lines to preserve custom formatting when help text starts with 'FORMAT|'. The override is benign, simply splitting the string after the prefix. The rest of the code is standard class documentation and example usage. No external input, untrusted data, or dynamic code execution is present. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are observed. The purpose is purely to improve help message formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign customization of argparse help formatter. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and safe.",
