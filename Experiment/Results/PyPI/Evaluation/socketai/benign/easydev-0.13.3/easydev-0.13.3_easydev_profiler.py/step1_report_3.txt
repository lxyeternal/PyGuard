  "purpose": "Provides a decorator for profiling Python functions using line_profiler, with optional fallback if the library is not installed.",
  "sources": "Imports line_profiler from an external package; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output affecting security.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing a profiling library and defining a decorator that wraps functions for profiling; no external data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code conditionally defines functions based on the presence of an external package.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'LineProfiler' and defines 'do_profile' as a decorator for profiling functions. If the package is absent, it issues a warning and defines a no-op decorator. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and adheres to normal profiling patterns without any suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign utility for function profiling with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It gracefully handles missing dependencies and does not perform any harmful actions.",
