  "purpose": "Provide a decorator for profiling functions using line_profiler if available.",
  "sources": "Imports from line_profiler, the decorator functions, and the print statement in the except block.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or untrusted data processing points.",
  "flows": "Import line_profiler -> define do_profile -> use decorator to profile functions -> fallback to warning message if import fails.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code performs standard function wrapping and import handling with a warning message.",
  "analysis": "The code imports line_profiler and defines a decorator to profile functions if the module is available. It handles ImportError by providing a no-op decorator that only prints a warning. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or data leaks. No obfuscated or malicious behavior is detected. The only noteworthy aspect is the warning message if line_profiler is missing, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a profiling decorator with a fallback warning. There is no malicious intent or malicious code present. It is safe and serves a development purpose.",
