  "purpose": "A decorator for profiling Python functions using line_profiler, with fallback behavior if the package is not installed.",
  "sources": "Import of line_profiler and the decorator function definition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data flows; the code only prints warnings.",
  "flows": "Import line_profiler -> define do_profile -> decorate functions or fallback warning.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with proper error handling and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import line_profiler; if successful, it creates a profiling decorator that adds functions to the profiler and prints stats after execution. If not, it warns the user and returns a decorator that simply calls the original function. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive behavior is present. The fallback is benign, merely informing the user about missing dependencies. The code is well-structured, with appropriate exception handling and no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for profiling functions, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified.",
