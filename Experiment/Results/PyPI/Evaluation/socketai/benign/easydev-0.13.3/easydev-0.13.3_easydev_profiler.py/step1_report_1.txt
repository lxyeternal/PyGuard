  "purpose": "Provide a decorator to profile Python functions using line_profiler, with fallback behavior if the package is not installed.",
  "sources": "Import statement for line_profiler; usage of line_profiler's LineProfiler class; function definitions do_profile and nested functions.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or sensitive data leaks.",
  "flows": "If line_profiler is installed: decorator adds functions to the profiler and prints stats; if not installed: prints a warning and returns the original function unchanged.",
  "anomalies": "None apparent; code is straightforward and typical for a profiling utility, with proper fallback when dependency is missing.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import line_profiler's LineProfiler. If successful, it defines a decorator that profiles the wrapped function and any follow functions, then prints profiling stats. If the import fails, it issues a warning and returns a decorator that simply calls the original function without profiling. There are no suspicious code injections, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code is for profiling and contains no obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard profiling utility with a safe fallback; no malicious or malicious intent detected. It is well-structured, with proper error handling and no hidden malicious behavior.",
