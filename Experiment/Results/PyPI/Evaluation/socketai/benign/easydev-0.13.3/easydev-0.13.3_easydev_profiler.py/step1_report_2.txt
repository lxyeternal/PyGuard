{
  "purpose": "Provide a profiling decorator for functions using line_profiler, with fallback if the package is not installed.",
  "sources": "Import statement for line_profiler, usage of the LineProfiler class, print statement in the except block",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data flows into critical system operations or data leaks",
  "flows": "Code imports line_profiler, defines do_profile function that either creates a profiler object and executes profiling or prints a warning and runs the function normally",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with conditional import handling and standard function decorators",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator do_profile that wraps functions for profiling if line_profiler is available. It uses conditional import to avoid dependency issues and provides a fallback implementation. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The print warning is benign, informing about missing dependency. No external data leaks, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for profiling functions, with safe handling for missing dependencies. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
