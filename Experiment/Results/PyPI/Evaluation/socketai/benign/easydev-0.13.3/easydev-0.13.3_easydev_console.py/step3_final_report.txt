  "purpose": "Utility functions for terminal output formatting, including color support detection and terminal width measurement.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., 'COLUMNS', 'TERM', 'COLORTERM'), sys.stdout attributes, and platform information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and sys.stdout attributes influence color support and terminal width detection; no malicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical errors: 'platform.platform.lower' should be 'platform.platform().lower()' and 'plf.starstwith' should be 'plf.startswith'. These cause runtime errors but are not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for terminal styling and width detection. The main issues are minor typos affecting platform detection logic, which could cause runtime errors but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The dynamic creation of color functions and the use of standard environment variables are typical for such utilities. The exception handling in get_terminal_width() is broad but standard for fallback robustness. Overall, the code is benign, with minor bugs that impact functionality but not security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign terminal utility with minor implementation bugs (typos) that could cause runtime errors but pose no security threats or malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting minor bugs without security implications.",
