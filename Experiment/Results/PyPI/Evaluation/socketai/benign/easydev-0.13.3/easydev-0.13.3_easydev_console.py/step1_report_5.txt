No flow indicates untrusted input being processed insecurely.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"Typo in 'platform.platform.lower()' as 'platform.platform.lower' (missing parentheses). The check 'plf.starstwith(\"win\")' contains a typo in 'startswith'. Exception handling is broad, which may obscure errors but not malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The script's primary function is to facilitate colored terminal output and adapt to terminal dimensions. It conditionally imports colorama on Windows systems but contains a typo ('starstwith') that prevents correct execution on Windows. Environment variables like 'COLORTERM' and 'TERM' are used to determine color support, which is typical. Functions for color application and terminal size detection are straightforward, with no malicious logic present. The broad exception handling in get_terminal_width() is standard but unrefined; no evidence of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code appears to be a utility for managing terminal display features, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. The only notable issues are minor typos that could cause runtime errors but do not indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.1\n}",
