  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate configuration management utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and low risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) due to filesystem operations, which are typical in such utilities."
