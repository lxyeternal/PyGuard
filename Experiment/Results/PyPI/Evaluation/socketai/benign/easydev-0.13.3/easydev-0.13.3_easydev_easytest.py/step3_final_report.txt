  "purpose": "Utility functions for testing assertions, attribute manipulation, and temporary file handling in Python.",
  "sources": "Input data is not read; functions operate on provided parameters and internal tempfile objects.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or data exfiltration points present.",
  "flows": "Functions manipulate in-memory data, attributes, and temporary files without external data flow or malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard use of tempfile and property manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for testing and temporary file management. It does not handle external inputs that could be malicious, nor does it perform network operations or data leaks. The attribute setting logic is standard, and tempfile usage is safe. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The functions are simple, well-structured, and serve benign purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
