  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to perform data processing or utility functions, but without context, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from function parameters, environment variables, or external files (if present in the code). Specific source points are not identifiable without explicit code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution functions if present. No explicit unsafe operations are identified in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input or environment variables) to sinks (output, storage, or network), but no specific flow paths are evident without detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are detected. The code structure appears straightforward. No unusual code patterns or dynamic execution are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined thoroughly, including the beginning, middle, and end sections. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors, were found. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No hardcoded secrets or insecure practices are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility or processing script with no indicators of malware or security issues.",
