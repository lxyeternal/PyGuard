{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the Python package 'fragile', including dependencies, metadata, and versioning.",
  "sources": "Import statements for loading version info and reading README.md; static definitions of dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or data leaks; the code primarily handles package setup.",
  "flows": "Version info loaded from external file to package metadata; dependencies read from static lists; README content read into description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.machinery.SourceFileLoader for version import is somewhat uncommon but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads version information from an external version.py file, reads a README.md file for long description, and specifies dependencies and package metadata for setup. The dependencies are statically listed; no user input or untrusted data is processed. The import of version info is handled via SourceFileLoader, which is a standard way but slightly unusual. No suspicious behavior, such as network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated code, is present. The code strictly performs package setup tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network communication, data leakage, or suspicious behavior.",
