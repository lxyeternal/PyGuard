  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package called 'fragile' with its dependencies and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'fragile/version.py', reads 'README.md' for long description, defines dependency groups, and gathers package files.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Version module loaded from file; dependencies and metadata gathered for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The version is dynamically loaded, which is common.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures, including dynamic loading of version info, reading long description, defining dependencies, and configuring package metadata. No suspicious or malicious activities are evident. The code uses common Python package management patterns and does not execute any untrusted or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It follows standard practices for package distribution without any suspicious behavior.",
