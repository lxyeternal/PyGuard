  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Loads version info from `fragile/version.py` via `SourceFileLoader`.\n- Reads `README.md` for long description.\n- Defines dependency groups (`extras`).\n- Calls `setuptools.setup()` with package metadata.\n- No code execution beyond static imports and file reads.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or network activity.\n- Uses standard Python packaging patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity, no malware, no anomalies.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The code is standard, and no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, notes the uncommon use of `SourceFileLoader` but not malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. Slightly unusual but not suspicious.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard setup script, no malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Also describes a typical setup script, notes no suspicious code, mentions `securityRisk` score of 0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Slightly conservative but acceptable; no actual malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard package setup, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code only loads version info, reads a README, and sets up package metadata.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; all reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk scores:** Given the code's nature, a low risk score (around 0.1) is reasonable, reflecting minimal risk due to dynamic version loading but not malicious.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The use of `SourceFileLoader` is somewhat uncommon but not malicious; it's a legitimate way to load version info dynamically.\n- No network activity, no code injection, no handling of untrusted input, no hardcoded secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|------------------|------------|\n| **0.0**         | **0.0**          | **0.1**    |\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a straightforward setup script.\n- No malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- The minor security risk score reflects the dynamic import pattern but is not indicative of actual danger.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **The code is a legitimate Python package setup script.**\n- **No malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present.**\n- **Scores should be:**\n  - Malware: **0.0**\n  - Obfuscated: **0.0**\n  - Risk: **0.1**\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews and the nature of the code.",
