  "purpose": "This code is for setting up and configuring a Python package named 'fragile', including version loading, reading a README file, defining dependencies, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Loading version from 'fragile/version.py' using importlib, reading 'README.md' from the current directory, and defining dependencies within the script.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data is written to external systems, executed, or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "The version information is imported and stored, dependencies are defined, and package setup is configured; data flows from source files to package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are present. The code performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script loads version info dynamically from a local file, reads a README for long description, defines dependencies with potential optional groups, and calls setuptools.setup with metadata. No untrusted inputs, malicious code, or suspicious behavior observed. The code appears to be a standard package setup script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks securely.",
