  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard setup script; no suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code performs typical package setup tasks, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard practices, with slight note on the uncommon use of `SourceFileLoader` but nothing malicious.\n- **Assessment:** The use of `SourceFileLoader` is somewhat unusual but not suspicious or malicious. No malicious behavior is identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard setup script, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; confirms the code is typical and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Also finds no suspicious behavior but assigns a small security risk score of 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Given the code is a straightforward setup script, a risk score of 0.1 might be slightly overstated. The only minor point is the dynamic import, which is common and not inherently risky.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — acceptable, but perhaps slightly high.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, no malicious activity; notes the dynamic version loading as standard.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; confirms safety.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior—no network activity, no code injection, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dependencies.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0; the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—a standard setup script—any risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The small 0.1 scores in some reports seem to reflect a conservative approach to potential minor concerns like dynamic import, but in context, this is standard practice.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical Python package setup script.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The dynamic loading of version info is common and not suspicious.\n- No untrusted data is processed or transmitted.\n- Dependency lists are standard and contain no suspicious entries.\n\n### **My assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no significant security risk detected)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, clean, and performs standard package setup tasks without any malicious or obfuscated elements.",
