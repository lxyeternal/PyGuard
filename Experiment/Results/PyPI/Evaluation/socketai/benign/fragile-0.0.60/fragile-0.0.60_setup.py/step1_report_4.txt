{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project called 'fragile', defining dependencies, metadata, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Loading version information from 'fragile/version.py', reading 'README.md', defining dependencies and package data, and setting up package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None of the code appears to process untrusted input or output data directly; it mainly defines configuration for packaging.",
  "flows": "N/A - the script does not handle untrusted data flows; it is a standard setup script.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. All dependencies are typical for a Python package setup. The import of 'SourceFileLoader' for versioning is a common pattern.",
  "analysis": "The script loads version info from an external 'version.py' file, reads the README for long description, defines dependency groups, and sets up package metadata for distribution. The dependencies listed are standard and do not contain suspicious entries. The use of 'SourceFileLoader' to load version info is a typical approach. There are no hardcoded credentials, network connections, or executable code that could be malicious. The script appears to be a standard, well-structured package setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional Python setup script for packaging. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. It is safe for use.",
