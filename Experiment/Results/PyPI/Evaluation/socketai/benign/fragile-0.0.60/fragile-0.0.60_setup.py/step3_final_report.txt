{
  "purpose": "Load version info dynamically, read README for long description, define dependencies, and set up package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Importing version module via SourceFileLoader; reading README.md file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data transmission; static file reads only.",
  "flows": "SourceFileLoader loads version.py; README.md content assigned to long_description.",
  "anomalies": "Uncommon use of SourceFileLoader for version import but not malicious; no suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks with dynamic version loading, which is a legitimate pattern. No network activity, no handling of untrusted input, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Dependency lists are typical. The use of SourceFileLoader is slightly unusual but not suspicious. Overall, the script is a straightforward setup configuration with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor dynamic import pattern does not pose any threat. The security risk score should be minimal, and malware and obfuscation scores are zero.",
