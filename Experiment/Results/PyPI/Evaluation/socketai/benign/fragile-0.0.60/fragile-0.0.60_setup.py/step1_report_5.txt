{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'fragile'. It manages dependencies, metadata, and package configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads the version from 'fragile/version.py' using importlib.machinery, reads 'README.md' for long description, and defines dependencies for different extras.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any untrusted data sinks such as network operations, file writes of unvalidated input, or execution of code based on external input.",
  "flows": "The version is loaded dynamically from a local file; dependencies are set statically; no external untrusted data flows to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The dynamic import of 'version.py' is standard practice, not obfuscated. The code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script loads version info dynamically, reads README content for documentation, and defines dependencies for different optional groups. All operations are standard for Python packaging. No code injection, malicious network activity, or obfuscation is present. The dependencies listed are typical for a machine learning framework. The script's structure and content are consistent with normal package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues. It performs typical package metadata and dependency management without any suspicious behavior.",
