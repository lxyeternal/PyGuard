  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence, reasoning, and scores provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Loads version info via `SourceFileLoader` from an external `version.py`.\n- Reads `README.md` for long description.\n- Defines dependency groups and package metadata.\n- Uses standard setup practices with `setuptools`.\n- No untrusted data is processed or transmitted.\n- No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no malware, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is standard, straightforward, and secure.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Slightly unusual use of `SourceFileLoader` but not malicious; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0.95.\n- **Assessment:** The high obfuscation score seems unwarranted. The use of `SourceFileLoader` is standard for dynamic import, not obfuscation.\n- **Recommendation:** Lower obfuscated score to 0, as no obfuscation is evident.\n- **Risk Score:** Correct at 0, since no malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** Standard setup script, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n- **Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no secrets, no network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** The security risk is marked as 0.1, but the explanation suggests no real security risk exists.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce `securityRisk` to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** Standard setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** The security risk score is slightly elevated without justification.\n- **Recommendation:** Set `securityRisk` to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusions:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; thus, malware should be 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Only Report 2's high obfuscation score is unjustified; should be lowered to 0.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated in Reports 4 and 5 without justification; should be 0.\n\n---\n\n### **My estimated scores after review:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | SecurityRisk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n- The code is a typical, legitimate Python package setup script.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- Scores should be uniformly low, with zeroes for malware and obfuscation, and zero for security risk unless justified.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, and the reports mostly agree. The main correction is lowering the obfuscation and security risk scores in Reports 2, 4, and 5 to 0.",
