{
  "purpose": "Suppress deprecation and warning messages related to Python standard libraries and third-party packages, and import version info from 'fragile.version'.",
  "sources": "Warning filters set for specific warning messages; import of __version__ from fragile.version.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; purely configuration and import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; warning suppression and version import are isolated setup steps.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out import statements are benign; no suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code only manages warning filters and imports a version string. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs. The suppression of warnings is standard practice but could obscure deprecation notices, which is noted in the risk score. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The overall structure is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for maintaining compatibility and cleaner logs. All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, with appropriate low risk scores justified by warning suppression practices. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious behavior. The minimal risk score (0.1) reflects the potential for warning suppression to hide future deprecation issues but does not pose an immediate security threat.",
