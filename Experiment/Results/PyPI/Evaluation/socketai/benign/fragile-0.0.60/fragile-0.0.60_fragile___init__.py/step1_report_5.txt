{
  "purpose": "To suppress specific warning messages related to deprecated features in Python libraries and to import version information from a package.",
  "sources": "Warnings filter configurations; import statement for package version",
  "sinks": "No evident data sink operations or data leaks; no outputs or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks identified",
  "anomalies": "The code only suppresses warnings and includes an import statement; no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident",
  "analysis": "The code configures multiple warning filters to suppress deprecation warnings from various Python libraries, likely to prevent cluttering logs during execution. It includes commented-out import statements and an import of a package's version. No user input, external data sources, or sensitive operations are present. The purpose appears solely to manage warnings for compatibility and informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focused on warning suppression and version import, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity detected.",
