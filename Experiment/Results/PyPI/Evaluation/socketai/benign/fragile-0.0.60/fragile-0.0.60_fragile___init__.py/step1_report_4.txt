{
  "purpose": "The code sets up warning filters and imports a version attribute from a package, likely for initializing or configuring a framework for FAI (perhaps 'Fair AI') algorithms development.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for warning messages and imports a version attribute from an external package 'fragile'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leaks or external communications are evident.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are apparent; the code primarily configures warnings and performs a package import.",
  "anomalies": "All warning messages are standard deprecation notices; the import statement is straightforward. The commented-out import lines do not contain malicious code. No unusual patterns or hidden code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly filters out specific deprecation warnings related to Python standard libraries and third-party packages, such as 'collections', 'imp', and 'matplotlib'. These warnings are typical for maintaining compatibility and are not malicious. The import from 'fragile.version' is a normal practice to access package version info. There are no indications of obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious behavior. The commented-out import statements suggest possible modular code but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script configuring warning filters and importing a version string. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious data flows, or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
