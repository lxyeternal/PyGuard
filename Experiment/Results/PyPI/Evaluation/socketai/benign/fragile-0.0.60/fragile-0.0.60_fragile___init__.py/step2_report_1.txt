  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the validity of their conclusions and scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code only performs warning suppression and imports a version string.\n- No data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads.\n- Commented-out imports are benign and do not execute.\n- The purpose appears to be maintaining compatibility and clean runtime logs.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Suppressing deprecation warnings related to Python and matplotlib.\n- No suspicious activity.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues found; code is benign.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correct; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Reasonable; malware and risk are zero.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Similar warning suppression and version import.\n- Notes that suppression can hide important deprecation notices.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (small concern about hiding warnings)\n\n**Assessment:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; code is benign.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correct; warning suppression is common but can obscure future issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware remains zero; security risk is minimal, justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound reasoning; scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Warning suppression and version import.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- **Issue presence:** None.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Warning suppression and version import.\n- No malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- **Issue presence:** None.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Warning suppression and version import.\n- No suspicious activity.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- **Issue presence:** None.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code, this is accurate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All are very low, justified by the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimation:**\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 (due to warning suppression potentially hiding future deprecation issues, but not a security risk per se)\n\n**Note:** While warning suppression can be considered a minor security concern if it hides important deprecation notices, in this context, it is standard practice and does not constitute a security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, consistent, and reasonable. No malicious activity or security risks are evident in this code snippet.",
