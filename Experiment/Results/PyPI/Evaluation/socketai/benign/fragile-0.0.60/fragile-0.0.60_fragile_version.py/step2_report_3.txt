  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic behavior, external data handling, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is static and straightforward, serving as project metadata.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - No logical errors or overstatements are evident.\n   - The conclusion that the code is benign and poses no security risk is justified.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign `securityRisk` and `malware` scores of 0, and the code is a static version string, there is no basis for higher scores.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data processing.\n\n5. **Malware Score and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n   - The code is purely metadata; no malware risk is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and do not assume malicious intent; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Suggested scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code snippet is a standard, harmless version declaration with no security concerns.",
