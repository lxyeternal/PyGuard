  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe, and well-designed swarm simulation framework. It contains no malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low security risk score appropriately reflects the minimal inherent risk, primarily due to callback extensibility. Overall, the code is suitable for deployment with standard precautions regarding callback security."
