  "purpose": "Define various policy classes for reinforcement learning, including random, discrete, binary swap, and continuous policies with different sampling strategies.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment attributes (e.g., sample_action, action_space, bounds), swarm properties (e.g., n_actives), and external parameters (e.g., loc, scale). Data is read mainly during setup and action sampling.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur if environment or policy attributes are manipulated in malicious ways, such as altering sampling methods or input/output data. No direct sinks for untrusted data are evident; code primarily samples and manipulates in-memory data.",
  "flows": "Input environment attributes flow into setup methods to determine sampling functions. Data from these functions flow into action selection methods. No external network or file IO occurs in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to implement standard policy behaviors, with extensive use of environment attributes and sampling functions. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple policy classes with setup and action sampling methods. Setup functions dynamically assign sampling methods based on environment attributes, which is standard. Action sampling uses numpy, judo, and random_state for generating actions, with no external or hidden side effects. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears legitimate for RL policy implementations, with well-defined functions and no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is consistent with typical RL policy class definitions. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It appears safe and purpose-built for in-memory policy sampling. The overall security risk is minimal.",
