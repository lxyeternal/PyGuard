{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for environment simulation and mathematical function optimization, primarily used for reinforcement learning and optimization tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method arguments such as actions, states, observations, and environment info; it also reads configuration attributes like bounds and environment properties.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the `step` and `reset` methods where data is processed and returned, but no untrusted data is written to external systems, files, or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input data from actions and states are processed within environment steps; outputs include updated states, observations, rewards, and info. Data flows are internal to the environment methods, with no external or network data transfer observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hard-coded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. No use of obfuscated or misleading variable names; code functions align with standard environment simulation and mathematical modeling tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code provides environment wrappers and a mathematical function class, with proper handling of inputs, outputs, and internal state updates. The `step` and `reset` methods perform standard environment simulation tasks without external communication. The `Function` class generates random samples within bounds and evaluates functions securely. No external network calls, file manipulations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be well-structured, with appropriate use of type hints, error checks, and no evident malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for simulation environments and mathematical function optimization. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected. It is safe and aligns with expected usage for such classes.",
