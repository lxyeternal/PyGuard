{
  "purpose": "The code provides environment wrappers for simulation and a class for mathematical function optimization within specified bounds.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment methods (reset, step_batch), function inputs, and sampling routines.",
  "sinks": "No external data exfiltration, network communication, or file operations detected.",
  "flows": "Internal data flow within environment methods, sampling, and function evaluations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for environment management and function optimization, utilizing common libraries (numpy, judo). It performs internal data handling, sampling within bounds, and environment stepping without external communication or malicious code. No signs of sabotage, data leakage, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by external environment dependencies but no malicious activity.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
