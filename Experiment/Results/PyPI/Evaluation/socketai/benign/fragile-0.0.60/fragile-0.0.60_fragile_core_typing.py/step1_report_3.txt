{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and imports for a tensor-based graph or data processing module, facilitating type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'typing', 'judo.judo_backend', and 'numpy'; variable annotations and type alias assignments.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines types and imports, with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code detected. The import from 'judo.judo_backend' could be scrutinized, but without further context, it appears to be a legitimate local or third-party module.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes type aliases for tensors, node data, and distance functions, using standard Python typing features. The import from 'judo.judo_backend' could be a custom or third-party module, but there's no evidence of malicious intent. No data processing, input/output handling, or dynamic code execution occurs here. The code appears straightforward and intended for type safety and clarity in a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This module serves as a type annotation and import setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard for a scientific or graph-processing Python project.",
