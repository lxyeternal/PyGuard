  "purpose": "Type aliases and module imports for tensor and graph data structures in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'judo.judo_backend' for torch and standard Python typing modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code is purely type setup.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; only static type alias definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import source 'judo.judo_backend' for torch, but no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and type alias definitions with no executable logic. The import from 'judo.judo_backend' is atypical but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The malware score is justified as 0, reflecting no malicious intent. The security risk score is low (~0.1), primarily due to the unconventional import source, but this does not indicate an active threat. Confidence in benign assessment is high (around 0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a setup for type annotations and module imports. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The import source warrants further context but does not constitute a threat on its own. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
