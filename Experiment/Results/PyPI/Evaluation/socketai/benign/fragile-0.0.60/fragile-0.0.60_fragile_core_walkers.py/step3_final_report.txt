{
  "purpose": "The code manages a swarm of walkers, including scoring, diversity measurement, cloning, and exploration strategies, primarily for reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithms.",
  "sources": "Data is read from rewards, scores, observations, infos, and environment states; no external untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Internal data flows are used for calculations; no external data leaks, network communication, or malicious sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input signals (rewards, scores, infos) through internal computations (e.g., relativize, clone probabilities) to update walker states and generate clone decisions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. Use of standard libraries and randomness is typical for such algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of swarm management, scoring, diversity, and cloning logic. It employs standard numerical operations, randomness, and state updates without external communication or malicious payloads. No signs of obfuscation, sabotage, or malicious behavior are present. The use of 'judo' and 'random_state' is standard for stochastic algorithms. The logic for clone probability, virtual rewards, and diversity calculations aligns with typical reinforcement learning practices. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. It is a standard implementation for swarm-based algorithms, with no external malicious activity or vulnerabilities detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified.",
