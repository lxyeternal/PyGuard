  "purpose": "Package setup, version management, type validation, and assembly loading in a JSII/CDK context.",
  "sources": "Reading package version via importlib.metadata, dynamic loading of __jsii_assembly__, and the call to publication.publish().",
  "sinks": "publication.publish() potentially exposing metadata; __jsii_assembly__ loading from external source.",
  "flows": "Version retrieval -> assembly load -> publish call.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code. Assembly load from external resource is standard but warrants source trust.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package initialization routines with external assembly loading and publication. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The assembly load is typical in JSII projects but should be verified for source integrity. The publication call is part of normal publishing workflows. The typeguard configuration is version-dependent but straightforward. Overall, the code appears benign, with minimal security risk primarily associated with trusting external sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script for a JSII-based Python package. No signs of malicious activity or supply chain attack vectors are present. The external assembly load and publication are typical but should be verified for source trustworthiness. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minor concerns over external dependencies.",
