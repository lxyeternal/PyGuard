{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up package extensions, import necessary modules, and define a type checking function, likely for runtime validation and package initialization.",
  "sources": "Import statements, particularly reading from 'pkgutil', 'importlib.metadata', and module attributes such as '__path__' and '__name__'.",
  "sinks": "The 'check_type' function calls 'typeguard.check_type' which can be a sink for data validation, but no untrusted data flows are evident in the code.",
  "flows": "Input sources (module attributes, imported modules) do not flow into any sinks. The 'check_type' function is called with controlled parameters, with no indication of untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports modules and sets configurations without any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The only potentially notable aspect is the dynamic loading of a JSII assembly, which is typical for CDK/JSII integrations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package extension setup, module imports, and defines a type checking wrapper function that adjusts behavior based on version. The '__jsii_assembly__' loads an external JSII assembly, which is a common pattern for CDK provider packages. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious data flows. No hardcoded credentials or malicious network activity are present. The code appears to be legitimate for its purpose of package initialization and type validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for package setup involving JSII and type validation, with no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It functions as intended for package initialization and runtime type checking without any malicious behavior.",
