{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Terraform provider class for 'local' resources, including configuration data structures and methods for resource import and attribute synthesis.",
  "sources": "The code reads type hints, configuration parameters (like 'alias'), and environment variables for versioning.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to or execute untrusted data sources; it invokes library functions and manages configuration data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., 'scope', 'id', 'alias') are checked via typeguard functions, then used to instantiate provider objects or generate import configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code uses standard library modules and type safety checks. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Terraform provider class with associated configuration data. It employs type checks and standard library functions to ensure correct usage. No external data sources are read at runtime beyond input parameters. There are no dynamic code execution, network communication, or data leaks present. The structure and functions adhere to typical provider patterns, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, safe implementation of a Terraform provider wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
