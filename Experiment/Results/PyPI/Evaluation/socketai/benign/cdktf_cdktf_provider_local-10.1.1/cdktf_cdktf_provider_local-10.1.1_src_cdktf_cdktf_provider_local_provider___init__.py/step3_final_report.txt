  "purpose": "A Python class implementing a Terraform provider for HashiCorp's 'local' resource, utilizing jsii for cross-language support, with configuration, import, and attribute synthesis methods.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters, environment metadata, and uses jsii functions for object creation and method invocation.",
  "sinks": "Uses jsii.create, jsii.invoke, and jsii.sinvoke for dynamic code execution within the provider class; no external data sources or network calls.",
  "flows": "Source data (parameters, environment info) flows into jsii functions which perform object creation and method calls; no external or untrusted data flows outside expected patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no backdoors, and no malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated implementation of a Terraform provider class using jsii, with proper type validation and typical methods for resource configuration and import. No external data sources, network activity, or system commands are present. The use of jsii functions is expected in cross-language bindings and does not indicate malicious intent. The code structure and logic are consistent with legitimate infrastructure-as-code tooling, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a Terraform provider class for the 'local' resource, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). The confidence in this assessment is high.",
