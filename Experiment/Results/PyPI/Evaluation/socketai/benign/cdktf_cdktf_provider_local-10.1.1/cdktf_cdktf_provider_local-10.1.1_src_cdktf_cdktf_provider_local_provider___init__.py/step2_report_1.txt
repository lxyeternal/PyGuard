  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard auto-generated Terraform provider class using jsii, with typical methods for configuration, import, and attribute synthesis.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or system commands are present.\n- The code employs type validation via `check_type` functions, which are safe and do not execute untrusted code.\n- The use of jsii functions (`jsii.create`, `jsii.invoke`, etc.) is expected in cross-language bindings; these can execute arbitrary code if misused, but in this context, they are part of a standard pattern.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- The code structure and logic are consistent with legitimate infrastructure-as-code tooling.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as a class for a Terraform provider, with configuration and import functions.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 (low), Confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign, and the low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar description, emphasizing potential dynamic execution via jsii.\n- **Findings:** Recognizes jsii's role but correctly states it is standard in such bindings. No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. The slightly higher risk score accounts for the dynamic nature of jsii, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Again, a standard provider class for CDKTF.\n- **Findings:** No external untrusted input, no network or system commands, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1, Confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The code is safe and standard.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, focusing on configuration and resource import.\n- **Findings:** No malicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0, Confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Describes the provider class, emphasizing no external data or malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1, Confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Valid. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking Scores and Logic:\n\n- All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, which is consistent with the code analysis.\n- The risk scores are very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concern, which is appropriate.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9–1.0), matching the thoroughness of the analysis.\n- The reasoning in all reports aligns with the code's actual content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code (auto-generated provider class, no external data or malicious patterns), a risk score of around **0.1** is reasonable, perhaps slightly higher if considering jsii's dynamic capabilities, but still low.\n\n**Proposed Final Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, legitimate implementation of a Terraform provider class using jsii, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and conclusions across the reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is safe and aligns with typical provider patterns.",
