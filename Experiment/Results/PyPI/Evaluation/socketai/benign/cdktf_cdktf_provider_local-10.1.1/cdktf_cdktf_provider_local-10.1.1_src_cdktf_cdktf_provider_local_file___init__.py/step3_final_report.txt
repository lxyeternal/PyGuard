{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for managing Terraform 'local_file' resources via CDKTF, including resource class, configuration data structures, and type validation.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, class properties, and type hints used during resource instantiation and configuration.",
  "sinks": "Resource creation via jsii calls, property setters, and validation functions; no external or malicious data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into internal configuration objects, then into jsii resource creation methods; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of version info for typeguard logic is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical infrastructure-as-code resource wrapper for Terraform local files, with standard class definitions, property accessors, and validation. No network activity, system modifications, or malicious behaviors are present. The code relies on well-known patterns and modules, and the type checking stubs are benign. No obfuscation or suspicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for managing Terraform local files within CDKTF. There are no signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious intent. The supply chain security risk is negligible.",
