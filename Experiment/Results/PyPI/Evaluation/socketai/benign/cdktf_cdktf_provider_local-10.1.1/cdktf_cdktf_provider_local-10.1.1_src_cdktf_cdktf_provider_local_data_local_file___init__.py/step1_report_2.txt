  "purpose": "Defines a Terraform data source for reading local file contents and associated configuration classes for use with CDKTF.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pkgutil', 'abc', 'builtins', 'datetime', 'enum', 'typing', 'jsii', 'publication', 'typing_extensions', 'typeguard', and internal modules. Usage of 'check_type' function for type validation. Class constructor reading configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data or network communication. The only input is the filename, which is used to read file contents.",
  "flows": "Input 'filename' is used within the class to read file contents via 'content', 'contentBase64', and checksum properties. No other data flows or network operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard type validation, class initialization, and property access. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is present. No malicious privacy violations or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a Terraform data source in Python using CDKTF, with type safety checks and property accessors. The 'check_type' function ensures correct types for constructor arguments. No network activity, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior is identified. The code appears to be a legitimate infrastructure management construct with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Terraform data source class definition for reading local file content, with standard patterns and no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It solely reads a file specified by 'filename' and exposes its content and checksums via properties.",
