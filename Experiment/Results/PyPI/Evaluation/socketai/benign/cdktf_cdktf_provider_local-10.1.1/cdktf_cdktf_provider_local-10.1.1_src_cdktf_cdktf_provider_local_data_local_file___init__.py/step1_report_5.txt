{
  "purpose": "Defines a Terraform data source for reading local file contents within the CDK for Terraform framework.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as 'filename' from function arguments and class properties.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs detected; no network connections, data leaks, or external calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'filename' flows into class properties; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. Uses standard libraries and clear class structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for Terraform data source integration, managing file reading operations with proper type checks. No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious code snippets. It performs standard property accessors and initializations aligned with CDKTF patterns. No network activity, file manipulations beyond reading the specified file, or external data transmissions are present. All methods and properties are for configuration and data retrieval only.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of a Terraform data source for local files within the CDK for Terraform framework. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malicious code detected.",
