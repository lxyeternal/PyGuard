{
  "purpose": "Defines a Terraform data source for reading local file content using CDK for Terraform.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (pkgutil, abc, builtins, datetime, enum, typing, jsii, publication, typing_extensions, typeguard, importlib.metadata, other internal modules). Reads input from constructor parameters such as 'filename'.",
  "sinks": "Returns file content and its hashes via class properties. Uses 'filename' to read files from the filesystem.",
  "flows": "Constructor takes 'filename' as input; 'content', 'contentBase64', and hash properties are accessed; these rely on reading the specified file content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no network activity, and no hidden behaviors. The code is mainly standard class and method definitions with type checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CDKTF data source class that reads a local file specified by 'filename'. It performs type checks in the constructor and property accessors. There are no suspicious or malicious functions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. The code uses standard imports and class structures without obfuscation. The purpose is to provide file content and hashes for Terraform configuration. No signs of malware or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a Terraform data source for reading local files, with no indicators of malicious behavior. It performs standard file content retrieval and hash calculation without side effects or malicious actions.",
