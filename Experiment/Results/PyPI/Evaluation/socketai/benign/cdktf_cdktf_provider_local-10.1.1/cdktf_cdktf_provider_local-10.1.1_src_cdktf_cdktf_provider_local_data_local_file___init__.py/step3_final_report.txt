  "purpose": "Defines a Terraform data source for reading local file contents, providing access to file content and associated hashes.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as 'filename' during instantiation; no external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "Provides file content and checksum properties; no data is transmitted externally or to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Uses 'filename' input to read file content and compute hashes; no external network or data flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard boilerplate class for Terraform CDK data source, with type checks and property accessors. No malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity is present. It solely reads local files as intended, with no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and serves a standard purpose in infrastructure as code. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
