  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a Terraform data source for local files, with no external data sources read.\n- **Flows & Sinks:** No untrusted data or network activity; primarily configuration parameters.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is a boilerplate class for CDKTF.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, no malicious intent, security risks minimal (0.1).\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code is standard, with no suspicious behavior. Malware score: 0.0. Risk score: 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines a Terraform data source, imports standard modules, uses type checking.\n- **Flows & Sinks:** Reads 'filename' to retrieve content, no external communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code is typical for CDKTF resource classes.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, no security risks, malware score: 0.0. Risk score: 0.0 or 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature. No malware, low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, for reading local files in CDKTF.\n- **Flows & Sinks:** Reads 'filename', no external data transmission.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard boilerplate code, malware score: 0.0, risk: 0.1 seems fine.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate. No malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Reads 'filename', standard class for Terraform data source.\n- **Flows & Sinks:** No external network activity, only local file reading.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, no malicious behavior, malware score: 0.0, risk: 0.0 or 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others, reading local files.\n- **Flows & Sinks:** No external data transmission, only file reading.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard implementation, malware score: 0.0, risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0.0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0.1, which is reasonable given the code's purpose (reading local files). The only potential reason to elevate risk is if the filename is supplied from untrusted sources, but that is outside the scope of static code review here.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- The code is standard boilerplate for Terraform CDK constructs, with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (consistent with minimal security concern for reading local files)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe and legitimate. No adjustments needed.",
