  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the details provided.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a Terraform data source class for reading local files, with no external data sources read.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data is written or sent; only configuration parameters are used.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code is standard CDKTF boilerplate.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully consistent with the code; no security risks or malware. The confidence score of 1.0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the class as a Terraform data source for local files, with standard imports and type checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transmission; only reading file content based on 'filename'.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code is standard for CDKTF resource definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate assessment; no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; the code is for reading local files via CDKTF.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code is typical boilerplate.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is consistent with the code; no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the class as a data source for local files, with standard imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transmission; only file reading based on 'filename'.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious patterns; standard class for configuration.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate; no malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; standard pattern for CDKTF data source.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. All behavior aligns with reading a local file.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Consistent with the code; no risks.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores at 0.0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores at 0.0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—reading local files with no network activity or data exfiltration—the overall security risk remains very low, around 0.1.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- The code is a standard, boilerplate implementation of a Terraform data source in CDKTF.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The detailed analysis confirms that the code is safe and legitimate.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting minimal configuration-related risk, not malicious)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. No further action or concern is necessary.",
