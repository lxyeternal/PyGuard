{
  "purpose": "Defines a Terraform data source for reading local file contents, with configuration and import capabilities.",
  "sources": "Reads input via constructor parameters (filename, connection, etc.). No external data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or dangerous data handling found; no untrusted data is written or sent over networks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to instantiate the class; no flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscated code, code injection, or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CDKTF (Cloud Development Kit for Terraform) class definition for managing a Terraform data source. It includes type checking, class setup, and property accessors. There is no network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration. The code relies on standard imports and generated type hints for configuration. No anomalies or malicious patterns are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, boilerplate class for Terraform CDK usage with no malicious intent. It reads configuration parameters for a local file data source and provides methods for resource import and attribute synthesis. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
