  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the validity of their conclusions, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a class representing a Terraform data source for local files, with no external data sources read.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected. It is a boilerplate class for CDKTF.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully legitimate, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0.0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0 — appropriate.  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 — very low, considering it's a standard class.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on reading local file contents, with type validation, no external data sources.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no malicious code. Standard CDKTF data source.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, safe, boilerplate code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0.0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0 — appropriate.  \n- Security Risk: 0.0 — aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar purpose, with detailed description of input parameters and code structure.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, no network activity. The code is standard for infrastructure as code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, safe, boilerplate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0.0 — suitable.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 — very low, consistent with standard code.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar description, emphasizing reading file content, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious behaviors, no obfuscation, standard property accessors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, safe.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0.0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Security Risk: 0 — aligns with the benign code.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, focusing on data flow and input parameters.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no external communication.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, standard implementation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0.0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 — very low, consistent with a standard data source.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe the same or very similar boilerplate classes for Terraform data sources, with no malicious logic or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, which is acceptable given the nature of the code as infrastructure configuration; it's low and not indicative of risk.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.** The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the code's role in infrastructure configuration, but no actual risk present)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions, confirming that the code is benign and standard for its purpose.",
