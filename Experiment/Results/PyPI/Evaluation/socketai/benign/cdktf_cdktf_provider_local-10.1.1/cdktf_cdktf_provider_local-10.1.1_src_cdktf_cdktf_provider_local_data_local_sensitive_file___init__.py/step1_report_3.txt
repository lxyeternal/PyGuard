{
  "purpose": "Defines a Terraform data source for reading sensitive file content, using CDKTF and jsii for integration.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as 'filename', optional 'connection', 'depends_on', 'provisioners', and provider configurations; imports several modules.",
  "sinks": "Returns file content and hash digests; no untrusted data sinks or network operations observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters like 'filename' are used to access file content, which is then exposed via properties. No data flows to external systems or network activities.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears to be standard for defining a Terraform data source with CDKTF. No obfuscation or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a class 'DataLocalSensitiveFile' for reading a file's content and hashes, with associated configuration data types. It includes type checks, class inheritance, and property getters. No code injection, network operations, or malicious data handling is present. The code structure follows standard patterns for infrastructure as code integrations. No signs of sabotage or malware functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard, benign implementation for reading a local sensitive file within a Terraform/CDKTF context. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely as an interface to read file content and associated hashes.",
