{
  "purpose": "This code defines a CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) data source class 'DataLocalSensitiveFile' that reads a specified local file and exposes its content along with various hash digests. Its purpose is to facilitate the retrieval of sensitive file data within Terraform-managed infrastructure.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'filename' parameter, which specifies the path to the file to be read.",
  "sinks": "The code exposes properties such as 'content', 'contentBase64', and hash digests, which could potentially leak sensitive data if misused, but this is inherent to its purpose as a data source.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'filename' input parameter to the file reading operations, then to the properties exposing file content and hashes; there are no external or network data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code is a standard generated class for infrastructure management.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, boilerplate implementation of a Terraform data source for reading local files. It includes type checking, configuration, import functionality, and property accessors for file content and hashes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation. The purpose is straightforward: read a file and expose its data and hashes. The security implications are minimal, primarily related to data exposure inherent to the data source purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and designed for infrastructure automation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain security issues are evident. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
