  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies that the code defines a CDKTF data source class for reading sensitive files.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** No external untrusted input handling; properties expose file content and hashes.\n- **Flows:** Straightforward data flow from 'filename' parameter to file reading and hash calculation.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard generated code, intended for infrastructure management, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (accurate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (accurate)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (low, given the nature of the code)\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, describes a Terraform data source for sensitive files.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Reads 'filename' input; exposes 'content' and hashes.\n- **Flows:** Data flows from user-controlled filename to file content and hash outputs.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard boilerplate code; no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (slightly higher but still low, considering exposure of sensitive data)\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious behavior; scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Same pattern: standard class for reading local files, no suspicious code.\n- No external network activity or obfuscation.\n- Properly designed for infrastructure as code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (minimal risk)\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Continues the pattern of a standard CDKTF data source.\n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Focused on exposing file content and hashes.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, confirms the code's purpose and structure.\n- No suspicious code or external communication.\n- Recognizes that exposing file content and hashes could leak sensitive data if misused, but this is inherent to the functionality.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (reasonable, given the exposure of sensitive data)\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently rate at 0, which aligns with the code's nature—it's a standard infrastructure data source, not malicious.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as the code is clear and boilerplate.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), reflecting the inherent risk of exposing sensitive file contents, but nothing indicating a security threat.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- The code is a standard, generated CDKTF construct for reading local sensitive files.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The exposure of file contents and hashes is expected and inherent to the data source purpose.\n- The risk scores are appropriate, considering the potential for sensitive data leakage if misused, but not indicative of an active security threat.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to account for potential data leakage if misused, but not a security breach)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and serves a legitimate purpose within Terraform/CDKTF. The scores assigned across reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.",
