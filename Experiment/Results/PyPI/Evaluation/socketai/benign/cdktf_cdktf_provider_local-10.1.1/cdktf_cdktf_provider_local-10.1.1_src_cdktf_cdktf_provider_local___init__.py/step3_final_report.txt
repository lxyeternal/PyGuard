  "purpose": "Package initialization, version management, type checking, and module registration for a Python SDK related to Terraform provider bindings.",
  "sources": "Module imports, version info retrieval, and internal function definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, external data flows, or network operations.",
  "flows": "Import statements and version-dependent typeguard logic, which are standard and benign.",
  "anomalies": "Use of version-dependent typeguard logic for compatibility, which is common and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package setup script that manages module imports, performs version checks, and registers submodules. It uses standard libraries and patterns without any external data handling, network activity, or code obfuscation. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data theft, or backdoors. The use of conditional typeguard checks is a compatibility measure, not an attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data, perform external commands, or contain obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
