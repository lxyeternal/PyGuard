  "purpose": "The code configures the setup parameters for a Python package using setuptools, primarily loading package metadata from a JSON string and reading a README file for long description.",
  "sources": "JSON string defining package metadata, and reading README.md file",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup function which utilizes the loaded metadata",
  "flows": "JSON data parsed into kwargs, then passed to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package metadata from a JSON string, reads a README.md for the long description, and calls setuptools.setup with the parameters. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network or file operations. The code is typical for Python package setup and does not include any suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
