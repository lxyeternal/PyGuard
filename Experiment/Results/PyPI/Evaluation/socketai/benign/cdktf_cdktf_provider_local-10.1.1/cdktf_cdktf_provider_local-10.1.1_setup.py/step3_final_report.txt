  "purpose": "Load package metadata from a static JSON string, read README.md for long description, and invoke setuptools.setup() to configure the package.",
  "sources": "json.loads() parsing static JSON string, open('README.md') reading local file",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() uses the loaded metadata for package installation",
  "flows": "json.loads() data -> kwargs -> setup() call; open() -> read() -> kwargs['long_description']",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; static data, no dynamic execution, no network activity, no secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package. It loads static metadata from a JSON string, reads a README file for description, and calls setuptools.setup() with the data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code does not handle untrusted input, secrets, or perform any network operations. All signals indicate a benign, standard package configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, standard for Python package setup, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting its safe and typical nature.",
