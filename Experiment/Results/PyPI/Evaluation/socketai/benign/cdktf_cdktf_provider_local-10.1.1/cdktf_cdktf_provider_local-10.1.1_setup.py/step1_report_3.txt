  "purpose": "This script is for setting up a Python package distribution, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and other related information.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the embedded JSON string and from the 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak if 'long_description' contains sensitive information; however, in typical use, this is just package metadata.",
  "flows": "JSON string data flows from 'json.loads' to 'kwargs'; 'long_description' flows from reading 'README.md' into 'kwargs' for setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'json' and 'setuptools' for package configuration. It loads package metadata from a static JSON string, then reads 'README.md' to include the long description. The setup function is called with the assembled metadata. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Usage of external files and dependencies is typical for Python package setup scripts. No signs of data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It correctly loads package info and dependencies without any suspicious or malicious modifications.",
