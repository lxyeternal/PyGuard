  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines a Terraform resource for managing sensitive files via CDKTF, reading configuration parameters and package metadata.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data sinks or flows that could cause harm; primarily configuration data passing into resource creation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic. Uses standard libraries and patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate resource class, no malware, low security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a standard resource definition with no malicious behavior. The malware score is appropriately 0. The confidence is high (0.9). No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on configuration reading.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into configuration, no network or system calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code; the code is typical for infrastructure configuration.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, low risk.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; malware score 0 is appropriate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, a resource class with configuration parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external system interactions; data flows into resource properties.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No backdoors or obfuscation; type stub functions are placeholders.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard boilerplate code, no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; malware score 0. The report's reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines a Terraform resource, reading configuration parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or system operations; data just assigned to resource attributes.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code; the code is typical for resource management.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior, low security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid; malware score 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar resource class with type checking.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Configuration parameters only; no external system interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious code; the type guard functions are version-dependent placeholders.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard boilerplate, no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; malware score 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard resource definition for managing sensitive files via CDKTF.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present.\n- The data flows are typical for infrastructure as code and do not involve untrusted external data execution or network activity.\n- The scores for malware are all 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports — consistent with the code's purpose.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — reflects typical configuration risks if user inputs are malicious, but no inherent vulnerabilities.\n\n**Note:** The code is primarily boilerplate for resource management, with no malicious intent or behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. The code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation, and minimal security risk.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo further action needed. The supply chain security posture for this dependency is sound based on the provided code.",
