{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Terraform resource class for managing sensitive files via CDKTF, handling parameters such as filename, content, source, and permissions, with type checking and resource configuration logic.",
  "sources": "Input parameters provided during class instantiation, such as filename, content, content_base64, source, and configuration options; package metadata for version checks.",
  "sinks": "Configuration data assigned to resource properties; no external system calls, network communication, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class properties and resource configuration via JSII invocations; no external data flows or malicious command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; placeholder type stub functions are standard boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard resource class for managing sensitive files in Terraform using CDKTF, with typical use of JSII and typeguard for type safety. No malicious logic, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The parameters involved are typical for resource configuration and do not indicate malicious intent. The code structure and flow are straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign resource class for managing sensitive files, with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity detected. The security risk is minimal and consistent with typical infrastructure as code modules.",
