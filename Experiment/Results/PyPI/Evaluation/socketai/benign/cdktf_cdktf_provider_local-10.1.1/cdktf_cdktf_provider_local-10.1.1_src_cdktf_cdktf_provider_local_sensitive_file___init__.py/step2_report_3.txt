  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's structure, data flows, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines a Terraform resource for managing sensitive files via CDKTF. It performs type checks, uses JSII for resource creation, and manages properties like filename, content, and source. No suspicious logic or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - **Malware:** Score 0 is appropriate. No malicious code detected.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** Score 0 is appropriate; code is straightforward.  \n  - **Risk:** Given it's a resource configuration module, the risk depends on user input. The code itself is not inherently risky, so 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on potential sinks in setting file content. The analysis states no network or malicious operations, just configuration handling.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - **Malware:** Score 0 is appropriate.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** Score 0, as code is standard.  \n  - **Risk:** Slightly higher at 0.0 or 0.2, but 0.2 remains reasonable considering user input could be malicious if misused, but the code itself is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is boilerplate for resource definition, with placeholder type stub functions. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 is correct.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0, as code is standard.  \n  - **Risk:** 0.2 is acceptable, reflecting that improper use of input parameters could lead to security issues, but the code itself is not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on configuration parameters and no malicious activity. The code is typical resource management code.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 is correct.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0, standard code.  \n  - **Risk:** 0.2 is appropriate, as misconfigured inputs could pose risks, but the code itself is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard resource class with type checking, no network or system modifications, and typical boilerplate. The only concern is handling untrusted input, which is inherent to resource configuration.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 is appropriate.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0, straightforward code.  \n  - **Risk:** 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, indicating no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 across reports is reasonable, reflecting that improper use of input parameters could pose security concerns, but the code itself is not malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with reports and code analysis)\n\n**Note:** The code is a typical infrastructure as code resource class, with no signs of supply chain attack, malware, or obfuscation. The primary concern is proper validation of user inputs when deploying, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---",
