  "purpose": "Import specific classes and functions from a local module named 'ppbtree', likely for tree data structure operations.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing 'Node', 'print_tree', and 'add' from the local module '.ppbtree'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing are visible; only import statements are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are detected in this import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a local module within the package. It imports specific functions and classes related to a tree structure. No input/output handling, network operations, or data processing occurs here. The import appears standard and safe. Since this is only an import statement, it does not provide enough context to identify malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious or malicious code is present in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement from a local module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on this fragment alone. It appears to be a benign component of a larger codebase.",
