  "purpose": "Importing specific functions and classes (Node, print_tree, add) from the local module 'ppbtree' to use in the current script.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from a local module file 'ppbtree.py'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or external communication is visible.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only performs a module import without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious code patterns are evident in this import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement, referencing a local module. It imports three components: Node, print_tree, and add. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. No external data, credentials, or communication is involved here. The code appears to be part of a larger project, and its security implications depend on the implementation of 'ppbtree', which is not provided.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign import statement without any malicious intent. It simply imports specific functions and classes from a local module, with no indications of security risks or malware. Overall, it appears safe based on the provided fragment.",
