{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions and classes (Node, print_tree, add) from a local module named ppbtree.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module '.ppbtree' during import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not handle user input or output directly.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing functions/classes from a local module; no data flow analysis is applicable here beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward import statement. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a standard import of specific components from a local module within the same package. It does not execute any untrusted code, contain obfuscation, or include suspicious behavior. The code itself is minimal and appears to be part of a larger project. Since it only imports symbols, there are no apparent security issues or malicious behavior evident at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports specific functions and classes from a local module, with no suspicious behavior or anomalies detected.",
