{
  "purpose": "Import specific classes and functions from the local module 'ppbtree' to utilize its data structures and methods.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module '.ppbtree'. No external data or user input is involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the import simply makes symbols available within the module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Node', 'print_tree', and 'add' from a local module '.ppbtree'. This is a standard practice in modular Python code. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident from this snippet. The import does not involve data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. The module 'ppbtree' could contain malicious code, but this cannot be determined solely from the import statement. The confidence in benignity is high, and there are no anomalies or signs of obfuscation. The malware score is 0, as there is no evidence of malicious intent. The security risk score is 0, reflecting the benign nature of an import statement. Overall, the code appears safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores are consistent with the minimal and safe nature of this code snippet.",
