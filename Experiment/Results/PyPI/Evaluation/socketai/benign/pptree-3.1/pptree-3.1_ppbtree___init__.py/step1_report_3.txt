  "purpose": "Import specific functions and classes (Node, print_tree, add) from the local module 'ppbtree'.",
  "sources": "Reading from the local module '.ppbtree'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks observed in this line.",
  "flows": "Import statement; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import (from .ppbtree) is typical in package code; no unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from a local module, which is common in Python projects. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The import statement itself does not pose a security risk or malicious intent. As this is only an import statement, it lacks further context to indicate malicious behavior. No anomalies or unusual constructs are detected in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement from a local module with no malicious behavior or security risks identified based on this fragment alone.",
