  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a standard Python setup script, defining package metadata with static values.\n- It uses 'distutils.core' instead of the more modern 'setuptools', which is deprecated but not malicious.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies static data; no malicious behavior; use of 'distutils.core' is noted.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score = 0; security risk = 0; confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; confirms static setup with no external input; outdated 'distutils.core' usage.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0; security risk = 0; confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0; security risk = 0; confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous; standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0; security risk = 0; confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; static parameters, no obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0; security risk = 0; confidence = 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly lower confidence but still consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-checking scores:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0 or very close, which is appropriate.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- **Use of 'distutils.core'** is deprecated but not malicious. It should be noted as outdated, but it doesn't affect security.\n- **No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or external data handling.**\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, static code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard package setup script with no security concerns.",
