  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a standard Python package setup script.\n- It uses 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools'—not malicious but outdated.\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static, with no dynamic or untrusted data handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security issues are present.\n- No network activity, secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code matches the description; it's a typical setup script.\n\n- **Malicious code, malware, obfuscation?**  \n  No. All reports agree on benignity, and the code shows no signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Use of 'distutils.core'?**  \n  Yes, noted as outdated but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring review:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware score:** All assign 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, appropriate given the static, non-interactive nature.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The only minor point is the use of 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools', which is outdated but not malicious. The reports correctly note this.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should all remain at 0.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, static nature of the script, with no malicious or obfuscating elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a straightforward, benign setup script with no security concerns. The scores should remain at zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk categories.",
