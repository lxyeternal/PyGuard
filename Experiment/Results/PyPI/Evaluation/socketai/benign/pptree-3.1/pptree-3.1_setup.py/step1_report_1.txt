  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'pptree' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function: name, packages, version, description, author, author_email, url, download_url, keywords, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "None; static configuration with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'distutils.core' instead of the more modern 'setuptools' (not malicious but notable), and no suspicious or unusual code behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script defining package metadata for distribution. It does not include any input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The static values appear typical for a Python package setup. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The use of 'distutils.core' is outdated but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup configuration with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
