  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'pptree' Python package, including package metadata and distribution info.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external system interaction that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; all parameters are static.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'distutils' instead of 'setuptools', which is deprecated but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script defining package metadata for distribution. It imports 'distutils.core' and calls 'setup' with static arguments such as package name, version, author info, URLs, and keywords. There are no dynamic data inputs, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious logic. Usage of deprecated 'distutils' instead of 'setuptools' is noted but does not indicate malicious intent. No signs of backdoors, malicious commands, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, serving only to define package distribution metadata. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
