  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the static nature of the code, the absence of dynamic or malicious behaviors, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with static metadata.\n- No untrusted input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is present.\n- The use of 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools' is outdated but not malicious.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or security risks are evident in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues found; the code matches the description.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Notes the outdated 'distutils.core' usage, which is correct but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0. These are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign setup script.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same conclusions as Report 1, consistent reasoning.\n- Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to previous reports; no issues.\n- Consistent scoring.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as above; no anomalies.\n- Scores appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still consistent.\n- No anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- Scores align with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is exactly as described—static setup configuration.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no dynamic or external code execution.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Use of deprecated modules:** Noted but not malicious.\n- **Risk scores:** All are zero or very low, which is appropriate given the benign analysis.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the static, benign code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since there's no security concern.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, benign setup script with no security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and should not be adjusted.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward package setup script.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity is present.\n- The scoring reflects the benign nature accurately.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; all scores are justified.",
