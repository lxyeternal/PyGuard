  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools', but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static setup script with no dynamic code, network activity, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of 'distutils.core' is outdated but not malicious. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate. The code's static, metadata-only nature indicates negligible security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate; no adjustments needed.",
