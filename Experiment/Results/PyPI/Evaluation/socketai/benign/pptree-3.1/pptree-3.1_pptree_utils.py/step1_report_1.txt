{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate and manipulate ASCII art diagrams, specifically for visualizing hierarchical structures or trees with connectors and branches.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of untrusted data are present; the code processes input parameters such as blocks (lists of strings) and joiners, which are internally defined or passed as arguments.",
  "sinks": "The functions manipulate string data and produce visual ASCII representations; no direct sinks such as network, file I/O, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (blocks, joiners) flow through functions to produce formatted ASCII diagrams. There are no external data flows to untrusted systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs are detected. The code primarily performs string manipulation for diagram rendering without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code imports only standard Python libraries (itertools), defines constants for ASCII diagram components, and implements functions to join blocks of strings, connect them with connectors, and generate branches for diagrams. The functions are designed for internal processing of text-based diagram components without external I/O, network, or system calls. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The purpose appears to be purely for rendering diagrams in a safe, controlled environment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign ASCII diagram generator with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, hardcoded credentials, or dangerous behaviors. The overall security risk is negligible.",
