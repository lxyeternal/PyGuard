{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate and manipulate textual tree-like structures for visualization or formatting purposes, such as connecting blocks of text with ASCII-style connectors.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters such as 'blocks' and 'joiners'. It processes list of strings provided as input arguments.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points where untrusted data could cause data leaks, code injection, or harmful effects. No use of eval, exec, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters ('blocks', 'joiners') through functions like 'multijoin', 'wire', 'branch', 'branch_left', 'branch_right', and 'connect_branches'. These functions process and combine string data but do not perform any external actions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior observed. It primarily manipulates strings for visualization purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several functions for constructing ASCII art or tree-like structures by joining blocks of text with specific connectors. The functions perform operations such as calculating maximum content widths, joining lines, and adding connector lines. No external system calls, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code is straightforward, with clear and documented string processing logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoor mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for generating text-based tree structures, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs string manipulation for formatting purposes only.",
