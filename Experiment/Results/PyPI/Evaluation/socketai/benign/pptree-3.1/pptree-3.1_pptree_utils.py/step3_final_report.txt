{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate ASCII diagrams, including joining blocks, wiring, branching, and connecting branches, for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as 'blocks' and 'joiners'; input strings within blocks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code manipulates only in-memory string data without external I/O.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input blocks through functions like multijoin, wire, branch, and connect_branches, producing formatted ASCII diagram strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of string manipulation functions for ASCII diagram generation, operating solely on passed-in data. It contains no external system calls, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The logic is clear, and no security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, visualization-only nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign ASCII diagram utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
