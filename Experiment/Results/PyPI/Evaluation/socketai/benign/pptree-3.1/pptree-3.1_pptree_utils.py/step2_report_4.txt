  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is designed solely for generating ASCII diagrams, involving string manipulations, joining blocks, wiring, and branching.\n- No external inputs are processed in an unsafe manner; inputs are function parameters, with no external data sources or untrusted data handling.\n- There are no system calls, network operations, file I/O, or dynamic code execution (e.g., eval, exec).\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The functions are straightforward, with clear logic for diagram construction.\n- The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious, such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoor behaviors.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior. Given the code's purpose and implementation, this seems accurate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports indicate no obfuscation, which aligns with the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign a very low or zero score, which is justified considering the code's benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n\n- The code, as presented, is safe and straightforward.\n- Since the code is purely for visualization, unless it is integrated into a larger system that processes untrusted data elsewhere, there is no security concern.\n- No vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are evident or implied.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The detailed analysis confirms that the code is benign.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (negligible security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The code is a safe utility for ASCII diagram visualization with no security concerns.",
