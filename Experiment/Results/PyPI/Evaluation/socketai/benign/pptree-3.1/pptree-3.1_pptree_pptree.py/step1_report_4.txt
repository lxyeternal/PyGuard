{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate and print a visual representation of a tree structure, either horizontally or vertically.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources directly; it operates on Node objects passed to the functions.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to the console via print statements; no sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the current_node parameter into recursive functions that process and display tree structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated code are present. The functions perform straightforward tree visualization without unusual or potentially malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script defines classes and functions for creating and printing tree structures with different layout options. It includes methods for calculating subtree sizes, balancing branches, and rendering the tree visually. The code relies on standard Python features, recursion, and string formatting. No external data sources, network connections, or data manipulation beyond display are observed. There are no signs of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign tree visualization utility with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to display tree structures and does not contain any harmful operations or security vulnerabilities.",
