  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the described code, reasoning, and scores, then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of functions and classes for constructing and visualizing tree structures in console output.\n- No external system calls, network activity, file I/O, or data exfiltration are present.\n- The code appears to be straightforward, with recursive functions, string formatting, and attribute access.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The utility functions imported from `.utils` are unspecified, but their usage seems standard for visualization.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and functional for its purpose.\n- **Security issues:** No vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or suspicious activities are evident.\n- **Malware or malicious intent:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and readable.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None based on the provided code.\n\n### Review of scores:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0` and `obfuscated: 0`, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are low (~0.1–0.2), which seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n- Confidence scores are high (0.9–1), appropriate given the clear and straightforward code.\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Risk scores > 0.5:** None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are consistent with the benign assessment.\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, justified by the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, justified by the code's clarity.\n- **Anomalies or assumptions:** The reports do not rely on assumptions; they logically analyze the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, my own evaluation is:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — Very low, reflecting the benign nature; no security risks identified.\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a visualization utility, with no external dependencies that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n- No suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The utility functions imported are unspecified but appear standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 | No malicious activity or code patterns detected.           |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 | Code is readable and straightforward.                       |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1               | Very low; no security issues identified.                   |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always monitor dependencies and utility functions (`.utils`) for potential vulnerabilities, but based on the provided code and reports, the overall security posture is benign.",
