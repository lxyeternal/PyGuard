{
  "purpose": "This code appears to implement functions for creating and printing tree structures, both horizontally and vertically, for visual representation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads class attributes ('name', 'children'), input parameters, and imported utility functions from '.utils'.",
  "sinks": "Uses print statements for output, which do not pose a security risk by themselves. No data sinks for untrusted data processing or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from node attribute retrieval (name, children) into functions that generate visual representations. No untrusted data is passed into external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The functions are purely for visualization; no obfuscated code, malicious logic, or external data transmission detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Node class for tree structure management and functions to print tree structures horizontally and vertically. It uses sorting and recursive calls for visualization. All operations are related to formatting and output; no external data manipulation, user input handling, or network activity. Utility functions are imported but their content is unknown; however, their usage appears standard. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a visualization utility for tree structures with no malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It is benign and purely for formatting output purposes.",
