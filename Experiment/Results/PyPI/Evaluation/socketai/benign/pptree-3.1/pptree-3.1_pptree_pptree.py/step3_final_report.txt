{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions for constructing and printing tree structures in horizontal and vertical formats, primarily for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads node attributes such as 'name' and 'children' to generate the tree structure; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects; the code only prints to standard output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from node attribute access through recursive functions to print statements, with no external system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and readable.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Node class with parent-child relationships and functions to print trees horizontally or vertically, utilizing recursion and attribute access. It performs no external system calls, network activity, or data handling beyond console output. The imported utilities are unspecified but appear standard. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscation or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for visualizing tree structures with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
