{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions to represent and visually print hierarchical tree structures in both horizontal and vertical formats.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes (name, parent, children), and input parameters for functions such as 'current_node', 'childattr', 'nameattr', and formatting options.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily performs data processing and printing; no sinks like network, file I/O, or system commands are evident. No untrusted data handling or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves input node attributes through functions that generate and format tree structures for display. No flow leads to external systems or sensitive data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard for tree visualization, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. It does not perform data exfiltration or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code imports utilities, defines a 'Node' class for tree structure with parent/child relationships, and contains functions for printing tree structures both horizontally and vertically. It uses recursive approaches for balanced branch splitting and formatted printing. No external system calls, network operations, or sensitive data handling are detected. The functions perform formatting and visualization solely in the console. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leaks. The code is well-structured, readable, and lacks suspicious patterns or obfuscated constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for visualizing hierarchical tree data structures with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for visualization purposes.",
