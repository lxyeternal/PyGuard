{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes and functions from a local module 'pptree', likely for use in tree data structure operations or visualization.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is the source; it reads the module 'pptree' from the local package directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data, perform network communication, or execute dynamic code.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing 'Node' and 'print_tree' from 'pptree' without further data or control flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard Python import statement importing 'Node' and 'print_tree' from a local module 'pptree'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The import is static, with no dynamic execution, data handling, or network activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. No further analysis or action is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The current scores are justified and should be maintained.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
