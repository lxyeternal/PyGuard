{
  "purpose": "This code imports two components, 'Node' and 'print_tree', from a module named '.pptree', likely used for constructing and displaying tree structures.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which reads the module '.pptree' from the current package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code snippet, as it does not process any data or perform operations beyond import.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this snippet; it solely performs an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and appears straightforward. The import path '.pptree' indicates a relative import, which is typical in Python packages. No unusual or suspicious code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports components from a local module named 'pptree'. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no evident malicious behavior. The simplicity and standard import pattern suggest no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard import statement for a local module, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
