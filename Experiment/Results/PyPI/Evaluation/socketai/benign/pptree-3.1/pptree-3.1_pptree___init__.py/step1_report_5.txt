  "purpose": "The code imports two components, Node and print_tree, from a local module named pptree, likely for constructing and displaying tree structures.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the pptree module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward import statement with no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific components from a local module. There is no input handling, no execution of dynamic code, and no data leaks or malicious behavior observed. The structure is simple and typical for modular Python code.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports components from a local module for tree operations.",
