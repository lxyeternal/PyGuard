  "purpose": "Import classes and functions from a local module named 'pptree' for tree structure operations.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing from a relative module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or potential data leak points identified.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is an import statement and does not process data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing 'Node' and 'print_tree' from a local module 'pptree'. There are no input operations, data processing, or network activities. The import appears to be standard Python code used to access functionalities defined elsewhere in the package. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement for local module components, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
