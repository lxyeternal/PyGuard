{
  "purpose": "This code implements a binary search tree with functions to add nodes and print the tree structure.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'add' function parameter (values to insert), and the 'randint' function generating random numbers for node values.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the tree structure to the console via print statements; no data is sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input values generated by 'randint' are added to the tree through 'add'; 'print_tree' outputs the tree structure to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation. Use of random number generation appears benign in context.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs and visualizes a binary search tree with random values. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are used beyond random number generation. The print function is used solely for visualization and does not involve any data exfiltration or malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious intent are apparent. The code operates within expected parameters for a tree visualization script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a binary search tree with visualization; no malicious behavior, supply chain security issues, or security risks are identified. It appears safe for use.",
