{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple binary tree structure with functions to add nodes and print the tree in a visual format.",
  "sources": "Data sources include user input through the random number generator (randint) in the main block, and the 'current_node' parameter in print_tree.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the tree structure via print statements. No data sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input data (random integers) are added to the tree via 'add'. The 'print_tree' function reads node attributes to generate a visual representation. Data flows from data generation to tree insertion, then to console output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. The code uses standard Python features and libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a binary search tree with randomly generated integers and prints its structure. The use of 'randint' from the standard library is typical for testing or demonstration purposes. The print_tree function is a recursive visualization tool. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior such as network communication, file modifications, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign implementation of a binary tree with visualization. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this code. It functions solely for data structure demonstration and visualization.",
