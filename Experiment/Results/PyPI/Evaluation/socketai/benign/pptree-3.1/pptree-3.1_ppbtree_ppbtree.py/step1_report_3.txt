{
  "purpose": "The code implements a binary search tree with functions to add nodes and print the tree structure.",
  "sources": "Data is generated internally via the 'randint' function; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to standard output using print statements; no data is sent over network or written to files.",
  "flows": "N/A, as data is generated internally and only printed; no untrusted data flows or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code appears straightforward, with no malicious backdoors or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a simple binary search tree structure with add and print functionalities. It uses the standard 'randint' to generate random node values between 10 and 99, and prints the tree structure to console. There are no external data inputs, no network activity, nor any code that manipulates files or environment variables. The code appears to be a benign data structure implementation with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a binary search tree used for demonstration or educational purposes. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks within this code. It only generates and displays a tree structure locally without any external dependencies or suspicious activity.",
