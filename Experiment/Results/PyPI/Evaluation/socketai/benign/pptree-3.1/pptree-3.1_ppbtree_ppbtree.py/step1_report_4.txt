{
  "purpose": "The code constructs and prints a binary tree data structure with random integer values, primarily for visualization or educational purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads random integer values generated by `randint(10, 99)` in the main block.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sinks present; output is printed to the console. No data leaks or external system interactions are detected.",
  "flows": "Random values generated are added to the tree structure; no flow leads to external systems or untrusted data processing beyond local memory.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The code is straightforward and intended for visualization.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a binary search tree with random values, then visualizes it. No external inputs other than the random number generator are used, which is standard. The functions are for building and printing the tree, with no malicious operations or data exfiltration. The code does not connect to networks, execute dynamic code, or access sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of binary tree construction and visualization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It solely performs local memory operations and outputs to the console.",
