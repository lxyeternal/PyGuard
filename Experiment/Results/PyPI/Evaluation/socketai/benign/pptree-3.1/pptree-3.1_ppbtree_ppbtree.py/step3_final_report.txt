{
  "purpose": "The code constructs and visualizes a binary search tree using randomly generated integers, primarily for demonstration or educational purposes.",
  "sources": "Random integer generation via 'randint' in the main block.",
  "sinks": "Console output through print statements.",
  "flows": "Random integers are added to the tree via 'add', then the structure is printed by 'print_tree'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard binary search tree with visualization, using straightforward Python constructs. It reads data from the 'randint' function, which is benign, and outputs the structure to the console. No external data sources, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code is simple, clear, and lacks any obfuscation or malicious payloads. All functions perform as expected without side effects or vulnerabilities. Given the absence of suspicious activity, malicious intent, or security flaws, the code is considered safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign educational or demonstration script implementing a binary search tree with visualization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
