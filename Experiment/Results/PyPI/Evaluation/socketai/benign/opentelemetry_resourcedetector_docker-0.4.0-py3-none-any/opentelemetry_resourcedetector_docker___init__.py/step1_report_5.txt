  "purpose": "Detects Docker container environment and extracts container ID for OpenTelemetry resource attributes.",
  "sources": "Reads from system files '/proc/self/mountinfo' and '/proc/self/cgroup' to gather container environment information.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not send data over the network or write to external systems.",
  "flows": "Reads system files -> Parses container info -> Returns container ID if detected -> Constructs resource attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Uses system file reads for environment detection; no suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reliably detects Docker container environments by inspecting system files, employing regex matching for container IDs. It includes caching for efficiency. No external network activity, credential handling, or obfuscation is present. The purpose aligns with environment detection, not malicious intent. No anomalies or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs environment detection for Docker containers without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility component for OpenTelemetry resource configuration.",
