  "purpose": "Detects whether the current environment is a Docker container by reading system files and extracting container ID attributes.",
  "sources": "Reads from '/proc/self/mountinfo' and '/proc/self/cgroup' to gather environment data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data transmission; reads system files only for environment detection.",
  "flows": "Reads system files -> applies regex matching -> returns container ID or raises exception -> sets resource attributes if in Docker.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward regex matching and standard file reading; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Docker environment detection by parsing system files with regex. It caches results for efficiency, raises exceptions if not in Docker, and constructs resource attributes accordingly. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or data exfiltration is present. The logic is correct, and the code is clear and well-structured. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent Docker environment detector with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores are accurate; only a minimal security risk score is justified due to system file reads, which are standard for container detection. No adjustments are necessary.",
