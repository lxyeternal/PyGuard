{
  "purpose": "Detects Docker container environment and retrieves container ID for OpenTelemetry resource attributes.",
  "sources": "Reads from system files '/proc/self/mountinfo' and '/proc/self/cgroup' to identify Docker container ID.",
  "targets": "Uses regex matching on system file lines to extract container ID; no direct untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads system files to find container ID, then outputs resource attributes; no external network or system modifications observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. Use of system files and regex is standard for container detection.",
  "analysis": "The code performs container detection by reading system files and parsing their contents with regex. No suspicious or malicious operations are present; all functions are used for environment detection. No external network activity or data exfiltration observed. The code is structured and straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign container environment detection utility for OpenTelemetry. It accesses system files to determine Docker container presence and ID, with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful actions.",
