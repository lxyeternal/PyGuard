{
  "purpose": "Detects if the current environment is running inside a Docker container and retrieves Docker container ID and runtime information for OpenTelemetry resource attribution.",
  "sources": "Reads from system files '/proc/self/mountinfo' and '/proc/self/cgroup' to determine container environment and container ID.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code only reads system files and sets resource attributes; no data is written to external systems or used in potentially harmful operations.",
  "flows": "Reads system files -> parses container ID -> sets resource attributes if inside Docker.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard system file access to detect container environment; no suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors; no unusual dynamic code execution or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code reads system files '/proc/self/mountinfo' and '/proc/self/cgroup' to identify Docker container environment and container ID, using regex pattern matching. It employs caching for efficiency and raises an exception if not in Docker. No external data or network operations are performed, and there are no signs of malicious intent. The code is straightforward, focused on environment detection with standard Python features.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate environment detection for Docker containers and sets related resource attributes for OpenTelemetry. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and purposeful within its scope.",
