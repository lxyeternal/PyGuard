  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code reads from `/proc/self/mountinfo` and `/proc/self/cgroup`.\n- They all conclude the code is straightforward, benign, and performs environment detection.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the code's limited scope and lack of external data transmission or secret handling.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), indicating strong agreement that the code is safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n**Code correctness:**\n- The regex patterns for container ID extraction are standard and appropriate.\n- The code caches the results for efficiency.\n- It raises `NotInDocker` if container ID is not found, which is handled in `running_in_docker()`.\n- The `detect()` method correctly returns an empty resource if not in Docker, otherwise sets attributes.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- No evident errors or flaws in logic.\n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- No external network or file write operations.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n\n**Malware Score:**\n- All reports agree on 0.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity; it only reads system files and sets resource attributes.\n- **No change needed.**\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n- All reports indicate 0.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **No change needed.**\n\n**Risk Score:**\n- The scores are very low (0.1 to 0.2), which seems appropriate given the code's purpose.\n- The only minor concern could be the reliance on system files, but this is standard for container detection.\n- Since no external data or network activity is involved, a risk score of 0.1-0.2 is justified.\n- **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** ~0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as a benign environment detection utility.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are warranted.\n- The code's purpose is clear, safe, and standard for container environment detection.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and well-founded. The scores are appropriate, and the code does not exhibit malicious or obfuscated behavior. The risk remains minimal, and the detection logic is sound.\n\n**My final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or slightly above, but still very low)\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the code's actual behavior.",
