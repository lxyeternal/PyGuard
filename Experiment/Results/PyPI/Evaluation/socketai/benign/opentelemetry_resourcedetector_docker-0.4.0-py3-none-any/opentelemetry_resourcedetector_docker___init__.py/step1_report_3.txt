  "purpose": "Detects OpenTelemetry resource attributes for Docker containers by reading system files to identify container ID and runtime environment.",
  "sources": "Reads from system files: '/proc/self/mountinfo' and '/proc/self/cgroup'.",
  "kills": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmissions observed.",
  "flows": "Reads system files (sources) to determine container ID and Docker environment, then constructs Resource object with this data (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to parse system files for container IDs; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code reads from well-known system files to detect container environment, using regex patterns to extract container IDs. It employs caching for efficiency. No external network, no credential handling, and no suspicious behaviors identified. It performs environment detection solely based on system file content. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate environment detection utility for Docker containers. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. It performs its function safely within expected bounds.",
