  "purpose": "Detects Docker container environment and extracts container ID for OpenTelemetry resource attributes.",
  "sources": "Reads files '/proc/self/mountinfo' and '/proc/self/cgroup' to gather system information about container environment.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data leads to security vulnerabilities; no data is transmitted or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Reads system files -> parses content with regex -> determines container ID -> reports resource attributes if in Docker.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Usage of system files is typical for container detection. No suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for detecting if the process runs inside a Docker container by reading system files. Uses regex to parse container IDs from mounted files, which is standard. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, and no code injection or malicious logic. No obfuscation, cryptic variables, or hidden behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate for environment detection and resource attribute extraction in containerized setups. No signs of malicious behavior or malware. The code is safe and adheres to expected functionality for container detection.",
