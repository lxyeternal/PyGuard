{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors from the IonQ API, including HTTP status codes and specific job or serializer errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from constructor parameters such as message, status_code, job_id, and status.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages and attributes store error details; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into exception messages and attributes; no external data or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior; the code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'requests' solely to access 'requests.codes.not_found' for setting a standard HTTP status code. It defines several custom exceptions inheriting from Exception, with constructors that set message strings and attributes. There are no network requests, data leaks, or external data processing. The code is clean, well-structured, and standard for API error handling. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of 'requests.codes.not_found' is safe and common practice. The exception classes serve their purpose without side effects or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exceptions for API error handling. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The supply chain security risk is negligible, and the scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
