{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling errors from the IonQ API, including connection issues, resource not found, job failures, and serializer errors.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'requests' library, specifically uses 'requests.codes.not_found' for HTTP status code references.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'requests.codes.not_found' for error handling; no untrusted data input or output.",
  "flows": "Exception initializations and messages do not involve untrusted data flows or external input/output beyond standard library and requests library references.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior. The code solely defines exception classes with standard error message formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions related to an API client. It leverages Python's exception hierarchy and references the 'requests' library for HTTP status codes. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data leakage, or malicious activity. The code does not process external input or contain obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, well-structured exception handling for an API client. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not pose any security risks.",
