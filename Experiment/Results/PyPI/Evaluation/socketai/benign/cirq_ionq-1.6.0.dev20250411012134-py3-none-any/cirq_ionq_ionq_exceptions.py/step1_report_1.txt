{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to IonQ's API interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'requests' library and uses it to set status codes in exception classes.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'requests.codes.not_found' to assign a status code in IonQNotFoundException.",
  "flows": "Exception initialization may access 'requests.codes.not_found' to assign status codes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines exception classes inheriting from 'Exception', with some use of the 'requests' library for setting standard HTTP status codes. There are no data flows involving untrusted input, nor code that performs network requests or data processing. The usage of 'requests.codes.not_found' is standard for HTTP status management. No obfuscated code, malicious functions, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for API error handling, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
