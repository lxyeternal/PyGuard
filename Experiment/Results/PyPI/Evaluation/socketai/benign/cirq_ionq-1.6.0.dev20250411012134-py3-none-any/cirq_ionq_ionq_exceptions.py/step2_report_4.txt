  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code defines exception classes without any suspicious behavior.  \n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?** No. The implementation is straightforward and standard.  \n- **Scores:** All scores (malware, obfuscated, risk) are 0, which seems appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security concern here.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to Report 1, it's standard exception class definitions.  \n- **Errors, flaws?** No.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, matching the content.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe and standard.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Same as above, no malicious or suspicious activity.  \n- **Errors, flaws?** No.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security risk.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code is simple exception class definitions.  \n- **Errors, flaws?** No.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, fitting the context.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Consistent with previous reports, just exception classes.  \n- **Errors, flaws?** No.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code content:** All reports describe the same pattern: defining custom exception classes for API error handling, with no network requests, data processing, or external input handling beyond standard exception message formatting.  \n- **Malware risk:** None detected; no malicious code, no suspicious behavior, no obfuscated logic.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None present.  \n- **Security risk:** None; these are standard exception classes.\n\n### Final scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since it's a basic, safe code, but to be conservative, we might keep it at 0.1 for completeness in supply chain risk, though it's negligible).\n\n**Note:** The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the actual code content. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, safe implementation of custom exceptions for API error handling. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The supply chain risk is negligible.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or 0 if strict)  \n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is secure and free of malicious intent.",
