  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports describe the same code: a set of custom exception classes for handling errors related to IonQ's API.\n- The code imports the 'requests' library solely to access 'requests.codes.not_found' for setting HTTP status codes.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, with no data processing, network calls, or external input handling beyond constructor parameters.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n- The code appears to be a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions for API error handling.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. It is a clean, minimal implementation.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** None identified. The use of 'requests.codes.not_found' is appropriate and standard.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware: 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n  - Security risk: 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious activities are present.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, no obfuscation detected.\n  - Confidence: 1, high confidence that the code is safe.\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- **Consistency of scores:** The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n\n- The only minor point is the import of 'requests' solely for a constant, which is common practice. No issues there.\n- The code's purpose is solely to define exception classes, with no network or data processing involved.\n\n**My assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions for API error handling, with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0              |\n| Security Risk  | 0              |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
