  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling errors related to the IonQ API interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports 'requests' library and standard Python modules; uses input parameters in exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages may include input data such as 'message', 'job_id', and 'status'.",
  "flows": "Input data from parameters flows into exception message strings, which are then raised and possibly displayed or logged.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation or malicious constructs. Use of standard exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception, incorporating optional or required data for error context. It uses the 'requests' library to get HTTP status codes for specific exceptions. No untrusted input is directly processed beyond being included in exception messages. No network calls, system modifications, or data leaks are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for API error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical exception class implementation for API error handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
