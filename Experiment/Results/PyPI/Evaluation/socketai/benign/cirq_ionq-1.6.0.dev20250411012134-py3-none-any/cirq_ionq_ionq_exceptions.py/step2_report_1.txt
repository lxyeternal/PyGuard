  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a set of custom exception classes for handling errors from the IonQ API.\n- The code imports 'requests' solely to access 'requests.codes.not_found' for standard HTTP status codes.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, inheriting from Python's Exception, with no data processing, network activity, or external data handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exceptions.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The use of 'requests.codes.not_found' is standard and safe.\n- No untrusted input processing, data leaks, or external code execution.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- None identified. The code appears correct, well-structured, and appropriate for its purpose.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correct as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very close to it, since the code is purely for exception handling with no security implications.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is standard.\n- The use of 'requests.codes.not_found' is correct and does not introduce security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nBased on the provided code and reports, **the supply chain security risk is negligible**. The code is a standard, safe implementation of exception classes for API error handling.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the reports correctly identify it as such. No further action or concern is necessary.",
