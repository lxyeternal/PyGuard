  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines custom exception classes for handling errors related to the IonQ API.\n- It imports the 'requests' library solely to access 'requests.codes.not_found' for setting HTTP status code attributes.\n- The classes are straightforward, inheriting from Python's Exception, with some storing additional context (like status codes, job IDs, messages).\n- No network requests, data processing, or external data handling occurs within these classes.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code appears correct and free of bugs or security issues.\n- The use of 'requests.codes.not_found' is standard and safe.\n- No data flows involve untrusted input beyond parameters used for exception messages, which is acceptable.\n- No network calls, external code execution, or data leaks are present.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- None detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured for its purpose.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. The code contains no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk score:** 0, no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- All reports assign a **malware score of 0**, which is appropriate.\n- The **security risk score of 0** is justified given the nature of the code.\n- The **obfuscated score of 0** is correct; the code is transparent.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- Some reports mention the use of 'requests' library and the inclusion of parameters in exception messages, which is standard practice.\n- No claims are made about the code performing any network operations or data handling beyond exception class definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for an API client.\n- It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and justified.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall, the supply chain security risk for this code is negligible.**",
