{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to the IonQ API in a Python application.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data beyond importing modules and defining classes.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains untrusted data sinks; exceptions are raised based on internal logic or parameters.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as the code solely defines exception classes and constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. Usage of requests.codes.not_found is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'requests' library but only utilizes 'requests.codes.not_found' within an exception constructor, which is a normal, safe pattern. The exception classes extend Python's Exception and include optional attributes or parameters for error details. There are no data processing, input handling, or network operations that could pose security risks. The code is straightforward and intended for error handling; no malicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code defines custom exception classes for handling API errors, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe implementation for error handling in a Python package.",
