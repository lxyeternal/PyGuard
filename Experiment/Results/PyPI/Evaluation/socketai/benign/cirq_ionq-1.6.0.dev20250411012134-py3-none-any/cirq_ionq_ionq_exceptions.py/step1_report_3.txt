{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling errors related to IonQ's API interactions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the class constructors and the 'requests.codes.not_found' constant.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "The code flows from instantiation of exception objects to raising exceptions with messages or attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code structures are present. Usage of 'requests.codes.not_found' is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for custom exceptions, extending Python's built-in Exception class. It imports the 'requests' library solely for accessing HTTP status codes. The exception classes store relevant information, such as status codes and messages, and format error messages accordingly. There are no input/output sources, no data processing, no external code execution, and no suspicious behavior or data leaks. The code is straightforward, focused on error handling, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, no malicious code, and no security risks. It is safe for use and does not pose any supply chain security threats.",
