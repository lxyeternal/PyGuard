  "purpose": "Set an environment variable 'CIRQ_TESTING' to 'true' during pytest configuration to signal testing mode.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it simply assigns an environment variable within a function.",
  "sinks": "The environment variable is set locally; no untrusted data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code only assigns an environment variable without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, setting a testing flag with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' and defines a pytest configuration function that sets an environment variable 'CIRQ_TESTING' to 'true'. It is a standard pattern for signaling test mode. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code's purpose is benign, intended solely for test configuration. The environment variable setting is common practice and does not pose security risks. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, straightforward setup snippet with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign test configuration snippet that sets an environment variable to signal testing mode. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's function.",
