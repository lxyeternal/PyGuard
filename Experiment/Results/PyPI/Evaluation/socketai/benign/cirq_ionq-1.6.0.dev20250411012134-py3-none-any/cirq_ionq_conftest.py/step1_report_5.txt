{
  "purpose": "Set an environment variable 'CIRQ_TESTING' to 'true' during pytest configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only sets an environment variable within the code execution context.",
  "sinks": "The environment variable is set locally; no untrusted data is involved and no external sinks are used.",
  "flows": "No external data flow is involved; the code simply assigns a value to an environment variable.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward and typical for test configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module and defines a function 'pytest_configure' that sets an environment variable. This appears to be standard practice in test setups to enable testing modes. No hardcoded secrets, malicious commands, or suspicious logic are present. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoor functions. The only action is setting an environment variable for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for test configuration, and does not contain malicious behavior. It does not pose any security risks.",
