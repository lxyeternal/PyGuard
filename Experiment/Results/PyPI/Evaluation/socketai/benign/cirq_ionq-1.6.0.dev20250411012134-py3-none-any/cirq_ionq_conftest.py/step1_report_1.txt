  "purpose": "Set an environment variable 'CIRQ_TESTING' to 'true' during pytest configuration.",
  "sources": "os.environ['CIRQ_TESTING'] = \"true\"",
  "sinks": "Environment variable modification (os.environ)",
  "flows": "Code execution sets environment variable 'CIRQ_TESTING' to 'true' which could influence behavior of other parts of the system or tests",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard environment variable setting in testing context",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and defines a function pytest_configure that sets an environment variable 'CIRQ_TESTING' to 'true'. This is a typical pattern in testing to signal testing mode. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and intended for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply sets an environment variable during pytest configuration to indicate testing mode. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks present.",
