{
  "purpose": "The code imports version information and camera-related classes and functions, likely for a camera handling or processing library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the '_version' module and the 'camera' module, specifically importing __version__, Camera, PixelFormat, Backend, and register_backend.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak data or execute malicious operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only performs static imports without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with straightforward imports; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for version info and camera-related classes/functions. It does not include data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module import setup for a camera-related package. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
