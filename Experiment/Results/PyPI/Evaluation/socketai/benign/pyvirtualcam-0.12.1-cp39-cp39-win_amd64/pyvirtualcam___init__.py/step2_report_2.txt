  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Import version info and camera functions/classes.\n- Source: Local modules (_version, camera).\n- Data flow: None; static imports.\n- Anomalies: None observed.\n- Conclusion: Standard module import; no malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is straightforward, importing from local modules. No external data, network, or suspicious patterns. The report's conclusion is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Import version info and camera components.\n- Source: Internal modules.\n- Data flow: None; static imports.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: Standard setup.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The report's conclusion holds.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Import version info and camera classes/functions.\n- Source: Local modules.\n- Data flow: None.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous reports. No issues identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Import version info and camera components.\n- Source: Modules _version and camera.\n- Data flow: None.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: Simple import setup.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Import version info and camera classes/functions.\n- Source: Modules _version and camera.\n- Data flow: None.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: Standard import.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo issues.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:**  \n  The code snippets are minimal import statements from internal modules. They do not perform any data processing, network communication, or execute any code beyond static imports. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security flaws.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Reports:**  \n  The reports uniformly conclude no malicious activity or security concerns, which aligns with the code's simplicity. No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n- **Scores and Justifications:**  \n  All reports assign scores of 0.0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is appropriate given the code. The confidence levels are high (1.0), which is justified.\n\n- **Malware and Risk Scores:**  \n  Since there's no evidence of malicious behavior, malware score should remain at 0.0. The obfuscated score is also correctly at 0.0, as the code is clear and straightforward. The overall security risk is zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard set of import statements for internal modules, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. All reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nAlways consider the context of the entire package. While this snippet appears benign, comprehensive security assessment should include the contents of `_version.py` and `camera.py`. However, based solely on the provided code, there are no concerns.",
