  "purpose": "Import modules and components related to versioning and camera functionalities for a larger package.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading from internal modules: ._version and .camera",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static imports without runtime data handling",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious constructs, or unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information from a local module and camera-related classes and functions from another local module. It appears to be part of a package's internal structure setup, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external communication. The code is straightforward, with standard import statements typical in Python packages, and does not involve any obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import setup for a Python package's internal modules, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
