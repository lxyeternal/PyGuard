  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The code only imports `__version__` from `_version` and camera classes/functions from `camera`.\n- No data flows, external communication, or suspicious code.\n- No anomalies or malware indicators.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies this as standard import statements with no security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0. These are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on internal module imports.\n- No data leaks, external communication, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; this is typical package setup code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates that the code only imports version info and camera components.\n- No input/output, external data handling, or malicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: import statements for version and camera modules.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Valid; standard package imports.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also only imports version info and camera classes/functions.\n- No data flows, external communication, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings.\n- **Scores:** Zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- All reports describe identical or very similar code snippets: simple import statements from internal modules.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (all zeros) are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is straightforward, standard for Python packages.\n- No external data handling, no network activity, no code execution, no obfuscation.\n- Malware score should remain at 0.0.\n- Obfuscated code score should be 0.0.\n- Risk score should be 0.0, as there is no indication of any security concern.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Security risk:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. No modifications needed.",
