{
  "purpose": "This code imports version information and camera-related classes and functions, likely for a library that manages camera devices.",
  "sources": "Import from ._version and .camera modules, which may read version info and camera configurations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or could leak; no network, file, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable; the code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns are present; no obfuscation or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements from local modules, suggesting it is part of a larger package. It imports version info and camera interface components. No input/output, data processing, or potentially harmful behavior is observed. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement setup for a camera-related library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
