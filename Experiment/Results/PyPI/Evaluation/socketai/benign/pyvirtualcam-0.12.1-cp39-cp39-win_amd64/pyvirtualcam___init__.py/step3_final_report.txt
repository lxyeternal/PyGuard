{
  "purpose": "The code imports version information and camera-related classes/functions from internal modules, likely for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Internal modules '_version' and 'camera' from which data is imported.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows are present; static imports only.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; only static import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, with no runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. All signs point to standard package setup code. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet, the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores are correct and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
