  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external data flows are present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; simply importing modules and functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info and camera functionalities from local modules. No external network communication, data leakage, or suspicious code activities are evident. The structure is typical for a Python package's init or main module, and there are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module import statement with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
