{
  "purpose": "The code defines a cross-platform framework for managing virtual camera backends, handling resource management, frame validation, and platform-specific backend registration.",
  "sources": "User-provided numpy ndarray frames, system modules for platform detection, imported backend modules.",
  "sinks": "Frames passed to backend.send(), no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input frames from user -> validation -> backend.send() -> hardware interface.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages hardware resources, validates frame shape and dtype, performs platform-specific backend registration, and handles fps measurement. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious operations are present. Exception handling during backend initialization is standard. The code's purpose is hardware abstraction and resource management, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, platform-aware virtual camera interface with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscated score is 0, indicating clear, readable code. The overall security risk score is 0.1, reflecting the minimal potential for platform-specific misuse but no inherent vulnerabilities.",
