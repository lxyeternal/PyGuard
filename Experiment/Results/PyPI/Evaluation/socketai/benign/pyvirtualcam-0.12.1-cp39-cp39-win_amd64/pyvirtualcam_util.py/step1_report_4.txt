  "purpose": "This code provides a utility for measuring frames per second (FPS) and encoding/decoding four-character codes (FourCC).",
  "sources": "time.perf_counter() for measuring time, function parameters (e.g., s: str) for input.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external effects; no data output or external system interactions observed.",
  "flows": "time.perf_counter() reads system time; encode_fourcc() converts string to integer; decode_fourcc() converts integer back to string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic are present. Functions are straightforward; no obfuscation or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The FPSCounter class calculates average FPS based on high-resolution timing, using standard methods. encode_fourcc and decode_fourcc handle character encoding conversions with basic bitwise operations. No external or network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of sensitive data or environment variables. The code appears to be utility functions with legitimate purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs benign utility functions related to timing and encoding. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears safe and straightforward.",
