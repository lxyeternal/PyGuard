{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and a class for measuring frames per second (FPS) and encoding/decoding FourCC codes, likely for multimedia or graphics applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time via time.perf_counter() and accepts a string input for encoding.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present. The encode_fourcc function raises an error if input is invalid, but does not execute untrusted code or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Input string -> encode_fourcc or decode_fourcc functions; system time -> measure() method updates internal state.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code uses standard Python functions and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The FPSCounter class utilizes system timing to calculate average frame rate, with typical implementation. The encode_fourcc and decode_fourcc functions handle 4-character string encoding/decoding to integers, common in multimedia processing. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior detected. No external network, file access, or environment variable misuse present. The code appears benign, with standard utility functions relevant to graphics/video processing.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, implementing typical utility functions and a frame rate counter without any malicious intent or security risks. No anomalies, malware, or security concerns identified.",
