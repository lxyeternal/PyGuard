  "purpose": "Provide utilities for FPS measurement and four-character code encoding/decoding.",
  "sources": "time.perf_counter() for timing; input string 's' in encode_fourcc.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "Input string for encode_fourcc flows into bitwise operations; timing data flows into calculations for FPS.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The functions perform standard operations.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a class for measuring frames per second using high-resolution timers, which appears straightforward and does not involve untrusted input aside from internal timing data. The encode_fourcc function converts a 4-character string into an integer using ordinal conversions and bitwise shifts; decode_fourcc reverses this process. Both functions perform standard operations without any signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. No external data sources or network activity are involved, and no code injection, data leakage, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for timing and encoding/decoding four-character codes. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code is safe and intended for general use.",
