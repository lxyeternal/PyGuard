{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and a class for measuring frame rate and encoding/decoding four-character codes (FOURCC).",
  "sources": "Time functions (`time.perf_counter()`), string input for `encode_fourcc`",
  "sinks": "None identified; no output or data transmission occurs",
  "flows": "N/A — no untrusted data flow to critical sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed",
  "analysis": "The `FPSCounter` class calculates frame rate metrics using high-precision timing, with no external data dependencies or malicious activity. The `encode_fourcc` and `decode_fourcc` functions handle encoding and decoding of four-character codes, which are standard in multimedia processing. Both functions include input validation and straightforward bitwise and character operations. The code performs basic utility functions without external calls, network activity, or data leakage points. No malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be purely utility functions and a frame rate counter with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs simple, well-understood operations without any suspicious patterns or malicious side effects.",
