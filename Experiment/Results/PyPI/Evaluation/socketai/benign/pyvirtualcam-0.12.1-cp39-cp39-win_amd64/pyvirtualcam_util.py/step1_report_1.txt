{
  "purpose": "Provide a utility for measuring frames per second (FPS) and encoding/decoding four-character codes (FourCC).",
  "sources": "time.perf_counter() for measuring time; function parameters for input validation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks, system effects, or untrusted data manipulation.",
  "flows": "N/A - No flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs straightforward calculations, encoding, and decoding.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an FPSCounter class that measures time intervals and computes FPS, using time.perf_counter(). The class updates average delta with a smoothing factor. It also provides functions to encode and decode four-character codes into integers and back, with input validation for string length. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activities. The functions and class are standard and do not interact with external systems or contain hidden code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal utility module for FPS measurement and FourCC encoding/decoding. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks present in this code snippet.",
