  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, performing FPS measurement and FourCC encoding/decoding.\n   - No report indicates any actual vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The code does not interact with external systems, handle untrusted data beyond input validation, or perform any obfuscated or malicious operations.\n   - The functions and class are standard utilities used in multimedia or graphics applications.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The only minor point is that report 5 assigns a security risk score of 0.1, which might be slightly overcautious given the benign nature of the code, but not unreasonable.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code clarity.\n   - Security risk scores are mostly 0, except report 5 which assigns 0.1. Given the benign nature, a score of 0 would be more appropriate.\n   - Confidence scores are high (1 or 0.9), which seems justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No issues justify a risk score higher than 0.5.\n   - The highest assigned is 0.1, which is acceptable for a benign utility code.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0, consistent with the code.\n   - No malicious intent or behavior is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly identify the code as utility functions with no malicious intent.\n   - No unwarranted concerns are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The only minor inconsistency is report 5's security risk score of 0.1, which could be adjusted to 0 for consistency with the rest.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (benign utility functions, no security risks)\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code is standard, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities.\n- The slight security risk score of 0.1 in report 5 seems overly cautious; I recommend lowering it to 0 for consistency.\n- Overall, the code is safe, and the reports are accurate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the code's benign nature.",
