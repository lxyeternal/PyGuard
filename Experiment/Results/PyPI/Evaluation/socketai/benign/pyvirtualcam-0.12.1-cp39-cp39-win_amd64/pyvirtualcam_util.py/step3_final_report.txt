  "purpose": "Utility functions for FPS measurement and FourCC encoding/decoding.",
  "sources": "time.perf_counter() for timing; input parameter 's' in encode_fourcc.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input string 's' flows into encode_fourcc, which validates length, then encodes; timing data flows within FPSCounter.measure() for FPS calculation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. The securityRisk score of 0.1 in one report slightly overestimates risk but is acceptable as a conservative default.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard utility functions with no external dependencies, no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. The FPSCounter uses time.perf_counter() for timing, which is standard. The encode_fourcc function validates input length and encodes characters into an integer; decode_fourcc reverses this process. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in one report is likely a conservative estimate; overall, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safety. The slight security risk score of 0.1 can be lowered to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
