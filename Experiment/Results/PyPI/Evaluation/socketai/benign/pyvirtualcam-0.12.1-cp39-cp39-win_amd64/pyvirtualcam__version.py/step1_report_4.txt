  "anomalies": "Presence of only a version assignment; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code solely sets the __version__ variable to a string indicating the version number. This is a common practice for Python packages and involves no external data input, no processing, and no malicious instructions. There are no code injections, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for Python packaging, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
