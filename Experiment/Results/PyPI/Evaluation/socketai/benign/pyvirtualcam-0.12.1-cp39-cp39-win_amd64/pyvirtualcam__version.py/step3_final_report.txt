  "purpose": "Assigns version information for the Python package.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a direct assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external output.",
  "flows": "None; simple assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version string assignment, no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard practice in Python packaging, assigning a version string to __version__. No inputs, outputs, or data flows are involved. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
