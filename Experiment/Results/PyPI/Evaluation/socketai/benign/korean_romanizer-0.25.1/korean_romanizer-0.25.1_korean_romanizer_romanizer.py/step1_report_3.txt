{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to romanize Korean Hangul text into Latin script, converting vowels and consonants based on predefined mappings.",
  "sources": "The code reads input text via the constructor parameter 'text' and the 'Pronouncer' class's 'pronounced' property, which likely processes the input for pronunciation normalization.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that lead to data leaks or external effects such as network transmission, file writing, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input text flows into 'Pronouncer' for normalization, then into the 'romanize' method, where each character is processed. If the character matches Hangul, it is converted into Latin equivalents; otherwise, it is appended directly.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes commented-out sections and redundant code lines, such as the unused conditionals and the handling of characters not matching Hangul. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The class 'Pronouncer' is external, but nothing suspicious is inferred from its usage.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward transliteration from Hangul to Latin script using predefined mappings. It uses regex to identify Hangul characters and processes each character individually. No malicious code, system calls, or suspicious data handling are present. The code appears to be a typical transliteration utility with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Hangul-to-Latin transliterator with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. It functions solely to convert Korean characters into Latin script based on established phonetic mappings.",
