{
  "purpose": "The code converts Korean Hangul characters into Latin alphabet representations based on phonetic mappings, utilizing external modules for syllable decomposition and pronunciation normalization.",
  "sources": "External modules 'korean_romanizer.syllable.Syllable' and 'korean_romanizer.pronouncer.Pronouncer' for syllable analysis and pronunciation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code processes input text and outputs romanized strings without network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input Hangul characters are processed; syllables are decomposed into initial, medial, and final components; mapped to Latin equivalents; non-Hangul characters are passed through unchanged.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code and redundant conditions are present but do not introduce malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward Hangul to Latin transliteration using predefined mappings. It relies on external modules for syllable analysis, but within this snippet, no malicious or obfuscated code is evident. The processing logic is clear, with no network or file operations. The reliance on external modules could be a vector if those modules are malicious, but the code itself remains benign. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a transparent, standard Korean romanization utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. External dependencies are a consideration but do not compromise the code's security within this context. The assigned scores are justified and accurate.",
