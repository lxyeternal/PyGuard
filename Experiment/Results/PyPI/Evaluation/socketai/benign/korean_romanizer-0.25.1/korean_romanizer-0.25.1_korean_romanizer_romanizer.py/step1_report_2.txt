{
  "purpose": "The code appears to convert Korean Hangul characters into Romanized transcription based on phonetic rules, using predefined mappings for vowels, onset consonants, and coda consonants.",
  "sources": "Input text provided during the initialization of the Romanizer class, specifically self.text and the output of Pronouncer(self.text).pronounced, which likely processes the input text.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications. The code primarily performs string processing and dictionary lookups.",
  "flows": "Input text -> Pronouncer generates pronounced form -> Each character in pronounced is matched against Hangul pattern -> Syllable object creates phonetic components -> Romanization builds string based on mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or hidden functions. The code processes text based on standard phonetic conversion rules. Commented-out code does not influence behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports external modules for Hangul processing but does not execute any external or system calls beyond string handling. The primary operation is phonetic transcription, with mappings for Korean sounds to Roman letters. No malicious or suspicious logic is present. The code structure and variable usage are consistent with a legitimate language processing tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a phonetic Romanizer for Korean Hangul characters. It performs string processing based on predefined phonetic mappings without any suspicious or malicious behavior. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
