{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to romanize Korean Hangul text into Latin script based on pronunciation rules, using specific mappings for vowels and consonants.",
  "sources": "Input text passed to the Romanizer class constructor, which is then processed by the pronouncer to generate a pronounced version of the input.",
  "sinks": "The romanize method processes the pronounced string; potential sinks include concatenation points where untrusted data could influence output, but no direct data leaks or harmful commands are present.",
  "flows": "Input text -> Pronouncer generates pronounced text -> Romanizer processes each character, converting Hangul syllables to romanized form or copying non-Hangul characters directly -> Output string is generated.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses regex matching to identify Hangul characters, but this is standard. There are commented-out lines that could suggest incomplete handling, but they do not introduce malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or hidden code segments are present. The code relies on external libraries for pronouncing and syllable parsing, but these are not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and external libraries to process Korean text, then defines mappings for vowels and consonants depending on their phonetic positions. The Romanizer class processes input text, converting Hangul characters to their romanized equivalents using these mappings. It checks each character, distinguishing between Hangul syllables and other characters, and converts accordingly. There are no indications of data exfiltration, network activity, backdoors, or other malicious behavior. The code performs string processing securely, without executing external commands or handling sensitive data beyond text transformation. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of Korean romanization. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain threats. It functions purely as a text processing utility with standard library usage and no signs of sabotage or privacy violations.",
