  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script defining package metadata.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, or data manipulation is present.\n- URLs and author info are static and typical for open-source package distribution.\n- The use of 'distutils.core' is standard, though somewhat outdated compared to 'setuptools', but this does not imply malicious intent.\n- No suspicious or obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data flows.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description and appears to be a standard setup script.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; all reports assign malware score 0.\n- **Anomalies or suspicious patterns:** None, including obfuscation, suspicious URLs, or code anomalies.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the code does not process untrusted data or execute dynamic code.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Scores:\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the static, non-executable nature of the script.\n- **Security risk:** Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1, which is acceptable given the context (metadata configuration).\n\n### Justification:\n- The code does not perform any actions beyond static metadata assignment.\n- The URLs and email are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n- No signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or external data handling.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The use of 'distutils.core' is outdated but not malicious.\n- The URLs and author info are typical for open-source packages.\n- No evidence suggests any security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nBased on the provided code and reports, I concur with the assessments that this is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis or details are needed.",
