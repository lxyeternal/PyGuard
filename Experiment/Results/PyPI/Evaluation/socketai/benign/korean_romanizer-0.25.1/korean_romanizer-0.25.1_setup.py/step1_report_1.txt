  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'korean_romanizer' Python package.",
  "sources": "The setup() function and its parameters such as author_email, url, and download_url.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the URLs and email address that could be used for data exfiltration or malicious contact, but here they are standard metadata.",
  "flows": "Metadata fields like author_email, url, and download_url could be used as sources, but no actual data flow or execution logic is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or obfuscated code are present. Use of distutils is common for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports distutils.core.setup to define package metadata and configuration. It specifies package details, author info, URLs, and classifiers. No dynamic code, input handling, or data manipulation occurs. URLs and email are typical for open-source packages. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, and no code execution beyond static setup is performed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate package configuration code.",
