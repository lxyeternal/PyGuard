  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for packaging the 'korean_romanizer' Python library for distribution.",
  "sources": "Input data includes package metadata such as name, version, author, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands; no network or data leakage points in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input source (metadata) to packaging configuration but does not involve untrusted data manipulation or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. Usage of 'distutils.core' is standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using 'distutils' to define package metadata. It specifies package info, author details, URLs, and classifiers. No suspicious or malicious code is present. No dynamic code execution, no external data handling, and no security-sensitive operations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be legitimate packaging code for the 'korean_romanizer' library.",
