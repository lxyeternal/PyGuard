  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields such as name, version, author, url, and classifiers; no external or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and conventional. Use of deprecated 'distutils.core' noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup script with no dynamic code, obfuscated patterns, or external data processing. No suspicious URLs, email addresses, or code execution paths are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is conservative; given the static nature, it can be considered zero. The use of 'distutils' is outdated but not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the evidence.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
