  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup parameters for publishing the 'korean_romanizer' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data, such as package name, version, author info, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the setup configuration does not execute or process external inputs.",
  "flows": "The code flows from static configuration definitions to the setup() function call, which prepares the package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python setup procedures with static data. It imports 'distutils.core' for package setup, which is a typical approach. No external input handling, code injection, or malicious payloads are present. The URLs and email appear legitimate and are static. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
