{
  "purpose": "To define and configure the packaging information for the 'korean_romanizer' Python library for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata, such as name, version, license, author info, URL, and download URL.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or data processing that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: static metadata is provided to the setup function, with no external input or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code uses standard setup patterns with no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from distutils.core and calls it with static parameters defining package metadata. All data appears hardcoded and standard for package distribution. There are no user inputs, no environment variables, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity or sensitive data handling. No suspicious or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior, no malicious code, and no security risks. It simply defines package metadata for distribution.",
