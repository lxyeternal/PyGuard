{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'korean_romanizer' Python package, including metadata and distribution info.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of package metadata; no input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only defines package metadata without data flow or execution of untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'distutils.core' instead of the more modern 'setuptools' is outdated but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script defining package metadata for distribution. It does not include dynamic execution, input handling, or external data flows. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The use of 'distutils.core' is deprecated but benign in terms of security. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies identified.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
