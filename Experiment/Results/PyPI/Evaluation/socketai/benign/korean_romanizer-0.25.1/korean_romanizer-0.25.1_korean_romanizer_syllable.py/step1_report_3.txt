{
  "purpose": "This code appears to handle Korean Hangul syllable manipulation, including decomposition and reconstruction of syllables using Unicode values.",
  "sources": "The code reads characters from input strings, particularly individual characters to determine if they are Hangul syllables and to process their Unicode code points.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks are present; the code modifies internal state and returns characters, with no data leakage or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "The flow involves separating input characters into components, reconstructing characters from components, and modifying internal attributes of the Syllable objects.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation. The code strictly processes Unicode Hangul characters without external system interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Unicode ranges and mappings for Korean Hangul syllables and provides a class for decomposing and reconstructing such characters. It uses standard Unicode arithmetic and indexing methods without any hidden or malicious logic. The methods perform straightforward transformations and checks, with no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or external network activity. The code is structured, readable, and focused solely on Hangul syllable processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for processing Hangul syllables. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The logic is consistent with standard Unicode processing techniques and does not exhibit obfuscation or security risks.",
