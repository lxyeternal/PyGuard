{
  "purpose": "The code appears to handle Hangul (Korean script) syllable decomposition and construction, including mapping between initial, medial, and final components.",
  "sources": "The code reads input characters during the instantiation of the Syllable object (char parameter) and within methods such as separate_syllable, construct_syllable, and is_hangul.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include the assignment to self.char and returning constructed characters, but these are standard operations for manipulating and reconstructing Hangul characters. There are no data leaks, network operations, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input character (source) is processed in separate_syllable to determine if it's Hangul, decomposing it into indices. These indices are used in construct_syllable to rebuild the character. The flow is internal to character decomposition and recomposition without external data flow or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code relies solely on standard Unicode manipulations for Hangul characters. No hardcoded secrets, network access, or system modifications are present. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides methods for decomposing Hangul syllables into their components and reconstructing them. It uses standard Unicode calculations based on known Hangul Unicode ranges and offsets. The class methods are typical for linguistic processing and do not perform any external operations or side effects. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Hangul syllable decomposition and reconstruction. It contains no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to manipulate Hangul characters based on Unicode standards, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
