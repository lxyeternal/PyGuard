  "purpose": "Importing modules from the 'korean_romanizer' package for Korean language processing and romanization.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'korean_romanizer.syllable', 'korean_romanizer.pronouncer', and 'korean_romanizer.romanizer'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static import statements without execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; straightforward import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a benign open-source language processing library. There is no executable logic, data handling, network activity, or malicious code present. The imports are from a reputable package, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are correctly set to 0, reflecting the benign nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The import statements are standard for language processing and do not pose any threat. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
