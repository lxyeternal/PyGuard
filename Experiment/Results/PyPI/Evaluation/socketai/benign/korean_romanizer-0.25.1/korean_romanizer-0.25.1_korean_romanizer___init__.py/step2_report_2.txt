  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the provided scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as merely importing modules from the 'korean_romanizer' package.\n- No executable logic, data handling, network activity, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the benign nature of import statements.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, which is appropriate given the lack of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, as expected; no obfuscation is evident.\n- Security risk scores are 0, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis:\n\n**1. Reports 1 & 2:**  \n- Both are identical in purpose, sources, and analysis.  \n- They conclude the code is benign with high confidence.  \n- Scores: `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0` — appropriate.\n\n**2. Report 3:**  \n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still high.  \n- Same conclusion: benign.  \n- Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**3. Reports 4 & 5:**  \n- Both have full confidence (1) and identical reasoning.  \n- Also conclude benign nature with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or discrepancies:\n\n- **No actual code execution or data flow**: All reports correctly identify that only import statements are present, which are not malicious in themselves.\n- **Malware and obfuscation scores**: Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk scores**: Also appropriately 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious activities are evident.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code snippet's content.\n- No adjustments needed; the reasoning aligns with the code provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the uniformity and the nature of the code (simple imports), **the overall malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0**.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No further action or suspicion is warranted based on this snippet.",
