  "purpose": "Import modules related to Korean syllable processing, pronunciation, and romanization",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'korean_romanizer' package",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions detected",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as no executable code or data handling is shown",
  "anomalies": "Only import statements; no execution, data processing, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for modules within the 'korean_romanizer' package. There are no function calls, data processing, network operations, or other executable logic. Importing standard or third-party libraries is not inherently suspicious; however, the package's purpose suggests it processes language data. No signs of malicious activity or anomalies are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based solely on these imports.",
