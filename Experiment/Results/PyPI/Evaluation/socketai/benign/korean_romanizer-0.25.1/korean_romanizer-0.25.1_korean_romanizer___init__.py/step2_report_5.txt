  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the evidence and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as merely importing modules from the 'korean_romanizer' package.\n- No executable logic, data processing, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The package appears to be an open-source library for Korean language processing, which is benign.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate, straightforward.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** The scores are appropriate; no issues.\n\n#### Report 2\n- Similar to Report 1, consistent reasoning.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 3\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still consistent.\n- **Scores:** confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no suspicious activity.\n\n#### Report 4\n- Similar to previous, full confidence.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 5\n- Same reasoning, full confidence.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n- All reports correctly assign malware and security risk scores as 0.\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n- Obfuscation is correctly marked as 0, given the straightforward import statements.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the code only imports modules and contains no executable logic, the **malware score** should remain at 0.\n- The **obfuscated score** is also appropriately 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- The **risk score** is correctly 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious activity are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores are consistent with the provided analysis and the nature of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reasoning is sound, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments, confirming the code's safety.",
