{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Korean syllable pronunciation converter that modifies final consonants according to pronunciation rules.",
  "sources": "The input text passed to the Pronouncer class during initialization; the _syllables list created from input text characters.",
  "sinks": "The manipulation of syllable.final and next_syllable.initial attributes, which influence pronunciation output.",
  "flows": "Input text -> Syllable objects -> final_substitute() method modifies final consonants -> final consonants are replaced or altered -> pronunciation string generated.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains detailed phonetic rules for Korean pronunciation, with no hardcoded credentials, environment variables, network activity, or obfuscated code. No external data sources or sinks suggest malicious activity. Use of exception handling is straightforward and related to attribute access.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary for double consonant finals, a NULL_CONSONANT constant, and a Pronouncer class. The class processes input text into Syllable objects, then applies complex phonetic rules within the final_substitute method to modify final consonants based on context. These modifications reflect Korean pronunciation rules and are purely linguistic in nature. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or hidden backdoors are present. The logic is consistent with linguistic transformations, with no signs of malicious intent or malware behaviors. The code operates within expected parameters for a phonetic processing module, with no anomalies indicating sabotage or malicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a linguistic processing tool for Korean syllable pronunciation adjustments. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. It simply applies language-specific rules to modify syllable finals. Overall, the code appears benign and safe for use.",
