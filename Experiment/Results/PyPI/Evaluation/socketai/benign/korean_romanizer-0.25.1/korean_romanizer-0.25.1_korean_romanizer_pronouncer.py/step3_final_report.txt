{
  "purpose": "A Korean phonological processing module that adjusts final consonants and pronunciation features based on linguistic rules.",
  "sources": "Internal object attributes (`final`, `initial`) of `Syllable` objects during iteration.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network, or file I/O; no untrusted data sources or outputs.",
  "flows": "The code reads each `Syllable` object, applies rule-based modifications to `final` and `initial` attributes, and updates the sequence accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Attribute manipulations are standard for linguistic processing.",
  "analysis": "The code processes Korean syllables by applying phonological rules, manipulating internal attributes without external interactions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The logic is consistent with linguistic standards, and exception handling is straightforward. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (~0.1) are justified given the benign, purpose-specific nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, transparent Korean pronunciation processing module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
