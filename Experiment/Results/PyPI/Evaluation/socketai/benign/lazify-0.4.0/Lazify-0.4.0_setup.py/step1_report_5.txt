  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data use",
  "flows": "Reading README file as source, no other data flow or external data usage",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for packaging, defines a function to read a README file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata. The code structure is standard for Python package setup files. There are no signs of malicious code, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated logic. No external data flows or input handling beyond reading a local file are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
