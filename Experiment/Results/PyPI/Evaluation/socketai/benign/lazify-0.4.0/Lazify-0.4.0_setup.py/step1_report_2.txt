{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'Lazify', used for package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.rst' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input flow from reading the README file to include its content as long_description in setup(), no other data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code observed. The code appears straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools', defines a function to read a README file, and calls setup() with package metadata. The code is simple, conventional, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious patterns. There are no external data inputs other than reading a file, which is standard practice. No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply configures package metadata for distribution.",
