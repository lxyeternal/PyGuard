  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'Lazify', used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.rst' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing paths that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "File reading from 'README.rst' as input; no data flows to sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code performs standard setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and defines a function to read a README file. It then calls 'setup()' with package metadata, including name, version, URL, author info, description, modules, platforms, and classifiers. The code appears straightforward, typical of Python package setup files, with no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no security risks identified.",
