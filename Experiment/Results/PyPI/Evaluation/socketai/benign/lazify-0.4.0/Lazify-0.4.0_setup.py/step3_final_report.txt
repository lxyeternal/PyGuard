  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python package setup script that configures package metadata and reads a local README file for the long description.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.rst' file from the local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the script only passes static data to setuptools.setup().",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the local 'README.rst' file into the 'long_description' parameter, then into the setup process without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling. It reads a local file and passes static metadata to setuptools. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and clarity. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate, and the current scores are appropriate.",
