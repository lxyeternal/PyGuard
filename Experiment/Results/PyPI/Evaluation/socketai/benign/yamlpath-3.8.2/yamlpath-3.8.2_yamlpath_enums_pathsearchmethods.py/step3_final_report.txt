  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for YAML path search methods with string representations and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Enum members and static methods within the PathSearchMethods class.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process external input or data.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions and utility functions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward enum class with string mappings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple enumeration class providing search method identifiers and their string representations. It includes utility methods for listing operators and validating symbols. There are no external data inputs, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The code is well-structured, with clear docstrings, and serves as a utility component. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility enum class for search operators with no malicious intent or security risks. The provided reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
