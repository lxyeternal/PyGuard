{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for different YAML path search methods, including string matching and comparison operators.",
  "sources": "The code does not read any external input or data; it solely defines an enumeration and utility methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or other effects, as the code does not perform data processing or I/O.",
  "flows": "The code provides static methods to retrieve operator symbols and check their validity, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and only includes enum definitions and utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enum class for various search methods, with descriptive docstrings and string representation logic. It includes static methods for retrieving operators and checking operator validity. There are no external inputs, data processing, or external calls that could introduce security risks. The code does not handle user input, configuration, or data sources that could be manipulated maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple enumeration definition with utility methods, free from malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process or handle external data, and its purpose is solely to represent search method options.",
