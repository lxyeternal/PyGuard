{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for different path search methods, including string matching and comparison operators, for use in YAML path segment searches.",
  "sources": "The enum class PathSearchMethods and its methods provide static lists and string representations of enum members; no external data input is present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code purely defines enum members and static methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward enumeration definition with string representations and utility methods. No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum with various search operators, including methods to convert enum members to strings, list all operators, and verify if a string is a valid operator. It is well-structured, with no external data input, no dynamic code execution, and no data leakage. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard enumeration for search operators, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs simple utility functions and contains no external or untrusted data handling.",
