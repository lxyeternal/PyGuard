{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for different path search methods used in YAML processing, providing string representations and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Enum class attributes and methods, including auto() for value assignment, and string conversion functions.",
  "sinks": "String conversion methods and list returns; no direct data leaks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The code maps enum members to strings and checks for operator presence, without external data or untrusted input flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and typical for enum definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enumeration for path search methods with descriptive docstrings and utility methods. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no sensitive data handling. The functions simply provide mappings and checks related to enum members. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The implementation is standard for such an enum structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard enumeration definition for search operators, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and intended solely for defining constants and utility functions related to path search methods.",
