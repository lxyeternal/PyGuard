  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for various path search methods used in YAML processing, including string matching and comparison operators.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present in this code. The code solely defines a class and static methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present. The code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code is purely definitional with no data processing or I/O.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is a straightforward enumeration class with string representations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines an Enum class with search operators, provides string conversion and operator list methods. There is no input/output, no dynamic code execution, or external network interactions. It appears to be a standard utility class for internal use in a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a utility class defining enumeration values and their string representations. No signs of malware or security vulnerabilities are present.",
