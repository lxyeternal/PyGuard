{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for different path search methods used in YAML processing, including string matching and comparison operations.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; the code defines a class with static methods and constants.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output mechanisms are present; the code is purely defining enum and utility functions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external or untrusted input; static methods operate on internal data only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code creates an Enum class with various search methods for YAML path segments, providing string representations and utility functions. There are no input operations, data leaks, or network activities. The class methods are static and serve only to facilitate symbolic representation and identification of operators. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple enumeration definition with associated utility methods for string representation and operator checks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this module.",
