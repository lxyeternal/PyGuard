  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module functioning as a wrapper around external YAML processing functions. It only outputs a deprecation warning and does not process untrusted data or contain malicious logic. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), primarily due to the deprecation warning. It is safe for use with no security concerns."
