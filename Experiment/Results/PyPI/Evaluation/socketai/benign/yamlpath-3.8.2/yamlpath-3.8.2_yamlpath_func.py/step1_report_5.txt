{
  "purpose": "This module provides helper functions that act as relays to static methods in various imported modules, mainly for YAML processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially 'yamlpath.common', 'yamlpath.wrappers', 'yamlpath', and the standard 'sys' module; the deprecation warning print statement.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly handle untrusted input; the only output is a deprecation warning printed to stderr.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; all functions are simple relays to static methods with no data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a deprecation warning message indicating outdated functions; no other unusual code patterns or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly serves as a wrapper interface that forwards calls to static methods in imported modules. It contains a deprecation warning printed to stderr, which could be used maliciously to mislead or confuse users, but is generally benign. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are detected. The reliance on external modules limits a full security assessment, but based on this code alone, there are no signs of malware or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward relay layer for helper functions with an intentionally deprecated warning. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or obfuscation present. It appears to be a benign utility module that facilitates YAML processing.",
