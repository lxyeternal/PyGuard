  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is a straightforward set of wrapper functions with a deprecation warning.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None identified; the logic is simple and benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.1. These seem appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Justification for Risk Score:** Minimal, as no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Overall:** No concerns; the code is safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Similar to Report 1, a benign wrapper with a deprecation warning.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0. Slightly lower risk, which is reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; only a warning message.\n- **Overall:** Safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Wrapper functions that relay to external modules.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.1. Slightly elevated risk score, but justified due to the warning message.\n- **Justification:** The deprecation warning is benign; no malicious activity.\n- **Overall:** No security concern.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Similar pattern.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Justification:** Safe, straightforward wrapper.\n- **Overall:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Wrapper functions with a deprecation warning.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Justification:** The warning message could be misused if malicious, but in this context, it's benign.\n- **Overall:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports show 0.0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0.1, with one at 0.0. Given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities, a risk score of 0.0 would be more appropriate, but 0.1 is acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n### My Overall Estimation:\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.05** — very low; the only minor concern is the deprecation warning, which is benign.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign helper module with no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and negligible security risk. The current scores are reasonable, but I would suggest lowering the risk score to 0.05 for precision.",
