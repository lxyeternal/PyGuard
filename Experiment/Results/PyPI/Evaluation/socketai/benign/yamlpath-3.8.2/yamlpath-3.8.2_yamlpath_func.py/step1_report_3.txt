  "purpose": "Provide helper functions as relay interfaces to static methods from yamlpath modules for YAML data processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements; print statement for deprecation warning; function calls to external yamlpath modules.",
  "sinks": "Function calls to external modules (Parsers, Nodes, Anchors, Searches, YAMLPath, NodeCoords) that could process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "External input data flows into functions, which invoke static methods in external modules that may handle untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior; the code primarily consists of relay functions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules and defines several wrapper functions that call static methods from external yamlpath components. The only notable behavior is printing a deprecation warning to stderr. No input handling, data processing, or network interactions are present. Since these functions simply pass arguments to external libraries, the security of data depends on the external modules. The code itself does not perform any malicious actions, contain hardcoded secrets, or exhibit obfuscated code. It is a straightforward relay layer with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code acts as a benign relay layer for yamlpath utility functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment.",
