{
  "purpose": "A set of helper functions relaying calls to static methods from yamlpath modules, primarily serving as wrappers with a deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "Function calls to external static methods in yamlpath.common, yamlpath.wrappers, yamlpath, and related modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; only outputs a deprecation warning to stderr.",
  "flows": "Function arguments are passed directly to external static methods; no internal data processing or untrusted data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a deprecation warning print statement; no malicious or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of wrapper functions that relay calls to external static methods, with a single print statement issuing a deprecation warning. No user input, network activity, or data manipulation occurs within this code. External modules are assumed safe. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident. The code's simplicity and transparency reduce the likelihood of malicious intent. The deprecation warning, while potentially confusing, is benign and standard in software maintenance. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and contains no malware or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module functioning as a wrapper around external YAML processing functions. It only outputs a deprecation warning and does not process untrusted data or contain malicious logic. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), primarily due to the deprecation warning. It is safe for use with no security concerns.",
