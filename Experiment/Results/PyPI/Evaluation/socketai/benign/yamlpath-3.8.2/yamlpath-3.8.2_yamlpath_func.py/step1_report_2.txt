{
  "purpose": "This code provides helper functions for YAML processing, primarily relaying calls to static methods from imported modules to simplify external API usage.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are read directly within this code. It imports modules and prints a deprecation warning message to standard error.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or outputs are identified that handle untrusted data. The only output is a static warning message to stderr.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code primarily consists of wrapper functions relaying calls and a warning message.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a deprecation warning message printed to stderr, which is standard. All functions are simple relays to other static methods. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific modules and defines wrapper functions that simply forward arguments to static methods of those modules. The only executable code besides function definitions is a print statement that outputs a deprecation warning to standard error, which is benign. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads present. The code appears to be a benign utility library designed to simplify access to underlying YAML processing functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward helper utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely wraps existing static methods and outputs a deprecation warning. There are no anomalies or indicators of malicious intent. Overall, it is safe.",
