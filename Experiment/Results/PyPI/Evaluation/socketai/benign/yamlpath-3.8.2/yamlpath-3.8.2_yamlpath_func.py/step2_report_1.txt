  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a set of helper functions relaying calls to static methods, with only a deprecation warning printed to stderr. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity identified.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — straightforward code.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to the deprecation warning, which is benign.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues or malicious activity.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a benign wrapper with only a deprecation warning. No external input handling or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malware.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — simple relay functions.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — negligible risk.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Wrapper functions relaying to external modules; deprecation warning only. No suspicious behavior or malicious code.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malware.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — straightforward functions.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, mainly due to the deprecation warning.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar analysis; no data processing or malicious activity. The only notable aspect is reliance on external modules and a deprecation warning.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malware.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — clear code.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is a simple relay with a deprecation warning; no malicious behavior.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malware.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify that there's no malicious activity. The code is purely a wrapper with no dynamic or malicious payloads.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero, as the code is straightforward and transparent.  \n- **Risk Score:** Very low (around 0.1), primarily because of the deprecation warning, which is benign.  \n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- The code is a benign utility module serving as a wrapper to external YAML processing functions.  \n- The deprecation warning, while potentially confusing or indicating outdated code, does not pose a security threat.  \n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.  \n- The data flows are limited to internal function calls and a benign warning message.\n\n**Estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no security concerns. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware score correctly reflects the absence of malicious activity.",
