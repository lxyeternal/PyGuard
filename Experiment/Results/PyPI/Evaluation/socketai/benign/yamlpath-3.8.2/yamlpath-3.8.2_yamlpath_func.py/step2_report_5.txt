  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the potential security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of wrapper functions that relay calls to static methods from imported modules related to YAML processing.\n- The only executable action outside function definitions is printing a deprecation warning to `sys.stderr`.\n- No user input is processed directly; no network activity, data manipulation, or system modifications are evident.\n- The functions themselves do not contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- External modules are invoked with user-provided arguments, but this is standard for wrapper functions and does not imply malicious intent.\n- The deprecation warning, while potentially confusing or misleading if ignored, is benign and common in software libraries.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- **Presence of malicious code or backdoors:** None.\n- **Hardcoded secrets or credentials:** None.\n- **Obfuscated or suspicious code patterns:** None.\n- **Malware or malicious behavior:** Not present.\n- **Data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks:** Not evident within this code snippet.\n\n### Risks and scores:\n- The overall **security risk** is minimal; the only concern might be the deprecation warning, which is benign.\n- The **malware score** should be **0**, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** should be **0**, as code is straightforward.\n- The **risk score** can be set very low, around **0.1**, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Addressing individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Correctly identifies the code as benign, with no malicious activity.  \n- The risk score of 0.1 is reasonable.  \n- Malware score 0, obfuscated 0.  \n- **No change needed.**\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Also correctly notes the code's benign nature.  \n- The risk score of 0 is appropriate, considering no active processing or external data handling.  \n- Malware score 0, obfuscated 0.  \n- **No change needed.**\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Recognizes that the functions are simple relays and that the only notable action is printing a deprecation warning.  \n- The risk score of 0.1 is suitable.  \n- Malware score 0, obfuscated 0.  \n- **No change needed.**\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Correctly states the code is straightforward with no malicious behavior.  \n- The risk score of 0.1 is appropriate.  \n- Malware score 0, obfuscated 0.  \n- **No change needed.**\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Also notes the benign nature, with no suspicious activity.  \n- The risk score of 0.1 is fine.  \n- Malware score 0, obfuscated 0.  \n- **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to deprecation warning, which is benign)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign helper module acting as a relay layer to YAML processing functions. It only outputs a deprecation warning and does not process untrusted data directly. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores. No security concerns arise from this code snippet.",
