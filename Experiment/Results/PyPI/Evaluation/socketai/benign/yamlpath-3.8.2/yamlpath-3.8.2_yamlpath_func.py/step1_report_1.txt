{
  "purpose": "This code provides helper functions that relay calls to static methods from imported modules, primarily related to YAML processing and manipulation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external modules (`sys`, `yamlpath.common`, `yamlpath.wrappers`, `yamlpath`). The print statement outputs a deprecation warning to standard error.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs a message to sys.stderr, which is generally safe. No other sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No complex data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs; functions are simple relays to static methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a deprecation warning message, but no suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules and defines multiple relay functions that call static methods from those modules, mainly related to YAML data handling. The only output is a deprecation warning printed to standard error. The functions do not process any user input or untrusted data directly; they merely wrap calls to other modules. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are identified. The overall structure and logic are straightforward and standard for helper modules. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a non-malicious helper module that relays function calls to other parts of a YAML processing library. It only outputs a deprecation warning to stderr and contains no suspicious or malicious code. Overall security risk is minimal.",
