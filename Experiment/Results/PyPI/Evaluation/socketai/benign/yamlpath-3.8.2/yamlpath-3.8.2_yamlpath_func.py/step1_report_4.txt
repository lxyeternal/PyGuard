{
  "purpose": "Provide helper functions that relay calls to static methods for YAML processing and manipulation.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources are directly read; functions are primarily relays to static methods from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data directly; the code only calls static methods from external libraries, which are assumed to be safe.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this code. The relayed functions depend on external libraries, which are not part of this code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a deprecation warning message printed to stderr; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward and mainly acts as a wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple wrapper functions that delegate calls to static methods imported from other modules. The only active operation is printing a deprecation warning message. No data input processing, network activity, or system modifications are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The relayed functions themselves are safe as they depend on external, presumably trusted, libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of wrapper functions with no malicious intent. It serves to simplify or abstract access to external YAML processing functions. There are no signs of malware, suspicious data flows, or security risks.",
