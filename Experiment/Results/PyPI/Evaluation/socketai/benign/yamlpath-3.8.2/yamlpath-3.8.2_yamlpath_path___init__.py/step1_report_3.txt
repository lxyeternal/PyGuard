  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data output or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Import statements flow from modules to local namespace, no data processing or transfer present",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behavior; straightforward import statements with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, with no other logic or data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The import statements are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal module import section with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply makes certain classes available from local modules.",
