  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details and scoring.\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code is just import statements with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None identified. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct, no malicious activity.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct, straightforward import statements.  \n  - Risk: 0 — appropriate, no security risk.  \n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?** Not applicable; scores are appropriate.  \n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Same as above, purely import statements.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?** No, the scores are reasonable.  \n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code only imports modules/classes.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — slightly above zero, but given the code is benign, perhaps a minimal security concern due to potential for future malicious imports, but not necessarily justified here.  \n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?** No, the score is low and consistent with benign code.  \n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Same as above, simple import statements.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?** No.  \n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Just import statements.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, consisting solely of import statements.  \n- The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate given the code.  \n- Obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with straightforward imports.  \n- Risk scores are very low or zero, aligning with the absence of any security concern.\n\n### Final notes:\n\n- The code snippet is standard module import code with no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- No changes needed in scores or reasoning.  \n- Given the absence of any actual malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities, I would assign the following estimated scores for the code as a whole:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0  \n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is harmless, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
