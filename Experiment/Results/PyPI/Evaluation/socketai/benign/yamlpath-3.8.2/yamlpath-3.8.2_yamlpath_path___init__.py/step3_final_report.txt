{
  "purpose": "This code imports three modules related to search and collection terms, likely for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports local modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, which are static and do not execute any malicious or insecure operations. There are no dynamic code executions, data handling, or external data inputs. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. Given the benign nature, the malware score is set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and security risk is minimal. The confidence in this assessment is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import statement with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are justified and consistent with the benign analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
