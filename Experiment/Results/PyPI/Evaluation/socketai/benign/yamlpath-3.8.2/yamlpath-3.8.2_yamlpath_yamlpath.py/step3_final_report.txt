  "purpose": "A YAML Path parser and serializer handling complex path syntax, escaping, and segment management.",
  "sources": "Parsing functions, escape functions, string manipulation, and internal data structures; no external data sources or network calls.",
  "sinks": "Internal string processing; no data leaks, system modifications, or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Input YAML path string → parsing into segments → internal data structures → stringification or manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard parsing logic, no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive YAML Path utility with detailed parsing, escaping, and path management functions. It does not perform network operations, system modifications, or dynamic code execution. The complex logic is typical for such utilities and is well-structured. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-implemented YAML Path parser with no security concerns or malware indications. The low scores are justified and appropriate.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
