  "purpose": "Define core YAML path classes and set a version number for the package",
  "sources": "The version string __version__ and imports from yamlpath modules",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is primarily defining metadata and importing modules",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports two modules related to YAML path processing. There are no inputs, outputs, or execution flows that handle untrusted data or perform any operations beyond importing and setting a version. No malware or security risks are evident in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, minimal setup code defining versioning and importing core components. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.",
