  "purpose": "Define the core YAML Path classes and establish a version number for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'yamlpath.yamlpath' and 'yamlpath.processor'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only module imports and a version declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements; the code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports two modules from the 'yamlpath' package. There are no data inputs, no execution of untrusted code, nor any suspicious logic. The imports are typical for a module that relies on other components, and the version declaration is standard practice. No anomalies, malicious patterns, or security risks are evident in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module header with imports and a version number, showing no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
