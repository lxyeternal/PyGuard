  "purpose": "Define core YAML Path classes and establish a version number for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external modules 'yamlpath.yamlpath' and 'yamlpath.processor'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only import statements and version declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports two modules relevant to YAML path processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The imports are standard for a Python package establishing core classes. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward initialization snippet for a YAML processing library. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements.",
