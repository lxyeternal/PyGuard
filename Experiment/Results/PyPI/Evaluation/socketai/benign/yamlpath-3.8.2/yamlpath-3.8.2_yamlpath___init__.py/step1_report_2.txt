  "purpose": "Define core YAML path classes and set a version number for the package.",
  "sources": "The version string __version__ and the imported modules 'yamlpath.yamlpath' and 'yamlpath.processor'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or external sources; imports are static, and version assignment is hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports two modules related to YAML path processing. There are no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted data, and no network or system commands. The structure is simple and standard for a module's initial setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, non-malicious module setup with no indications of malware or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious actions or contain obfuscated code. Overall, it appears safe.",
