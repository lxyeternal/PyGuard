{
  "purpose": "Define the package version and import core modules for YAML path processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string '__version__' and imports 'yamlpath.yamlpath' and 'yamlpath.processor'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "The code assigns a static version string and imports modules without dynamic data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; minimal and straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module header: it sets a version string and imports modules necessary for YAML path processing. There are no functions, no data processing, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The static nature and lack of dynamic or untrusted input handling indicate a benign setup snippet. All signals point to standard, safe code with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initialization snippet with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and functionality.",
