  "purpose": "Defines a SearchTerms class for YAML path search segment terms, including search parameters and string representation.",
  "sources": "The class constructor accepts parameters: inverted (bool), method (PathSearchMethods), attribute (str), and term (str). The __str__ method processes the term for display.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling points; the code does not process external inputs or write outputs. No system or network calls are made.",
  "flows": "The only flow involves setting attributes via constructor and converting to string with __str__, which formats the term. No external or untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code related to potential dynamic class creation or import logic; no active code suggests malicious intent. No suspicious code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious variable usage. The string formatting in __str__ is straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The class is a straightforward data container for search parameters with a string representation method. No input handling, external calls, or data manipulation that could be malicious are present. The only complex part is string formatting in __str__, which is benign and meant for display. Commented-out code does not execute and appears to be related to Python version compatibility. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign data structure used for YAML path search configuration. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or suspicious anomalies detected.",
