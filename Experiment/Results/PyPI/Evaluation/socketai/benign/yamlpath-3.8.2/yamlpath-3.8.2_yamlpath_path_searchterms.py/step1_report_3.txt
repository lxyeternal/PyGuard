{
  "purpose": "Define a class for representing search terms in YAML path queries, including search attributes, methods, and inversion flags.",
  "sources": "Input parameters during object initialization: 'inverted', 'method', 'attribute', 'term'; also properties accessing these attributes.",
  "sinks": "The '__str__' method generates a string representation of the object, which could potentially be used in code injection if misused, but there are no direct sinks like network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "The input parameters are stored in internal variables, and the '__str__' method constructs a string based on 'method', 'attribute', 'term', and 'inverted'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; commented-out code related to class method creation is harmless and appears to be a deprecated note about Python version compatibility. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data container for search parameters with proper encapsulation via properties. The '__str__' method carefully escapes characters for safe string representation, particularly handling regex patterns and spacing. The commented-out code indicates awareness of Python version issues but does not introduce any malicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or insecure practices are evident. Overall, this appears to be a benign utility class for internal use.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign class for managing YAML search terms. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The commented-out code is related to Python version compatibility and does not pose a security concern.",
