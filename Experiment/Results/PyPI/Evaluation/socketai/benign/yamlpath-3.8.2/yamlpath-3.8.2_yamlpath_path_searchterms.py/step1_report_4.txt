{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for representing search terms used in YAML path searches, including properties and string representations.",
  "sources": "No direct input or data reading; primarily defines a class and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no data leakage or external communication points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; purely data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Contains commented-out code for Python version compatibility; no unusual behavior or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition with properties and a string representation method. It imports an enum for search methods and provides attributes for inversion, method, attribute name, and search term. No external input reading, data output, or network communication is present. The commented-out code pertains to compatibility with older Python versions, which is benign. The string method constructs a sanitized string representation without executing untrusted code or performing unsafe operations. Overall, the code appears to be a standard utility class with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class definition for YAML search terms with no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security risks. It is benign and primarily used for data encapsulation and representation.",
