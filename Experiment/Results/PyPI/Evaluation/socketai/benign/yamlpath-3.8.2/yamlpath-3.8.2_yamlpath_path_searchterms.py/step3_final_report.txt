  "purpose": "Defines a class representing search terms for YAML path queries, including attributes for inversion, search method, attribute name, and search term, with string formatting for display.",
  "sources": "Class constructor parameters, internal attributes, and the __str__ method handling string formatting.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input/output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Initialization from parameters, string formatting in __str__ method, property accessors returning internal attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code related to Python version compatibility and a commented-out class method for creating instances from external attributes; both are harmless and inactive.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data container class with no external data handling, dynamic code execution, or network activity. String formatting in __str__ is safe and intended for display purposes. Commented-out code is related to Python version compatibility and is inactive, posing no security risk. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score in one report due to commented-out code is justified but does not indicate an active threat. Overall, the code is a simple, safe utility class suitable for its purpose.",
