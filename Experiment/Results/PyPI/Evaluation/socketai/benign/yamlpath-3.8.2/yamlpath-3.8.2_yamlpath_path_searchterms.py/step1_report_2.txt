{
  "purpose": "Defines a SearchTerms class for YAML path search segment terms, including attributes and methods for search configuration.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class constructor parameters and property getters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no execution of untrusted data or external calls based on current code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly initializes and represents search configurations.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code for classmethod that could generate instances from external attributes; no active suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a data structure with properties and a string representation method. It includes comments about Python version compatibility and some commented-out code. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The class is used for representing search parameters, not for executing malicious actions. No hardcoded secrets, external system calls, or obfuscated code are detected. The only potential concern is the commented-out code, which is harmless in current context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a search terms data container without any malicious intent or security risks. It contains no active malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies. Overall security risk is negligible.",
