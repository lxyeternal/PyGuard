  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score in one report due to commented-out code is justified but does not indicate an active threat. Overall, the code is a simple, safe utility class suitable for its purpose."
