  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The class is a simple data container with no active code that handles external inputs or performs malicious actions. The only string formatting in `__str__` is benign, intended for display.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, straightforward data structure with no security concerns.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the class being a configuration holder. No dynamic code or external data handling. Commented-out code is harmless.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — negligible security risk.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues, purely a data container.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Defines a class for search terms, with safe string formatting and no external interactions. Commented-out code is about compatibility, not malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard utility class.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports; no external data handling or malicious logic. Commented code is benign.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign class definition.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a straightforward class with safe string processing. Commented-out code is harmless.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, primarily due to the commented-out code, which is not active.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, and the code is a simple data container with string formatting for display.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Consistently zero or near-zero; the only minor point is the commented-out code, which doesn't introduce any security risk.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code does not perform any network, file, or system operations.\n- It does not process untrusted input beyond internal string formatting.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- Commented-out code is benign and relates to Python version compatibility.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is entirely benign, with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports are consistent with this assessment.",
