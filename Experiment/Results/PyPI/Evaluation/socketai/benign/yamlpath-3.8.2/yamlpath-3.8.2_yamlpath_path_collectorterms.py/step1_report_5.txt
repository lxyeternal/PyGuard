  "purpose": "Define a class for handling YAML Path Collector terms with associated operations.",
  "sources": "The 'expression' parameter in __init__, imported CollectorOperators enum.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Initialization assigns 'expression' and 'operation' to internal variables; __str__ method generates a string output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class with an initializer, property getters, and a string representation method. It imports an enumeration for operations but does not execute any dynamic code, network operations, or data leaks. The 'expression' parameter could be user input, but there are no unsafe uses such as eval or insecure data handling. Overall, it appears to be a standard data structure for YAML path collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition for managing YAML path collection terms, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
