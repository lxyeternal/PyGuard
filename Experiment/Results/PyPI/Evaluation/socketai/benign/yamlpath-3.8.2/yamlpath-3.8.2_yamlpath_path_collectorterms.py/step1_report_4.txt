  "purpose": "Defines a class for representing YAML Path collector terms with associated operations and expressions.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading from external sources).",
  "sinks": "None (no output or data leakage points).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow between sources and sinks as no external input/output is processed).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class with properties and a string method. It imports an enum but does not dynamically execute code, evaluate untrusted input, or perform any network or system operations. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent. The code appears to be a straightforward data container with no potential for misuse.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a data structure for YAML path collector terms. No signs of malicious intent or security issues are detected.",
