{
  "purpose": "The code defines a data class 'CollectorTerms' for representing YAML path collection terms, encapsulating an expression string and an operation enum.",
  "sources": "The 'expression' parameter, which is a string input provided during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data in a way that leads to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input 'expression' flows from instantiation to string representation, with no external or dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple data container class with properties for 'expression' and 'operation'. It imports an enum but does not execute dynamic code or perform external actions. No security issues, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The 'expression' parameter could be user input, but it is only stored and formatted, not evaluated or transmitted. All indicators point to benign, straightforward code with no vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data class with no malicious intent or security risks. The provided reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
