  "purpose": "Defines a class for representing YAML Path collector terms with associated operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from yamlpath.enums; class constructor parameters (expression, operation).",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data sinks, system calls, or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (expression, operation) assigned to internal variables; no external flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code appears standard for a data modeling class.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'CollectorTerms' with properties and string representation, using standard Python syntax and type annotations. It imports an enum and manages internal state without executing untrusted data or performing system actions. There are no apparent security issues, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation. No external data flows, no dynamic execution, or unsafe operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data class for managing YAML Path collection terms. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely as a container for data with no malicious intent or security threats.",
