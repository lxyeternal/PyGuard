  "purpose": "Defines a class for YAML Path Collector terms, allowing instantiation with an expression and an operation.",
  "sources": "Import from yamlpath.enums; class constructor parameters: expression and operation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no system or network calls; no handling of external data sources.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (expression, operation) assigned to internal variables; __str__ method formats output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious strings. No dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a simple data container class with properties and a string representation. It imports an enum, uses standard class and property patterns, and contains no external system interactions, network calls, or dangerous code. The class is straightforward and appears solely for data handling with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign class definition for handling YAML path collection terms. No malicious or security risks are present.",
