  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'yamlpath', defining metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static configuration data within setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input, no data leaks, no network activity.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard practices, no obfuscated or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file, specifies package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and CLI entry points. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Dependencies are standard and appropriate. The code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could be malicious. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0. The static and declarative nature of the script confirms its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no security concerns. All evidence and multiple expert reviews support that it poses no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
