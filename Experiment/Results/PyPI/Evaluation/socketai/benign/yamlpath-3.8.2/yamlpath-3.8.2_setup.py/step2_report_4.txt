  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is a standard setup.py script.\n- Finds no malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscated code.\n- Assigns malware=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also states it's a typical setup script, with no suspicious behaviors.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious activity detected.\n- Assigns malware=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The script is standard packaging code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar conclusion: standard setup.py, no signs of malicious activity.\n- No network calls, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- Malware=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same reasoning: standard package configuration, no anomalies.\n- No suspicious code or data flows.\n- Malware=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Repeats the same conclusion: legitimate setup script, no malicious behavior.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- Malware=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a typical, benign setup script for packaging a Python project.\n- No suspicious code, no external data flows, no obfuscation, no malware activity.\n- The dependencies are standard and appropriate.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code content.\n- The confidence levels are high, which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks evident.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard Python package setup script with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
