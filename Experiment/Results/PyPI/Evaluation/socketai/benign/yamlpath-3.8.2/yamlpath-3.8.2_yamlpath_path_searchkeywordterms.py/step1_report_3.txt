{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for representing and parsing search keyword terms with parameters for YAML path search operations.",
  "sources": "The constructor (__init__) receives parameters; the 'parameters' property reads the '_parameters' attribute and parses it; the string representation (__str__) uses internal attributes.",
  "sinks": "There are no external sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution functions. No use of eval, exec, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the '_parameters' attribute, then are parsed by the 'parameters' property, resulting in a list of parameters. The 'str' method uses internal attributes for output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. The parsing logic is complex but standard for handling quoted strings and delimiters; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The class encapsulates search term data with parsing logic for parameters. The parsing handles escaped characters, nested quotes, and comma-separated values. No external data or environment variables are used. No code injection, data leakage, or insecure operations are present. The code appears straightforward and adheres to typical parsing routines without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a parameter parser for search terms with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any network, file, or system operations, and no malicious patterns are evident.",
