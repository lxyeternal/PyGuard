  "purpose": "Defines a class for handling search keyword terms in YAML path expressions, including parsing of parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the __init__ method (inverted, keyword, parameters), and the parameters string property.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe usage of the 'parameters' string that is parsed into a list; no direct sinks like network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'parameters' string flows through the parameter property, where it is parsed into a list of parameters based on delimiters and string demarcations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The parsing logic handles escape characters and mismatched delimiters properly. No obfuscated code features detected. No suspicious external calls or data exfiltration code identified.",
  "analysis": "The class primarily encapsulates search term data and parses a string of parameters into a list. The parsing logic considers string delimiters, escape sequences, and whitespace. It raises an error on mismatched delimiters. No external or dangerous operations are performed; the code is straightforward and focused on string processing. No malware signatures or malicious behavior are apparent. The code does not contain obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate component for handling search keywords with robust parameter parsing. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The only notable feature is the parsing logic which is safe and standard.",
