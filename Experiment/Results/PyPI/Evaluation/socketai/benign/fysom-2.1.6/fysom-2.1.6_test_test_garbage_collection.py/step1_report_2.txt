{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the fysom finite state machine library, specifically testing garbage collection and callback functionality.",
  "sources": "Reading class attributes, method calls, gc.get_objects(), and library imports.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into class attributes and method invocations; no external or untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code is strictly for testing the FSM's memory management and callback integrity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines unit tests to ensure that the fysom FSM implementation does not create circular references that impede garbage collection and that callback functions are correctly invoked. The tests create objects with FSMs, attach callback methods, invoke FSM events, and verify object cleanup. No network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is detected. The code is well-structured, utilizing standard Python testing patterns, and appears solely for testing purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of unit tests aimed at verifying garbage collection and callback functionality in a FSM library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious data flows.",
