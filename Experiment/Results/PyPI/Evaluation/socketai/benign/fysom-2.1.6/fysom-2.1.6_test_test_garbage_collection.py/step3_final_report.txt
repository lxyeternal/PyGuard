  "purpose": "Unit tests for the fysom FSM library, focusing on garbage collection and callback integrity.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of FSM objects, assignment of callback functions, state transition triggers, and gc.get_objects() for cleanup verification.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data flow or malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "FSM creation -> callback invocation -> garbage collection checks; no external or untrusted data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward unit testing for FSM behavior, ensuring no circular references hinder garbage collection and that callbacks execute correctly. It involves creating FSM instances, assigning simple callback methods, triggering state transitions, and verifying cleanup via gc. No network activity, external inputs, or dynamic code execution are present. The code's purpose is purely for internal testing, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for internal testing of FSM garbage collection and callback mechanisms. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The high confidence in this assessment is supported by the straightforward nature of the code and the absence of suspicious patterns.",
