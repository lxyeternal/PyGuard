  "purpose": "Unit tests for the fysom finite state machine library focusing on garbage collection and callback behavior.",
  "sources": "Input data includes hardcoded FSM configuration, callback functions, and object states.",
  "sinks": "Callback functions that modify object state; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks detected.",
  "flows": "FSM events trigger callback functions that append state strings; no data flow involving untrusted sources to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual or suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no network operations or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines unittest classes that instantiate a finite state machine (Fysom) with fixed configurations and callbacks. The tests primarily check for proper garbage collection and callback execution. All data and functions are internal, with no input/output operations or network activity. No malicious behaviors, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The code adheres to typical testing practices without any suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of unit tests for a FSM library, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It neither reads untrusted data nor performs harmful actions. The code is benign and focused on verifying object lifecycle and callback execution.",
