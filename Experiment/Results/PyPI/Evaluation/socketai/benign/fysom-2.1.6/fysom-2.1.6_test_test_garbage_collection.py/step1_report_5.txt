{
  "purpose": "The code defines unittests for the Fysom finite state machine library, focusing on garbage collection and callback behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, method calls, and configuration data for FSM setup.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data flows to cause data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input data (FSM configuration and callback assignments) flow through object instantiations and method calls, with no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting of unit tests for FSM behavior and garbage collection. It imports only standard libraries and a local module. The FSM is configured with fixed data, and callbacks are simple methods that record state changes. There is no external data input, no network communication, no file manipulation, and no dynamic code execution. The logic is standard testing code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard test code for a FSM library, with no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks identified. It is benign and solely intended for testing internal FSM logic.",
