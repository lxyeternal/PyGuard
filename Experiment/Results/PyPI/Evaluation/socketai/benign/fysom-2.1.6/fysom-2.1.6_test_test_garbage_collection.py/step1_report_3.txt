{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the fysom library, specifically testing garbage collection and callback behavior in the context of finite state machines.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from test method invocations and callback functions; the test inputs are hardcoded within the test methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or untrusted data execution; no external data or untrusted sources are used.",
  "flows": "The flow involves creating objects, configuring state machines, invoking state transitions via methods like warn, clear, panic, and then deleting objects; no untrusted data flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward unit testing logic with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs unit tests on the fysom library, involving object creation, callback registration, and garbage collection checks. It does not include any network operations, file manipulations, or external system interactions. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic is present. The callbacks and state transitions are safe, and there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test suite for fysom, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It solely tests object lifecycle and callback handling, posing no security threat.",
