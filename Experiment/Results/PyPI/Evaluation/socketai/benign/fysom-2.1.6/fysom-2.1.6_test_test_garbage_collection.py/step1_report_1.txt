  "purpose": "Unit tests for garbage collection behavior and callback integrity in the fysom finite state machine implementation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from test cases, class method invocations, and callback assignments.",
  "sinks": "Method calls on the fysom object, callback functions that modify internal state.",
  "flows": "Callback assignments to FSM callbacks, method invocations that trigger state changes and callbacks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code includes standard unit testing practices. No suspicious network, file, or system modification activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit testing on the fysom FSM library, focusing on garbage collection safety and callback execution. It defines test classes that create FSM instances, assign callback functions, and invoke state changes. No evidence of data exfiltration, malicious control flow, or external network activity. Usage of gc module is solely for ensuring object cleanup, not malicious activity. All code appears to be for testing purposes, with no suspicious or malicious patterns present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for unit testing the fysom FSM library's garbage collection and callback handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
