{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the 'Fysom' finite state machine library, verifying state transitions and FSM behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads internal FSM configuration data and method calls ('rest', 'eat') on the 'Fysom' object.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; the code only performs internal state assertions.",
  "flows": "Source: FSM configuration and method calls; Sink: Internal state changes and assertions within the test methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python unittest suite testing FSM transitions with no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It uses external 'Fysom' class assumed to be legitimate. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's logic is clear, and the tests are deterministic. All signals indicate benign, safe code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward set of unit tests for an FSM library, and all signals confirm its safety.",
