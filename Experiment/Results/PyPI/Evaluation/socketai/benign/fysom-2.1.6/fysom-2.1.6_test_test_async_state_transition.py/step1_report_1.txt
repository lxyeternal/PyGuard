{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit testing suite for a Python implementation of a finite state machine called Fysom, used to test state transitions and callbacks.",
  "sources": "Imports unittest, Fysom, and FysomError from the fysom module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code performs internal state management and callback invocations without external data handling.",
  "flows": "No external input flows directly into untrusted sinks; internal method calls trigger state transitions and callback executions within the test framework.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code strictly defines test cases for FSM behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard testing libraries and the Fysom FSM class, defining a test class with methods that test FSM state transitions and callback behavior. The FSM is configured with predefined states and callbacks, which are invoked during tests. No external data is read from files, networks, or environment variables. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is solely to verify FSM logic, and no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite for a finite state machine implementation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and intentionally designed for testing FSM functionalities.",
