  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test suite for an FSM library, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data handling. The high security risk score in one report should be adjusted downward to accurately reflect its low-risk nature. Malware and obfuscation scores are correct at 0. The overall security posture is very low risk, and the code can be considered safe for use."
