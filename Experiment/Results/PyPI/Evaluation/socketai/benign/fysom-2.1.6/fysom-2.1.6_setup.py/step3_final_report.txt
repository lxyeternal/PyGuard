{
  "purpose": "A setup.py script defining a custom install class with inert pre- and post-install hooks for the 'fysom' package.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata; no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; no network or file system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; hooks are inert and do not execute any code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder methods that do nothing; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with a custom install class containing empty methods. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious behavior is present. The hooks are inert, serving as placeholders for potential future customization. The static metadata is benign. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (0 or 0.1). The minimal risk score accounts for the presence of hooks that could be misused if modified, but as-is, they pose no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with inert hooks, posing no security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
