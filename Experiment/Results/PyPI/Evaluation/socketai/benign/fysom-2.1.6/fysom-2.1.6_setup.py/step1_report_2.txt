{
  "purpose": "Define a setup configuration for the 'fysom' Python package, customizing the install process with pre- and post-install hooks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from setuptools and custom install class; setup() function parameters such as name, version, author details, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function parameters themselves do not execute untrusted code or handle external input; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks indicative of malicious activity; the code primarily sets up package metadata and install hooks without processing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class defines empty pre- and post-install scripts, which do not perform any actions. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports setup tools, defines a subclass of the install command with empty methods, and calls setup() with static metadata. There is no dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious code logic. The install class methods are placeholders and do not execute any commands or scripts. The setup configuration appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It includes a custom install class with empty hooks, which do not introduce security concerns. No anomalies or malicious code detected.",
