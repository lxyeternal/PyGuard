  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package ('fysom') using setuptools.\n- The custom install class defines empty methods (`pre_install_script` and `post_install_script`) that do nothing.\n- No dynamic code, external data handling, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious code, nor does it process untrusted input.\n- The only unusual aspect is the presence of placeholder methods that could be used for future customization but are inert now.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, and the supposed \"issues\" are just empty method definitions, which are benign.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The only minor flaw is that the `pre_install_script` and `post_install_script` methods are defined but do nothing. This could be seen as incomplete or placeholder code, but not malicious or security-critical.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0.0, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0 or very low (0.1 in report 1). Given the code's benign nature, 0 is appropriate. The small 0.1 in report 1 might be overly cautious but acceptable.\n\n### Validity of the reasoning:\n- The reports correctly identify that no malicious or suspicious behavior exists.\n- The presence of empty hooks does not constitute a security risk.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that are not supported by evidence.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- Since all evidence points to a benign setup script, there is no reason to assign higher malware or security risk scores.\n- The risk score of 0 or 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign setup script with placeholder methods that do not execute any code. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
