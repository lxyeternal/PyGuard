{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'fysom', intended to facilitate installation and distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package metadata, author information, URL, and configuration parameters within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; the script mainly defines static configuration for packaging.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily executes static setup configuration without dynamic input handling.",
  "anomalies": "The methods pre_install_script() and post_install_script() are defined but contain no implementation, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools mechanisms for packaging, defining a custom install class that calls empty pre- and post-install methods. The overall structure is typical for a Python package setup script. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The only notable aspect is the placeholder methods that could be used for custom behavior, but currently, they are inert.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign setup script for packaging a Python project, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The custom install class does not execute any malicious code, and the configuration parameters are typical for such scripts.",
