  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a standard setup.py script for a Python package.\n- It defines a custom install class with empty methods `pre_install_script()` and `post_install_script()`.\n- The setup() call is static, with no dynamic or external data processing.\n- No data sinks, network activity, or malicious code is present.\n- The hooks are inert, serving as placeholders.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes the code correctly.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** The empty hooks are noted; no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; benign setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0.0, Security Risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.1) seems reasonable, given the inert hooks and benign code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or dangerous flows.\n- **Anomalies:** Empty methods, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; standard benign setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The zero scores are justified; no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- Same pattern; accurate, benign, inert hooks.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- Similar analysis; inert hooks, static data.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- Same reasoning; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign, standard setup script with inert hooks.\n- The malware score is consistently 0.0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscation score is 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- The security risk scores are very low or zero, which is appropriate.\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the inert hooks and static setup, a score of 0 or very close to it is justified.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a harmless setup script with placeholder hooks.",
