{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'fysom' Python package, including custom install commands.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'setuptools' and the custom 'install' class definition; the main block calling 'setup()'.",
  "sinks": "The 'setup()' function parameters; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets package metadata and custom installation behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class defines empty 'pre_install_script' and 'post_install_script' methods, which could be placeholders or indicate incomplete implementation, but do not perform any malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setuptools modules and defines a subclass of the install command with no operational code in its methods. The 'setup()' function is called with static metadata and no dynamic or malicious code. There are no input reading, data leakage, or suspicious behaviors such as network activity, file manipulation, or credential handling. The empty script methods suggest potential hooks for customization but are currently inert.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with a custom install command template. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The code appears benign, with no indications of supply chain attacks or malicious intent.",
