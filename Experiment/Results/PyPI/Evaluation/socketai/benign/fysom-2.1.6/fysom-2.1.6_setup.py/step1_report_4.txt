{
  "purpose": "Define and set up the 'fysom' Python package with custom installation steps.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata for package setup, including author info and dependencies; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute dangerous commands.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sensitive operations; the custom install class methods are placeholders and do not perform actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of empty methods 'pre_install_script' and 'post_install_script' suggests potential hooks for custom code, but currently do nothing. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py file using setuptools for packaging a Python project. It defines a custom install class inheriting from setuptools' install command, overriding run() to call placeholder methods. All data used in setup is static metadata; no dynamic or external inputs are processed. No malicious or suspicious code, such as network calls, file manipulations, or obfuscated code, is present. The placeholders might be for future custom logic, but as-is, they do not pose any security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The placeholder methods are benign and do not execute harmful actions.",
