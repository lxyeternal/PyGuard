{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for the 'fysom' Python package, customizing the installation process by adding pre- and post-installation hooks.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'setuptools' and 'setuptools.command.install', the class 'install', and the 'setup' function call with various metadata parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct data sinks that process untrusted data or perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "The flow involves executing pre-install and post-install scripts around the standard installation process, but both are empty, thus no data flows are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The methods 'pre_install_script' and 'post_install_script' are defined but do nothing; no malicious or suspicious code is present. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, extending the 'install' command with empty hooks. The hooks do not execute any commands or scripts, which could have been suspicious if they contained code. All metadata appears benign and typical for a package setup. No external data sources, network calls, or system modifications are present. The structure and content are consistent with common setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical, benign package setup script with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The empty hooks do not pose any risk. Overall, it is safe based on this review.",
