{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for a finite state machine implementation (Fysom) in Python, verifying behavior of the FSM in different states.",
  "sources": "The code reads test data from hardcoded dictionary objects defining FSM configurations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input or produce outputs that affect external systems.",
  "flows": "The test cases create FSM instances, invoke methods like 'warn' and 'panic', and check the FSM's 'is_finished' state; no external data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code follows standard Python unittest practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a unittest module and the Fysom class, then defines test cases to verify FSM behavior. It constructs FSMs with specific configurations, then asserts their state transitions and 'is_finished' status. No external inputs, network activity, or potentially malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and typical for unit testing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for a finite state machine implementation. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, no external data handling, and no security risks. It is safe and functionally intended for testing FSM logic.",
