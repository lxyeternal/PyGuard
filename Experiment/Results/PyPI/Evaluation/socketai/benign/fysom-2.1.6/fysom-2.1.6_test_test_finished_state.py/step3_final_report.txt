{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the 'fysom' finite state machine library, verifying FSM behavior through predefined configurations and method calls.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded FSM configuration data within the test cases.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network, or untrusted input processing; internal method calls only.",
  "flows": "Method invocations like 'warn()', 'panic()', and 'is_finished()' on FSM instances, with no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors; straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests that instantiate FSMs with static configurations and verify state transitions and 'finished' status. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is well-structured, clear, and does not contain any malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test suite for the 'fysom' FSM library, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
