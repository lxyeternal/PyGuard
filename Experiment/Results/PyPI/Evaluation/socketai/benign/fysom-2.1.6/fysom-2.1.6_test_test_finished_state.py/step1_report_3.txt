{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for a Python implementation of a finite state machine (Fysom), used to verify the behavior of FSMs in different scenarios.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded dictionaries used to initialize Fysom objects and method calls like fsm.warn(), fsm.panic().",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any untrusted data sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input data (FSM configurations and method calls) flow into the Fysom class for state transitions; no external untrusted data flows into the code or affects behavior externally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors such as obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden data leaks are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unittest-based test suite for the Fysom FSM implementation. It initializes FSMs with hardcoded state configurations, then calls transition methods to verify FSM states. There are no indications of malicious activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The code is clean, uses standard Python unittest framework, and does not include external or untrusted inputs. All operations are local and predictable, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for verifying FSM behavior. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe testing script.",
