{
  "purpose": "To provide a unit test for the Fysom finite state machine library, ensuring Unicode literals do not cause errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded strings within the test case and the Fysom constructor arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or written; no data leaks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (state names and events) flow from hardcoded literals into the Fysom constructor, but these are static and safe.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing framework and the Fysom class, then defines a unit test to verify Unicode literal handling. The test creates an FSM with predefined states and events, catching potential TypeError exceptions. There is no dynamic code execution, external network activity, or credential management. The code is straightforward and appears to be a standard unit test for library compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test for the Fysom library, testing Unicode literal support. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
