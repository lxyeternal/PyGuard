  "purpose": "Unit testing for the fysom library to ensure compatibility with Unicode literals in Python 2/3",
  "sources": "The code reads a dictionary defining a finite state machine configuration, and the import statements",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or malicious payloads are present",
  "flows": "The configuration dictionary is used to instantiate the Fysom object within a test case",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a unit test that creates an instance of Fysom with a specific state machine configuration. It imports the fysom library and uses unicode literals compatibility. The code structure and logic are standard for unit testing. No external data inputs, network connections, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code appears to be a simple test case aimed at verifying Unicode handling without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test designed to verify Unicode literal support in the fysom FSM library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
