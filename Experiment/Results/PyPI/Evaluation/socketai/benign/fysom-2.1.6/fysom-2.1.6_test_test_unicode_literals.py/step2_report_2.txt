  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple, straightforward unit test verifying Unicode literal handling in the 'fysom' FSM library.\n- The code involves no dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- The purpose is clearly to test Unicode compatibility, not to perform any malicious actions.\n\n**Code confirmation:**\n- The code matches the description: it imports 'unittest' and 'fysom', creates a test case class, and instantiates a 'Fysom' object with a configuration dictionary containing Unicode strings.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or supply chain attacks.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence levels:** High (1.0 or 0.9), appropriate for the clear, straightforward analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the scores reflect the actual risk level.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, standard unit test verifying Unicode literal handling.\n- No malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or security risks are present.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Justification:** The code is a simple, harmless unit test with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or score adjustments are needed.",
