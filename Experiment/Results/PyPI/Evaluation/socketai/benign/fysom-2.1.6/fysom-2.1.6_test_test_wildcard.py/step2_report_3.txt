  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward implementation and test suite for a FSM using the fysom library, including wildcard transitions.\n- The code is mainly configuration data, class definitions, and test methods.\n- No evidence of malicious code, external data handling, or suspicious behavior is found.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, emphasizing the benign nature of the code.\n- They correctly note the absence of obfuscation, external network calls, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- No logical flaws or security issues are apparent in the analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- No adjustments seem necessary based on the evidence.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since the code contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or vulnerabilities, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The highest confidence is that the code is safe, so a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate malware scores**\n\n- All reports assign malware score = 0, which is correct.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, so this score remains at 0.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely for FSM testing.\n- No assumptions about hidden vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent with the code.\n\n**Step 7: Ensure score consistency**\n\n- The scores across reports are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a standard FSM implementation and test suite, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security flaws. All analyses confirm its benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, standard, and intended solely for FSM testing.  \n- No changes to the reported scores are necessary.  \n- The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep all scores at 0 for malware and risk, with confidence at 0.9 or higher.",
