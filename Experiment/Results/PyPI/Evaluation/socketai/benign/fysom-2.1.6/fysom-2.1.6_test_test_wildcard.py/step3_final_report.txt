  "purpose": "Test suite for FSM with wildcard transitions using the fysom library.",
  "sources": "Configuration data within the test class and FSM initialization code.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal FSM state transitions.",
  "flows": "FSM configuration flows into state transition methods within tests.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward test code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for a FSM library, focusing on wildcard transition behavior. It imports from well-known modules, defines FSM configurations, and runs assertions. No external data, network activity, or malicious code is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and typical for testing FSMs. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard testing code for FSM behavior, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
