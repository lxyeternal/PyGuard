{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for a finite state machine implementation ('fysom'), defining states and transitions for testing wildcard transitions.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'fysom' library and 'test_many_to_many' module; input data from test cases and FSM configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted input or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flow; the FSM configuration and test methods process predefined data without external input or insecure handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be standard test code for FSM behavior with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a FSM class and a test module, then defines a subclass with FSM configuration. The FSM uses a standard pattern with initial state and transition definitions, including a wildcard transition ('*'). The test methods simulate state changes based on predefined events. No untrusted input handling, external data sources, or risky operations are present. The code strictly serves as a test suite for FSM functionality, without any signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for FSM behavior with no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security issues. It solely defines and tests state transitions using predefined data.",
