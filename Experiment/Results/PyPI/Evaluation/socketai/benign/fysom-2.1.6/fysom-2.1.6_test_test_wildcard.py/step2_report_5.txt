  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning provided, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of unit tests for a FSM implementation (`fysom`), focusing on wildcard transitions.\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, uses well-known modules, and contains no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- No external data, network calls, or secret handling is present.\n- The code appears to be purely for testing FSM behavior, with no indication of supply chain or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**1. Purpose and Sources:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is for testing FSM transitions, including wildcards.\n- The sources are mainly imports from `fysom` and a test module, with configuration data embedded.\n\n**2. Sinks and Flows:**\n\n- No external data sinks or outputs, no untrusted data handling.\n- Data flows are internal, from configuration to FSM execution.\n\n**3. Anomalies:**\n\n- No obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or anomalies.\n- Use of wildcards in FSM transitions is standard and not inherently malicious.\n\n**4. Analysis:**\n\n- All reports correctly interpret the code as standard test code.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues.\n- The code is consistent with typical unit tests for FSMs.\n\n**5. Conclusions:**\n\n- All reports confidently assert the code's benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, justified as the code is purely for testing FSM behavior with no external effects or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n\n- No reason exists to assign higher scores; the code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, safe test suite for FSM transitions, including wildcard handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain issues, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The scores provided in the reports are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
