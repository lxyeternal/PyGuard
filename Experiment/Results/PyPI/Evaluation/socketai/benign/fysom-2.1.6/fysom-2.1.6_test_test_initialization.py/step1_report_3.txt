{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the Fysom finite state machine implementation in Python, aimed at verifying its behavior with various configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration dictionaries passed to the Fysom class constructor and calls methods on Fysom instances.",
  "sinks": "Method calls on Fysom instances (e.g., fsm.warn(), fsm.calm(), fsm.tic()), which could trigger state changes or callbacks. No direct data sinks that leak data externally are present.",
  "flows": "Sources include configuration data and method invocations. Flows lead from initial configuration through method calls that change state and invoke callbacks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code is straightforward unit testing code.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively defines unit tests for the Fysom FSM class, importing the class and exercising its API with various configurations. No dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or network activity is present. The tests verify FSM behaviors such as initial states, transitions, callbacks, and configuration overrides. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed. The code appears to be legitimate test code for a known FSM implementation with no signs of sabotage, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of unit tests for a finite state machine library. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. There are no anomalies or obfuscated code; the code is safe and intended solely for testing purposes.",
