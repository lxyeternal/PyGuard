{
  "purpose": "This code is a set of unit tests for the 'fysom' finite state machine library, verifying its configuration and behavior under various scenarios.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from dictionaries and tuples to initialize FSM instances, and invokes methods like 'warn', 'panic', 'calm', 'clear', etc.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data sinks or outputs; all data flows are internal within the test environment, with no network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources (configuration data) are used to initialize FSM objects, which then invoke methods that change internal state; no external or untrusted data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test suite for the 'fysom' FSM library, performing configuration, method calls, and assertions without external data or malicious behavior. No obfuscation, network activity, or security risks are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal. The reasoning is consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured test code with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores accurately reflect its safe nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
