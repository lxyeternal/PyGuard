{
  "purpose": "The code defines a unit test suite for the Fysom finite state machine library, testing various configuration scenarios and behaviors.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the dictionary arguments provided to the Fysom constructor, such as 'initial' state, 'events', and 'callbacks'. The test functions also invoke methods on the Fysom instances.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send untrusted data externally. It mainly calls methods and performs assertions locally. No external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "The source data (configuration dictionaries, method calls) flow into the Fysom constructor, which sets up the FSM. Method calls like fsm.warn() or fsm.panic() transition states based on the configured rules, but no untrusted data is sent outside.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or hidden behaviors are present. The code appears straightforward, using standard unittest patterns and explicit configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard test suite for a Python FSM library, including multiple test cases for configuration options, initial states, event handling, callbacks, and completion states. No code injection, external data manipulation, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or system modifications that could be malicious. The only data flows are input configurations and method invocations within the test context, with no external or suspicious data handling. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors. The overall structure and content indicate legitimate testing of an FSM library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test suite for the Fysom finite state machine library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and non-malicious.",
