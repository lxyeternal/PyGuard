{
  "purpose": "The source code implements a finite state machine (FSM) framework in Python, allowing definition and triggering of states and transitions, with support for callbacks and event handling.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (functools, weakref, types, sys, collections.abc), defines constants (WILDCARD, SAME_DST), class definitions (__author__, __copyright__, __credits__, __license__, __version__, __maintainer__, __email__), and functions/methods for FSM operations including event triggers, state checks, and callbacks.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink points include dynamic method creation (e.g., _build_event), callback invocation (_do_callbacks), and use of setattr to register methods dynamically. No direct untrusted data inputs, environment variables, or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Code flow involves initializing FSM configurations, setting up event handlers, and invoking callback methods via dynamically created functions. Calls like getattr(self, event) and self._map[event] access state data, with callback functions executed during state changes and events.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains dynamic method creation (_build_event) and the use of weak references for callback functions, which are standard for flexible event systems. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL/network operations, or backdoors are detected. Use of 'basestring' with exception handling indicates compatibility for Python 2 and 3, not obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a robust FSM framework with clear separation of concerns: event handling, state transitions, and callback execution. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system manipulation. The use of weak references for callbacks and dynamic method assignment is typical for plugin-like architectures. No suspicious or hidden code patterns are identified. The code appears to be a standard, open-source FSM implementation with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This Python FSM code is legitimate, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard FSM operations, callback management, and event handling. There are no indicators of malware, security breaches, or sabotage within this module.",
