{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the Fysom finite state machine library, verifying state transitions and event handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from test methods and the 'Fysom' class configuration during setup.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leakage or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from test inputs through method calls to state transition methods like 'warn', 'panic', 'calm', and 'trigger', but all are within controlled test scenarios.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. Usage of unittest framework is standard, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a testing suite for a finite state machine library, with no evidence of external data sources or untrusted input handling. The import statements are standard, and the test cases simply verify state transitions and event handling. No code injection, data exfiltration, network activity, or other malicious behaviors are present. The code is well-structured, straightforward, and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of unit tests for a state machine library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not read untrusted input beyond test parameters, does not write to external systems, and contains no malware indicators.",
