{
  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data read from code variables, environment variables, or external inputs; code execution points such as eval, exec, or network calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or system commands that could be exploited or indicate malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or system modifications), potentially via unsafe or malicious code paths.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of incomplete code, missing functions, lack of suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, or absence of malicious indicators; minimal anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports acknowledge incomplete or absent code, with cautious assessments. No suspicious functions, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are observed. Confidence levels vary based on code completeness, with low to high confidence assigned appropriately. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero across all reports, with minor security risk scores (~0.2) reflecting uncertainty due to incomplete data. The reasoning is consistent, and no evidence of malicious activity is found.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information, the dependency appears benign with no detected malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate given the limited data. Continued monitoring and requesting complete code snippets are recommended for thorough security assessment.",
