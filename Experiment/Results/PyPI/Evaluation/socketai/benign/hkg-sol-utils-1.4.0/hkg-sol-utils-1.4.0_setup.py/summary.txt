  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious or suspicious supply chain activity, primarily due to network activity and silent operations during setup. While no definitive malicious payload is present, the suspicious domain contact and unvalidated commands justify a moderate to high security concern. The malware likelihood is moderate to high, and the overall risk warrants further investigation, including domain reputation checks and source validation."
