  "analysis": "The code is a trivial import statement with no operational logic, data processing, or malicious patterns. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The minimal code suggests a placeholder or incomplete snippet. The absence of data flows or untrusted inputs indicates no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity or security concerns. The minimal import and empty comment do not pose any threat or security risk.",
