  "analysis": "The code is extremely minimal, consisting solely of an import statement and a comment line. The 'import os' statement itself is common and not malicious. No data input, output, or control flow exists. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The comment is empty and adds no suspicious context. Overall, the code does not demonstrate any malicious intent or security risks.",
