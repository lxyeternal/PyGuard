{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for drawing boundary lines, gridlines, and tick marks on a matplotlib plot representing a simplex diagram.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters such as 'ax', 'scale', 'ticks', 'locations', 'permutation', and configuration dictionaries like 'axes_colors'. It also uses imported functions 'project_point' and 'arange'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs graphical elements onto a matplotlib Axes object, including lines and text labels. No data is transmitted over networks or stored.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., 'ax', 'scale') influence the drawing of lines and text on the plot, with functions passing parameters through to matplotlib drawing routines; there are no untrusted data flows outside visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. The code strictly performs plotting tasks with standard matplotlib and numpy functions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various functions to plot lines, boundaries, gridlines, and tick labels on a matplotlib plot representing a simplex. It uses standard libraries 'numpy' and 'matplotlib', and imports a helper function 'project_point'. The functions perform geometric calculations to determine line positions, then add lines and text to the axes. There are no network operations, system calls, or data exfiltration routines. No obfuscation techniques or hidden code patterns are present. The code appears to be straightforward plotting logic for visualization purposes. It handles input parameters, merges configuration dictionaries, and applies formatting to tick labels in a typical manner. Overall, the code demonstrates standard plotting functionality with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plotting utility module for visualizing simplexes, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It solely performs graphical rendering tasks, with no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
