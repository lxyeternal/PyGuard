{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate and display heatmaps on simplexes, including triangular, dual-triangular, and hexagonal styles, with support for SVG export and customizable color mapping.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from dictionaries and function outputs; reads configuration parameters such as permutation, style, and color settings.",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib for rendering graphics; writes SVG files directly; applies color mappings based on data values.",
  "flows": "Input data and parameters flow into polygon_generator and heatmap functions, which generate visualizations; data values are mapped to colors and rendered via matplotlib or SVG output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code performs typical data visualization operations with no obscure language features or dynamic code execution. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious network connections, or system damage are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily deals with generating visual representations of heatmaps using standard libraries like numpy and matplotlib. It contains functions for calculating coordinates, blending values, and generating SVG polygons. The code appears well-structured for visualization tasks, with no dynamic code execution, network communication, or data theft mechanisms. No hidden or malicious behavior is evident. The functions are focused on rendering graphics and processing data for visualization, with no suspicious operations observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a visualization utility for heatmaps with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is designed for data display purposes only and does not contain any malware or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is very low.",
