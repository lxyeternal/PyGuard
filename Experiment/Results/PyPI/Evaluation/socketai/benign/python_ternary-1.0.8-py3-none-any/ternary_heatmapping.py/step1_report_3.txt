{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to generate and visualize heatmaps on simplices and hexagons, including SVG export capabilities. It is mainly for visualizing data distributions over these geometric partitions.",
  "sources": "Input data from provided dictionaries or functions, parameters for configuration, and imported helper modules (untrusted if external).",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib plotting functions, SVG file writing, and potential data conversions. No evident sinks involve network or system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source data or function outputs into visualization functions, then into plotting or SVG output functions, with no external network or system manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. No obfuscated code or malicious dynamic execution present. No data leakage or privacy violations evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines geometric calculations for heatmaps and visualizations using standard libraries and helper modules. Functions compute coordinates, blend values, generate polygons, and produce visual output via matplotlib or SVG files. No suspicious network activity, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors are present. The use of helper modules such as 'helpers' and 'colormapping' suggests modular design, with no indication of malicious intent. The code handles data securely within the visualization context and does not process untrusted input beyond data mapping for plotting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward visualization toolkit for heatmaps on simplices and hexagons, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be an open-source visualization utility with no malicious intent.",
