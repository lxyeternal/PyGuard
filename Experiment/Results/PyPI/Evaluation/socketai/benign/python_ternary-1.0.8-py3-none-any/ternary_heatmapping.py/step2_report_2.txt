  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard visualization functions for heatmaps on simplices, using data dictionaries and helper modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Visualization via matplotlib, no external data exfiltration or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; code employs standard visualization techniques.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, code is safe, primarily for visualization.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0.0 — consistent with no malicious activity.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0 — code appears clear.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — very low, justified given the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing visualization, SVG export, and data processing.  \n- No suspicious activity or anomalies.  \n- Slightly lower confidence (0.95), but still consistent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0.0 — no signs of malicious code.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Same general assessment: visualization functions, SVG export, no network or malicious behavior.  \n- Slightly different emphasis but no anomalies.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0.0 — no malware detected.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Focuses on visualization, no suspicious activity, no obfuscation.  \n- Clear data flow and standard visualization routines.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0.0 — safe.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — transparent code.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar conclusions: visualization, SVG export, no malicious activity.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0.0 — no malware.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is clear.  \n- Risk: 0 — very low, justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently assign 0.0, and the code contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious operations.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is straightforward with no obfuscation or misleading constructs.  \n- **Risk Score:** Uniformly low at 0.1 or 0, justified given the purely visualization-focused nature and absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — no signs of malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — code is clear and well-structured.  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, justified, primarily because the code handles visualization and file output but does not involve external data transmission or system commands.\n\n**Note:** Since the code is solely for visualization, with no network, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution, the risk remains very low.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score |\n|----------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware        | 0.0                   |\n| Obfuscated     | 0.0                   |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1                   |\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's functionality.",
