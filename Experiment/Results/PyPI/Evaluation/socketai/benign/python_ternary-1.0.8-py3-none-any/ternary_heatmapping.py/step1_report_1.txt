{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate and visualize heatmaps on simplices, including hexagonal, triangular, and SVG formats, primarily for visualizing data distributions in a geometric simplex.",
  "sources": "Data sources include input dictionaries mapping coordinate keys to values, and function inputs such as 'func' in heatmapf which generate data for visualization. External libraries like numpy and matplotlib are used for data processing and plotting.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include matplotlib's plotting functions (ax.fill, ax.imshow), SVG file writes (file.write), and colormapping functions. These are standard for visualization and do not by themselves pose security risks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (dictionaries, function outputs) into data processing functions, which then generate visualizations via plotting or SVG output, with no evidence of untrusted data being executed or transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code employs standard visualization techniques with no hidden or unusual operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of functions for geometric calculations, data normalization, and plotting. It does not include any network operations, system commands, or data exfiltration. Usage of external libraries is typical for visualization purposes. There is no indication of code injection, backdoors, or malicious data handling. All data flows are from input data or functions to visualization outputs, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard visualization utility for heatmaps on simplices, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears safe for use within its intended purpose.",
