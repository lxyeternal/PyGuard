{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate, visualize, and export heatmaps and polygons on simplexes and hexagons, mainly for data visualization purposes related to heatmaps and triangulations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from provided dictionaries, function inputs, and simplex iterator; reads color mapping functions and helper functions from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib functions to generate plots and save SVG files; no direct data exfiltration or system commands observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data structures through visualization functions, converting values into colors and polygons for display or SVG export; no network or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Usage of external helper modules is standard for visualization; no obfuscated code, misleading variable names, or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data visualization for heatmaps on simplices and hexagons using matplotlib and SVG exports. It includes functions for polygon generation, color mapping, and plotting, all based on standard visualization techniques. No network operations, system commands, or hidden behaviors are present. The functions depend on input data and external libraries for rendering; all data flows are confined to visualization processes. No signs of malicious activity, data theft, or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a standard, well-structured visualization library for heatmaps based on simplex and hexagon geometries. It does not contain malicious or sabotage code, and there are no indicators of malware, unauthorized data exfiltration, or security risks.",
