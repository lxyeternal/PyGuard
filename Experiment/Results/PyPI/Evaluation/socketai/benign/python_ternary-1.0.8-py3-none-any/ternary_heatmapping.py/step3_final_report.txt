{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for generating and visualizing heatmaps on simplices and hexagons, including SVG export, primarily for data visualization purposes using matplotlib and SVG files.",
  "sources": "Input data dictionaries, helper modules, and function parameters providing coordinate and style information.",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib plotting routines and SVG file outputs; no external network or system command execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries or functions through visualization functions, resulting in plotted polygons or SVG elements without external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected; code employs standard visualization techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward visualization utility for heatmaps on simplices and hexagons, with no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation. It uses standard libraries and helper modules for plotting and SVG generation. No signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or sabotage are present. The code's structure and logic are clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured visualization utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It poses minimal security risk, primarily because it only performs local visualization and file output operations. The scores should remain at malware 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk approximately 0.1, reflecting the low inherent risk of visualization code.",
