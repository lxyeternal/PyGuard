{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for generating and plotting various heatmaps (triangular, dual-triangular, hexagonal) on simplices and related structures, including SVG export functionality.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from dictionaries, function parameters, and simplex iterator; reads color mapping functions; reads permutation and style parameters; reads input function in heatmapf.",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib's fill and colorbar functions to generate visualizations; writes SVG polygons to files. No data leaks or external data transmission are observed.",
  "flows": "Data is read from dictionaries or generated via functions, processed for color mapping and geometric coordinates, then visualized through matplotlib or SVG output. No evidence of data flow to untrusted external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, misleading variable names, or dynamic code execution observed. All functions appear consistent with visualization tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically computes geometric coordinates for heatmaps and polygons, applies color mappings, and renders visual outputs. It uses standard libraries (numpy, matplotlib) and external helper functions (imported from local modules). The SVG export function writes static SVG polygons to files based on input data. There are no suspicious network operations, code injections, or privacy violations. The logic is straightforward and aligned with standard visualization techniques. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate visualization library for heatmaps on simplices, with no malicious behavior or sabotage detected. It is consistent with intended functionality for scientific or visualization purposes.",
