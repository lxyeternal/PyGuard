  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured visualization utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It poses minimal security risk, primarily because it only performs local visualization and file output operations. The scores should remain at malware 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk approximately 0.1, reflecting the low inherent risk of visualization code."
