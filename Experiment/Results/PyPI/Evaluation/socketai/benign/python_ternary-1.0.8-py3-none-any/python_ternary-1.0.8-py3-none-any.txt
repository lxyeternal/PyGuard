      "confidence": 1.0,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured visualization utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It poses minimal security risk, primarily because it only performs local visualization and file output operations. The scores should remain at malware 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk approximately 0.1, reflecting the low inherent risk of visualization code."

      "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard mathematical utilities for coordinate transformations and plotting support related to the 2-simplex. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for matplotlib visualization, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The use of user input for colormap names is standard and safe within matplotlib's API. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to minimal potential misuse of user input, which is typical in visualization code."

The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the security risk is negligible. The overall supply chain security risk from this code is minimal."
