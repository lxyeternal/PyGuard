{
  "purpose": "Provides plotting functions for visualizing trajectories, curves, and scatter points with optional color mapping and axis adjustments.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as matplotlib, numpy, and local helper functions; reads data from 'points' parameters in plotting functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib to generate plots and colorbars; does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Receives 'points' data as input; processes and projects this data; renders visual output via matplotlib functions. No data leaves the system.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors; no dynamic execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple plotting functions utilizing standard matplotlib procedures. It handles data projection and visual styling without external data transmission or insecure handling. The functions are well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious side effects. No potentially dangerous behaviors such as network access, file manipulation, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward plotting utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It solely provides visualization functions and does not include any suspicious or harmful operations.",
