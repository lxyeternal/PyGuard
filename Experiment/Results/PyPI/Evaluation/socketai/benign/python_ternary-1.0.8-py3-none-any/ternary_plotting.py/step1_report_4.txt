{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for plotting various types of trajectory data (scatter, line, colored line) using matplotlib, with support for projections, color mapping, and axis adjustments.",
  "sources": "Data is sourced from the input parameter 'points', which are lists of 3-tuples representing coordinates.",
  "sinks": "The code calls plotting functions that render visuals; no direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious activity are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (points) is processed through project_sequence for coordinate transformation, then passed to plotting functions such as ax.plot, ax.scatter, or added as LineCollection objects, culminating in rendering the visualization.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for plotting; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines visualization functions for plotting trajectories and scatter points, with optional coloring and axis adjustments. It imports matplotlib and numpy, uses helper functions for projection and colormap handling, and constructs plots without handling sensitive data or executing untrusted code. No data leaks, code injections, or malicious behaviors are observed. The functions are straightforward and utilize common plotting libraries and methods.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical plotting utility module with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. It is safe and intended for visualizing trajectory data, with no hidden or malicious functionalities.",
