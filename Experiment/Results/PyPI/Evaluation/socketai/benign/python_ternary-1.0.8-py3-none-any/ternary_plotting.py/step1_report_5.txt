{
  "purpose": "The code provides various plotting functions for visualizing 3D trajectory points projected onto 2D, including simple plots, colored trajectories, and scatter plots.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through function parameters, primarily 'points' (lists of 3-tuples). Data is read from these input variables. No external data sources or user inputs are explicitly read in the code.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs visual plots via matplotlib's plotting functions, which display graphics on screen or save images. No direct data leakage or external system calls are present. No untrusted data is written to files or network.",
  "flows": "Input points are projected via 'project_sequence', then passed to matplotlib plotting functions, resulting in visual output. No data flows to external systems or network in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses standard plotting functions and helper imports. No indications of backdoors or malicious code logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple plotting functions that process a list of 3D points, project them onto 2D space, and visualize them using matplotlib. It includes functions for clearing ticks, resizing plots, and plotting with color variations. All operations are standard visualization routines. No suspicious data handling, network activity, or malicious constructs are found. Helper functions like 'project_sequence', 'get_cmap', and 'colorbar_hack' are imported but their implementations are not shown, though their usage appears typical. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plotting utility for visualizing 3D trajectory data in 2D, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates purely on input data and produces visual output without engaging in any suspicious or harmful activities.",
