{
  "purpose": "Provides visualization functions for plotting 3D trajectory data projected onto 2D axes, including scatter plots, line plots, and colored trajectories.",
  "sources": "Input 'points' data (lists of 3-tuples), helper functions 'project_sequence', 'get_cmap', 'colorbar_hack' for projection, colormap, and colorbar handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input points -> projection via 'project_sequence' -> plotting functions (plot, scatter, line collection) -> visualization output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Minor functional note: 'scatter' does not pass 'vmin'/'vmax' to 'ax.scatter()', which may affect colormap scaling but not security.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard matplotlib routines for visualization. No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. Helper functions are imported but not shown; their benign nature is assumed based on context. The code handles input data safely, with no evident vulnerabilities. The security and malware scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign, non-malicious nature of the code. Slightly conservative risk scores (around 0.1) reflect reliance on external helpers but do not indicate actual threats. No obfuscation or malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured visualization utility for plotting 3D trajectory data projected onto 2D space. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
