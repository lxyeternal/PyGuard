  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for matplotlib visualization, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The use of user input for colormap names is standard and safe within matplotlib's API. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to minimal potential misuse of user input, which is typical in visualization code."
