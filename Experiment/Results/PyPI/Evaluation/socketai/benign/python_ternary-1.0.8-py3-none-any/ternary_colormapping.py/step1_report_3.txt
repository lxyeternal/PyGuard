{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for color mapping and colorbar handling in matplotlib visualizations, including colormap selection, value-to-color conversion, and colorbar insertion.",
  "sources": "The code reads the matplotlib version, input parameters to functions (cmap, value, bounds), and uses matplotlib functions to get colormaps and create colorbars.",
  "sinks": "The code calls matplotlib functions such as plt.get_cmap(), plt.colorbar(), and uses rgb2hex to convert RGBA colors to hex strings.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (cmap, value, vmin, vmax) flow through functions get_cmap() and colormapper() to produce color outputs, and colorbar_hack() creates a colorbar for plots.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behavior detected. The code uses standard matplotlib functions without obfuscation or dynamic code execution. The use of _A attribute on ScalarMappable is consistent with matplotlib practices, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions for colormap management and colorbar insertion, relying solely on matplotlib library functions. It conditionally assigns default colormap based on matplotlib version. No untrusted input sources, external network calls, or hidden behaviors are present. The functions perform standard operations for visualization purposes, with no signs of data leakage, malicious code, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for visualization support in matplotlib. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard utility module for color mapping and colorbar handling.",
