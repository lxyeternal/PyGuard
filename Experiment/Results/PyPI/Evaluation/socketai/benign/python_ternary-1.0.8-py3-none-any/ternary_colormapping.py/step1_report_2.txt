{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for colormap handling and colorbar creation in matplotlib visualizations.",
  "sources": "Imports matplotlib and its submodules; uses matplotlib version info to set default colormap.",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib functions such as plt.get_cmap(), plt.colorbar(), and plt.Normalize() which handle visualization rendering but do not perform data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves colormaps based on input or defaults, maps values to colors, and creates colorbars for plots.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected. No network activity, file I/O, or suspicious operations present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for colormap selection and color mapping, relying solely on matplotlib libraries and internal logic. It adjusts default colormap based on matplotlib version. No input/output streams, external data retrieval, or malicious code constructs are present. The functions are standard for plotting tasks and do not exhibit any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for visualization purposes, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
