{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for color mapping and colorbar creation using matplotlib, primarily for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads matplotlib version information, user-provided colormap names, and input values for color mapping.",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib's get_cmap, colorbar, and related functions that could potentially process untrusted input if supplied maliciously.",
  "flows": "User provides 'cmap' string; functions normalize values; get_cmap retrieves colormap; colormapper converts values to colors; colorbar_hack adds colorbar to plot.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the code relies on standard matplotlib functions without obfuscation or suspicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically selects a default colormap based on matplotlib version. It defines functions for obtaining colormaps, mapping values to colors, and creating colorbars. The get_cmap function accepts user input for colormap names, but this is standard usage in matplotlib and does not inherently pose a security risk. The colormapper normalizes input values for color mapping without executing untrusted code. The colorbar_hack function creates visual elements with standard matplotlib procedures. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The code's operations are typical for visualization tasks, with no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard matplotlib visualization utilities with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does utilize user-supplied colormap names, but this is normal for flexible visualization libraries and does not constitute malicious activity.",
