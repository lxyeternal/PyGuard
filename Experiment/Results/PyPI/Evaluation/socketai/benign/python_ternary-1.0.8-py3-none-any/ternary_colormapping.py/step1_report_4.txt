{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for color mapping and colorbar manipulation in matplotlib visualizations.",
  "sources": "The code reads the matplotlib version, input parameters for colormap names and values, and data for color normalization.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources, send data over the network, or perform any sensitive data leakage.",
  "flows": "Input parameters such as cmap, value, vmin, vmax flow into functions that generate color mappings and colorbars, but there are no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. The functions are standard matplotlib utilities without obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious side-effects.",
  "analysis": "The code imports matplotlib libraries, defines functions for retrieving colormaps, mapping values to colors, and adding colorbars to plots. The functions handle standard operations such as input validation, normalization, and formatting for visualization purposes. The version check adjusts default colormap choices based on matplotlib version, which is a benign compatibility handling. No code performs network access, data exfiltration, or system modification. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for color mapping in matplotlib visualizations. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk score is very low, and there are no indications of malware.",
