{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for matplotlib colormap handling and colorbar insertion in plots.",
  "sources": "User-supplied colormap name strings, matplotlib version info, input parameters for functions",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib functions that generate color mappings and colorbars, no data leaks or external data handling",
  "flows": "Input parameters (cmap, values, normalization) flow into matplotlib functions like get_cmap, ScalarMappable, and colorbar",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, standard matplotlib utility functions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for retrieving colormaps, mapping values to colors, and inserting colorbars. It uses version checks to set default colormap names, accepts user input for colormap selection, and employs matplotlib's API safely. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no external data handling or network activity. The functions perform expected visualization tasks without obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for matplotlib visualization, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The use of user input for colormap names is standard and safe within matplotlib's API. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to minimal potential misuse of user input, which is typical in visualization code.",
