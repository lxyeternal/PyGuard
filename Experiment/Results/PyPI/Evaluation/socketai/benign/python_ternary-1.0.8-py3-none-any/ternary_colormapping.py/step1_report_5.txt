{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for color mapping and colorbar creation using Matplotlib, primarily for visualizations such as heatmaps and ternary plots.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function parameters (values, colormap names, plotting axes) and the Matplotlib library for colormap and plotting functionalities.",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib functions such as get_cmap, colorbar, and Normalize for visualization; no data is sent over network or stored.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (values, colormap names) flow into functions, which process them to generate colors or colorbars within the plotting context.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard plotting libraries, checks Matplotlib version for default colormap selection, and defines functions for retrieving colormaps, mapping values to colors, and adding colorbars. The functions perform straightforward data normalization and visualization tasks using well-documented Matplotlib features. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or external data leaks are present. The code is focused solely on visualization utilities without any network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate visualization utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard library functions for color mapping and visualization, with no suspicious anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
