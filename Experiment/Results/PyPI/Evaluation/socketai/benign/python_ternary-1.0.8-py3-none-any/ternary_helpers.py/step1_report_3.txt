  "purpose": "Utility functions for projecting to the simplex, normalizing data, and plotting in ternary coordinates.",
  "sources": "Input data points in functions like project_point, project_sequence, convert_coordinates, and convert_coordinates_sequence.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that involve untrusted data leading to data leaks or system effects. No network or file I/O operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data points are transformed through permutation, projection, and coordinate conversion functions for plotting purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code performs standard mathematical transformations and data normalization without unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides geometric transformations and plotting utilities for 2D and 3D simplex (ternary) plots. Functions are straightforward and use numpy for calculations. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No network calls, file I/O, or environmental variable manipulations are present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The functions handle data normalization, permutation, projection, and coordinate conversion with standard mathematical operations, which are safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for mathematical and plotting operations related to the simplex. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. The likelihood of malware or security risks is very low.",
