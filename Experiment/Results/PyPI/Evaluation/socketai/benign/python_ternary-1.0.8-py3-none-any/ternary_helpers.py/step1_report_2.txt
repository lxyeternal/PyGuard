{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for projecting points onto a 2D simplex, normalizing data, iterating through simplex lattice points, and coordinate transformations for plotting purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads include sum() for normalization, list(zip()) in unzip(), and numpy functions. No external input sources detected; code operates on provided data structures.",
  "sinks": "Uses numpy for calculations, no data output or network transmission observed. No sinks that could leak data or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Input data (coordinates, lists) processed through permutation, normalization, projection, and coordinate conversions; no external communication or data exfiltration points present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Functions follow standard mathematical procedures for geometry and plotting; no unusual behavior or hidden logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises mathematical utilities for working with points on a 2D simplex, including projection, normalization, iteration over lattice points, and coordinate transformation for plotting. All functions perform straightforward, well-understood calculations without external side effects or malicious behavior. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious network activity. The code is structured and commented clearly, and no anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for geometric and plotting operations related to simplexes. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It is safe for use, with no security risks identified.",
