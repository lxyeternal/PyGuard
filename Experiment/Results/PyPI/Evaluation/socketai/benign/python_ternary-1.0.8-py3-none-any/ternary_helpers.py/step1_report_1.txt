  "purpose": "Utility functions for projecting points onto a 2-simplex, including coordinate transformations, normalization, and iteration over simplex points.",
  "sources": "Input data can come from function parameters such as lists, tuples, or sequences of points (e.g., 'unzip', 'normalize', 'simplex_iterator', 'project_point', 'planar_to_coordinates', 'project_sequence', 'convert_coordinates', 'get_conversion', 'convert_coordinates_sequence').",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the 'convert_coordinates' and 'project_point' functions that perform coordinate transformations, but they process data rather than executing untrusted code or executing external commands. No direct network communication, file writing, or command execution is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input points through coordinate transformations ('project_point', 'planar_to_coordinates', 'convert_coordinates') and iteration ('simplex_iterator') to produce projected points or sequences for plotting. No untrusted data is used in a way that leads to external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors such as obfuscated logic, dynamic code execution, or hardcoded secrets. The code strictly implements mathematical transformations and iteration routines, typical for visualization utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of mathematical utility functions for working with points in a 2-simplex: normalizing lists, iterating over lattice points, permuting and projecting 3D coordinates to 2D, converting between coordinate systems, and preparing data for plotting. There are no network calls, file operations, or external command executions. All functions perform deterministic mathematical calculations and data transformations. No anomalies or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of utility functions for geometric and coordinate transformations related to the simplex. It appears to be standard, mathematical, visualization support code without malicious intent or behavior. No security risks or malware are identified.",
