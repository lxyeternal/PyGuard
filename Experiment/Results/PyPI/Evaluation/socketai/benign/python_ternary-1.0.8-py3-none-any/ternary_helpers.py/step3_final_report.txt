  "purpose": "Utility functions for projecting points onto the simplex, coordinate transformations, normalization, iteration over lattice points, and plotting support for the 2-simplex (ternary plots).",
  "sources": "Input data points (3-tuples) for projection, normalization, and coordinate conversion functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or file I/O; data transformations are internal and deterministic.",
  "flows": "Input points are permuted, projected onto planar coordinates, or converted between coordinate systems within the functions without external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward mathematical utilities with clear structure.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of functions for normalization, iteration over lattice points, coordinate permutation, projection to planar coordinates, and conversion between coordinate systems. All operations are mathematical, deterministic, and involve no external system calls, network activity, or data leaks. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present. The functions are standard for visualization and data normalization tasks related to simplexes. Given the absence of external interactions or malicious code, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard mathematical utilities for coordinate transformations and plotting support related to the 2-simplex. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
