  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard mathematical utilities for coordinate transformations and plotting support related to the 2-simplex. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature."
