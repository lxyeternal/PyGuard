{
  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for projecting data points onto a 2-simplex, useful for tasks involving ternary plots and data normalization in a visualization context.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments, such as lists, tuples, sequences, and limits/dictionaries for coordinate conversions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data transmissions observed; no network or file I/O functions present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through projection, normalization, permutation, and coordinate transformation functions without external influence or untrusted data handling that leads to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code performs mathematical computations and coordinate transformations without any obfuscated or misleading constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions for mathematical and geometric operations related to ternary plots and coordinate transformations. It reads data primarily from function parameters. It performs standard operations like normalization, permutation, projection, and coordinate conversion. There are no network operations, file I/O, or code that could be exploited for malicious purposes. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The functions are well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code intent. Overall, the code appears to be purely mathematical and visualization utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of mathematical utilities for projecting and converting points on a 2-simplex. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no data exfiltration, and no external communication. It is safe for use and does not pose security threats.",
