{
  "purpose": "The code provides a wrapper class for creating and manipulating ternary plots using matplotlib and a third-party ternary plotting library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through method parameters such as points, data, and event objects. It also reads configuration options like colors, labels, and scale settings.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include plotting functions (scatter, plot, heatmap) that render data on the plot, and callbacks that handle resize and draw events. No direct untrusted data output or network transmission is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters (e.g., points, data) into plotting functions, and from user-configured labels and styles into rendering. Callbacks ensure labels are redrawn on events. There are no suspicious data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward and well-structured, with no obfuscated logic, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs. The usage of third-party libraries is standard for plotting tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a class to manage ternary plots, including setting labels, background, gridlines, and plotting data. Callback functions handle plot redraws on resize events. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors are observed. It relies on standard matplotlib and a third-party ternary library. No suspicious dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of plotting and visualization without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign wrapper for ternary plotting, with no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. It adheres to standard plotting practices and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
