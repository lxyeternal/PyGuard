{
  "purpose": "This code provides a wrapper for creating and managing a ternary plotting interface using matplotlib and python-ternary, including customization and visualization features.",
  "sources": "Code reads user input for labels, plot parameters, and event triggers; accesses matplotlib figure and axes objects; uses external modules heatmapping, lines, plotting.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include savefig and show methods which output visualizations; annotations and labels may display user-provided text. No evident data exfiltration or network communication.",
  "flows": "User input influences labels, plot parameters, and visual styling. Labels and background settings are dynamically updated on resize or draw events. Data points and heatmaps are plotted based on input data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external connections, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on standard libraries and clearly named functions. Background color settings and event handling appear standard. No malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured wrapper around plotting functionalities, managing labels, background, and interactions for ternary plots. It connects callbacks for resize and draw events, allowing dynamic updates. External modules are used for plotting elements; no data leaks or network activity is present. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious behaviors such as code injection, data theft, or hidden backdoors. It performs expected visualization tasks with standard programming practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign plotting utility for ternary diagrams, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It safely manages visual elements and interactions, with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
