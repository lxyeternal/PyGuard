{
  "purpose": "A wrapper class for managing and simplifying the use of ternary plotting functions with matplotlib, including background customization, labels, gridlines, and various plot types.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (collections, functools, numpy, matplotlib) and local modules (.heatmapping, .lines, .plotting, .helpers). No external data input sources are present within the code.",
  "sinks": "Methods such as savefig and show write to files or display plots; no untrusted data sinks directly process external input. No network, file, or system commands execute that could leak or exfiltrate data.",
  "flows": "User-provided plot parameters flow into matplotlib and local plotting functions; internal methods handle rendering and drawing, but no external or untrusted data sources are processed within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code uses standard plotting techniques. No obfuscation, malicious function calls, or covert data exfiltration is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard visualization wrapper for ternary plotting, with no evidence of malicious behavior. It manages plot components, labels, gridlines, and background colors via straightforward calls to matplotlib and local modules. The callback functions and event handling are typical for GUI updates. No suspicious data flows, external network activity, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, well-structured wrapper for plotting purposes. It does not contain malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage features. The code solely facilitates visualization with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
