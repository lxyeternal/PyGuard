  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the logical consistency, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign wrapper for creating and manipulating ternary plots. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data leaks are observed.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no external threats identified.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence in benign nature.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code's functionality. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard plotting functions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or malicious features.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — very high confidence.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard visualization utility with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no external threats or vulnerabilities.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — complete confidence.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign plotting utility, with no malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no external threats or data leaks.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — very high.\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard plotting wrapper; no malicious activity, but notes a small security risk score of 0.1.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with benign analysis.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — this is slightly elevated, possibly due to the `plt.close()` and event handling, but these are standard features.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n- **Assessment:** The minor security risk score is reasonable, given that the code interacts with matplotlib's event system, which could, in theory, be exploited if combined with malicious inputs. However, the code itself does not process untrusted data in a way that would cause harm.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Justification:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a benign visualization wrapper.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or malicious data handling is present.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- The only slight concern is the security risk score of 0.1 in Report 5, which is justified given the event handling, but does not indicate actual malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — the code is clear, well-structured, and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.1** — very low; mainly due to standard event handling which could, in theory, be exploited if combined with malicious inputs, but not in this context.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign plotting utility with no security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The minor security risk score in Report 5 is justified but does not indicate actual malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain risk appears negligible.",
