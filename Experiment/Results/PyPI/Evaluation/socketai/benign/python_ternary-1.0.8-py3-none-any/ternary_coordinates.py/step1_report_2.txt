{
  "purpose": "The code appears to handle permutations related to coordinate systems and transformations, likely for geometric or graphical operations.",
  "sources": "Input data includes permutation strings ('brl', '012') and coordinate specifications via the 'coordinates' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write or output data to external systems or network interfaces. It performs internal transformations and raises exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input permutations are mapped via 'represent_permutation' and combined through 'compose_permutations'. Coordinate system functions convert coordinate representations based on the input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code; the code structure is standard. The 'represent_permutation' function references undefined variables 'translation_dict' and 'reverse_translation_dict', which could lead to runtime errors but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mappings between different coordinate representations and includes functions to represent permutations, compose them, and determine coordinate systems. The functions use standard permutation operations and string manipulations. Critical variables like 'translation_dict' and 'reverse_translation_dict' are referenced but not defined within the provided snippet, suggesting incomplete code or external dependencies. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, network activity, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The overall design appears consistent with a utility for geometric permutation handling, with no suspicious or malicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility module for coordinate permutation transformations. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The undefined variables may cause runtime errors but are unrelated to security threats.",
