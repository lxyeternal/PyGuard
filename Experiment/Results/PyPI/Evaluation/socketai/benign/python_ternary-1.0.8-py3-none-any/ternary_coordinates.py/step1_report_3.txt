{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define functions for handling permutations and coordinate systems related to 3D or geometric transformations, likely for a puzzle or graphical application.",
  "sources": "The code reads input through function parameters such as 'permutation', 'coordinates', 'inner', and 'outer'. It also accesses predefined dictionaries like 'axes_dict', 'reverse_translation_dict', and 'translation_dict'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any evident sinks that send data to untrusted sources or external systems. There are no network calls, file writes, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into permutation representations and transformations. For example, 'permutation' is mapped via 'represent_permutation', and 'coordinates' are processed and converted into permutation representations. No external data or untrusted inputs are manipulated into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The functions perform straightforward permutation operations and input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mappings for permutations ('brl' <-> '012') and provides functions to represent, compose, and interpret coordinate systems as permutations. The functions validate inputs against predefined sets and perform permutation composition using standard dictionary lookups. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The only potential concern is the exception raise if invalid coordinates are provided, which is standard input validation. Overall, the code is clean, well-structured, and free from suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for permutation and coordinate system management. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this fragment.",
