  "purpose": "Permutation and coordinate system transformations, likely for geometric or puzzle applications such as Rubik's Cube.",
  "sources": "Internal dictionaries (axes_dict, corners_dict), input permutations, coordinate strings.",
  "sinks": "None; internal computations only.",
  "flows": "Input permutations and coordinate strings flow into representation and composition functions, producing transformed permutations.",
  "anomalies": "References to undefined variables (`reverse_translation_dict`, `translation_dict`, `PERMUTATIONS`) suggest incomplete dependencies but no malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate permutation mappings and compositions without any signs of malicious activity. The undefined variables are likely external dependencies or parts of a larger codebase, not malicious. No obfuscation or malicious control flow is present. The functions are straightforward and serve geometric transformation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for permutation handling, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main issue is missing variable definitions, which could cause runtime errors but do not indicate security threats.",
