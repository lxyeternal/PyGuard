{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a plotting or visualization library, importing various plotting functions and modules for graphical data representation.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules such as .plotting, .lines, .helpers, .colormapping, .heatmapping, and .ternary_axes_subplot.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or sensitive operations; no network, file, or environment variable interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The code mainly consists of imports and an assignment of version string; there are no data flows involving external inputs or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution; the code is straightforward module import statements and a version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules and functions related to plotting and visualization, indicating it is part of a larger visualization package. It does not contain input handling, data processing, or external communication. The only notable variable is __version__, which is a static string. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. All code appears standard and benign, designed to organize and load plotting utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module initialization file for a visualization library, with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. It is safe to use.",
