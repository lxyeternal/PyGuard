{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a plotting or visualization library, providing functions for plotting, line drawing, helpers, colormapping, heatmaps, and ternary axes subplots.",
  "sources": "Imports from other modules within the package (e.g., .plotting, .lines, .helpers, etc.) and the __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code mainly defines imports and a version string.",
  "flows": "Data flow likely occurs within the imported functions when used elsewhere, but there are no direct data flows in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors, such as hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code, are present. The code is straightforward module import and version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple functions and classes from local modules related to plotting, lines, helpers, colormapping, heatmapping, and axes. It defines a version string. There are no functions, data processing, or external data reads present in this snippet. No signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. The code appears to be a standard setup module for a visualization library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module that organizes imports for a plotting library and sets a version number. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code fragment.",
