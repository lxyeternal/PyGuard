{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various plotting and visualization functions from a package related to data visualization, likely built on top of matplotlib.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the current module directory (relative imports) for plotting, lines, helpers, colormapping, heatmapping, and ternary axes subplots.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet; it only performs import operations without executing untrusted data or commands.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as this code solely performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs, are present in this code.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of import statements and a version assignment. It imports functions and classes related to plotting, lines, helpers, colormaps, heatmaps, and ternary axes from local modules, and sets a version string. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code's purpose appears to be establishing a library or module for data visualization, with no dynamic or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import section for a data visualization library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply loads dependencies necessary for visualization functionalities.",
