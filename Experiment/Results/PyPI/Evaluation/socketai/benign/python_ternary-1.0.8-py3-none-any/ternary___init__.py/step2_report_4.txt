  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a straightforward module import setup for a visualization library.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected.\n- The code contains only import statements and a version string.\n- No data flows, network operations, or external data handling are present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, with high confidence.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code only imports functions/classes from local modules and sets a version string.\n   - No evidence of code execution, data handling, or external interactions.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - Malware: 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated: 0, correct given the code's clarity.\n   - Security risk: 0, justified since there's no suspicious activity.\n   - Confidence: 1, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   \n   No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Not applicable; all scores are zero, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - Import statements are standard and do not pose security risks.\n   - No hidden or malicious code is present.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - Scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Estimated scores based on the analysis:**\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature, I agree with the current scores. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard module import setup for a visualization library. It poses no security risks, contains no malicious behavior, and is entirely benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe and unremarkable from a security perspective.\n- The current scores are accurate and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are:\n- malware: 0\n- obfuscated: 0\n- securityRisk: 0",
