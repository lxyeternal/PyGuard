  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details of the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of import statements from local modules and a version string assignment.\n- It imports functions related to plotting, lines, helpers, colormapping, heatmapping, and ternary axes.\n- There are no data processing, network operations, or system modifications.\n- The code appears to be a module setup for a visualization library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** The code matches the description: only import statements and a version string, with no suspicious or malicious activity.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:\n- **Logical flaws or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and benign.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes. The code shows no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Since all reports agree on 0 for malware and security risk, no justification is needed for higher scores.\n\n### Consistency with the reports:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and match the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The code is purely import statements and a version string, with no dynamic or external data handling.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The reports' conclusions are aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nBased on the analysis, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is a benign module setup for a visualization library.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is safe, with no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
