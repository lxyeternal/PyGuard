{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module for plotting and visualization, importing various functions related to plotting, lines, helpers, colormapping, heatmapping, and ternary axes.",
  "sources": "Imports from matplotlib, relative imports from other modules within the package (plotting, lines, helpers, colormapping, heatmapping, ternary_axes_subplot). No direct data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that handle untrusted data are present. No network operations, file writing, or system calls.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit source-to-sink data flows in this code; it mainly imports functions for plotting and visualization.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, importing various visualization functions and defining a version string. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules necessary for visualization, such as matplotlib and several internal modules. It defines a version string. There are no input data handling, network operations, or suspicious code constructs. The structure suggests a standard visualization library setup without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import module for visualization purposes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely aggregates and exposes visualization functions. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
