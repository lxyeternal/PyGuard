  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code consists solely of import statements from local modules and a version string assignment.\n   - There are no data processing, network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The imported modules relate to plotting, lines, helpers, colormapping, heatmapping, and axes, indicating a visualization library.\n   - The `__version__` string is a standard practice for version control.\n\n2. **Security and Malware Assessment:**\n   - No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present.\n   - No external data sources, network operations, or data sinks are evident.\n   - The code does not handle untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to security vulnerabilities.\n   - The import statements are static and straightforward, with no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely for importing visualization functions and setting a version string.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1), and the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero.\n\n4. **Score Justification:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The security risk score is 0, given the lack of any operations that could compromise security.\n\n5. **Critical Evaluation:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - There are no assumptions about vulnerabilities that are not supported by the code.\n   - The code is a standard module setup for a visualization library.\n\n6. **Final Recommendations:**\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n   - The overall risk assessment should remain at zero for malware and security risk, with a low obfuscation concern.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is benign, with no security issues or malicious intent.",
