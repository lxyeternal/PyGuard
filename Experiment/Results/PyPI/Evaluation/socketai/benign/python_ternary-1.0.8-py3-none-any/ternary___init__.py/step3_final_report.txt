  "purpose": "Import visualization functions and set version for a plotting library module.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules, version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static imports and variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and contains only import statements and a version string.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules and a version string, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No suspicious or malicious activity is present, and the code does not handle untrusted data or perform any actions that could compromise security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup for a visualization library, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and should be maintained.",
