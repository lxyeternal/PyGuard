  "flows": "Input snippets -> draw_func() -> PDFSurface -> file output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Directory creation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes PDF surfaces, processes snippets, and saves PDFs without external network calls or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are present. External functions are assumed safe. No obfuscation or credential handling is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign PDF generator with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores should reflect no malware or obfuscation, with minimal security risk due to file operations.",
