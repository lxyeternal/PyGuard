  "purpose": "Generate PDF files for each code snippet using the Cairo graphics library.",
  "sources": "Input: sys.argv for command-line arguments; snippets.get_snippets() for snippet data; snippet.draw_func for drawing operations.",
  "sinks": "File system write: creating PDF files in '_build/pdf/' directory.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> selection of snippets -> do_snippet() -> Cairo PDFSurface creation and drawing -> output files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns identified. Usage of standard libraries and drawing functions appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The script creates PDF files from snippets using Cairo. It reads command-line arguments to determine which snippets to process, then writes output PDFs to a directory. The code uses standard imports and functions. No network activity, no suspicious data handling, no obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present. The directory creation and file writing are straightforward. The only potential concern is the use of sys.argv for user input, but it is handled securely and locally. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign PDF generation utility. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior is evident. It safely processes snippets and outputs PDF files without security risks.",
