  "purpose": "Generate PDF files from code snippets using Cairo graphics library.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments, reading snippet data via get_snippets()",
  "sinks": "Writing PDF files to the _build/pdf directory, calling snippet.draw_func() which performs drawing operations",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> determine snippets to process -> do_snippet() -> creates PDF and calls snippet.draw_func()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code, no unusual code constructs. Usage of get_snippets() depends on external implementation but is not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a PDF generation pipeline based on snippets retrieved from get_snippets(). It processes command-line arguments to select specific snippets or all. The PDF files are stored in a dedicated directory. The drawing is handled by snippet.draw_func(). No network, file manipulation beyond PDF output, or hidden behaviors are evident. The script relies on external 'snippets' module, but no malicious activity is indicated in this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign PDF generator for code snippets with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It performs expected operations with safe libraries and practices.",
