  "purpose": "Generate PDF files from code snippets, rendering each snippet onto a PDF using cairo.",
  "sources": "get_snippets() function for retrieving snippets; command line arguments for snippet selection",
  "sinks": "cairo.PDFSurface for PDF output; file system for writing PDF files",
  "flows": "Command line input -> snippet selection -> snippet.draw_func(cr, width, height) -> writing PDF files to disk",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a PDF surface for each snippet, saves drawing operations via snippet.draw_func, and writes the output to disk. It uses standard library functions and the cairo library. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are detected. Snippet retrieval and drawing functions are external, but their usage here appears straightforward. No security risks or malware indications are evident in the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard script for rendering snippets into PDFs with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It operates as intended without harmful side effects.",
