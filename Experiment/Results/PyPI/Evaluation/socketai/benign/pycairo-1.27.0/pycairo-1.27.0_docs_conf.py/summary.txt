  "conclusion": "The code is primarily configuration with a controlled but potentially risky dynamic module load. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The main concern is the dynamic import from a relative path, which could be exploited if the file is compromised. Scores are consistent with this assessment, indicating low malware and obfuscation risk but moderate security risk due to the import pattern."
