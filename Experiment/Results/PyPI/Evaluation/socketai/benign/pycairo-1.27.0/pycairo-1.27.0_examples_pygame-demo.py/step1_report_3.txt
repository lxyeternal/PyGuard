{
  "purpose": "Demonstrate the use of pycairo for drawing and pygame for display in a Python graphical application.",
  "sources": "pygame.event.get() for input events, cairo.Surface.get_data() for image data",
  "sinks": "pygame.image.frombuffer() for rendering image data onto the screen",
  "flows": "Data read from cairo surface buffer flows into pygame image buffer, then displayed on screen; event handling reads input events",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external network calls, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, no backdoors or data leaks observed",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Cairo surface, draws a circle, converts the Cairo surface buffer into a pygame image, and displays it. Event handling only processes window close events and prints other events. There are no external network connections, no data exfiltration, and no code that manipulates or leaks sensitive data. The code functions solely as a graphical demonstration without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign graphical demo utilizing Cairo and Pygame with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
