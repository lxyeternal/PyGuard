{
  "purpose": "Demonstrate usage of pycairo for drawing and pygame for display.",
  "sources": "Reads user events from pygame.event.get() and system exit signals via sys.exit(0).",
  "sinks": "Calls sys.exit(0) upon quit event, potentially terminating the program. No other sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input events from pygame -> sys.exit or print; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The drawing code is straightforward and does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a Cairo surface and draws a circle, then displays it using pygame. It processes user events, exiting gracefully on quit signals. No external data is fetched or sent, no credentials are stored or transmitted, and no code indicates malicious intent. The only significant external interactions are with system exit and printing event details, which are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple graphical demonstration with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs expected functions without suspicious activity.",
