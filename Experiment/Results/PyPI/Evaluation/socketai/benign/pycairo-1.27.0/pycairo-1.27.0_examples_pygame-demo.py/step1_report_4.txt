  "purpose": "Demonstrate usage of pycairo and pygame libraries for drawing and display.",
  "sources": "pygame.event.get() for input events; cairo.Surface.get_data() for image buffer",
  "sinks": "pygame.image.frombuffer() for rendering to screen; sys.exit() for terminating the program",
  "flows": "Event handling flows from pygame.event.get() to sys.exit(); Cairo buffer data flows into pygame for display",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No data exfiltration, network connections, or malicious system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a cairo surface and uses pygame for display. It draws a circle using cairo, converts the cairo surface buffer into a pygame image, and displays it. Event handling is standard for pygame, allowing window close events to terminate cleanly. No suspicious data handling, network activity, or code injection is present. The code appears to be purely for graphical demonstration with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of graphics rendering using cairo and pygame. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified.",
