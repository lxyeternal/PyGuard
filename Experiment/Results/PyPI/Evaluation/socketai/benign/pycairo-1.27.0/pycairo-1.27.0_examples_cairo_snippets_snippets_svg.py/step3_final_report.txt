  "purpose": "Generate SVG files from code snippets using cairo graphics library.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, get_snippets() external function, snippet.draw_func()",
  "sinks": "File system for SVG output, command-line argument processing",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> get_snippets() -> do_snippet() -> snippet.draw_func() -> cairo drawing -> file output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SVG generator that processes snippets and outputs SVG files. It performs standard directory handling, checks for cairo's SVG support, and invokes external snippet drawing functions. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The external get_snippets() function is assumed safe, and the code does not contain any network activity or data exfiltration. The command-line argument handling is simple and secure. Overall, the code is benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SVG creation utility with no malicious or security concerns. The analysis and reports correctly identify the absence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
