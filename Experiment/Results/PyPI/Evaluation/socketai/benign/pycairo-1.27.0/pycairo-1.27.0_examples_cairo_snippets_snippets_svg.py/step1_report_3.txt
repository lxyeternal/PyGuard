{
  "purpose": "Create SVG files for visual snippets using cairo graphics library.",
  "sources": "Input is from command-line arguments and get_snippets() function; environment variables are not used.",
  "targets": "Filesystem where SVG files are saved in the '_build/svg/' directory.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments select specific snippets; get_snippets() provides snippets; snippets.draw_func() renders graphics to cairo surface.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code or misleading variable names. Use of 'cairo' is standard for graphics. No external data exfiltration or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a graphics surface, retrieves snippets, and generates SVG files. It uses standard libraries and functions without any suspicious patterns. The only notable point is handling command-line arguments to select snippets. No malicious behavior or backdoors are detected. The code does not perform network operations, data leaks, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a legitimate SVG generation utility that securely creates graphic files based on snippets. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
