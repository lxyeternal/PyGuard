  "purpose": "Generate SVG files for each code snippet using the cairo graphics library.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments (sys.argv), get_snippets() function, file system operations (os.makedirs), and snippet.draw_func execution.",
  "sinks": "Writing SVG files to '_build/svg/', invoking cairo.SVGSurface, and potentially using snippet.draw_func which could execute arbitrary drawing code.",
  "flows": "Command-line args → get_snippets() → loop over snippets → do_snippet() → cairo drawing functions → file output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard libraries and cairo graphics API. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms observed.",
  "analysis": "The script creates SVG files for graphical snippets, using the cairo library with proper output handling. It includes standard error handling for directory creation and checks for cairo's SVG support. The get_snippets() function is assumed to return safe snippet objects with a draw_func method. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data theft, or backdoors. The command-line argument handling is straightforward, controlling verbosity and snippet selection. Overall, the code performs file generation tasks without suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SVG file generator that utilizes the cairo library for rendering. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The implementation appears safe and benign.",
