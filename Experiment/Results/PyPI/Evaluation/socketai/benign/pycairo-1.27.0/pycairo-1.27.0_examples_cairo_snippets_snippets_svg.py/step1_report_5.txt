  "purpose": "Generate SVG files from code snippets using the cairo library.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, get_snippets() function for retrieving snippets, file system for creating directories and saving files.",
  "targets": "File system for saving SVG files, potentially the command line arguments if used maliciously.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> filtering snippets -> do_snippet() -> cairo.Surface writing SVG files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code straightforwardly generates SVG files based on provided snippets.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes by importing necessary modules and defines a function to generate SVG files for each snippet. It handles command-line arguments to select specific snippets or process all. The code uses cairo to generate SVG images and saves them into a designated directory. No external network calls, no data leakage, no code injection points, and no suspicious behavior are evident. The get_snippets() function is imported and not detailed here; assuming it is a normal data provider. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign task of generating SVG images from snippets. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
