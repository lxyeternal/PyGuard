  "purpose": "Generate SVG files for graphical snippets using cairo graphics library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters via sys.argv for snippet selection, and get_snippets() function providing snippet data.",
  "targets": "File output for SVG images in the '_build/svg' directory.",
  "flows": "User input (command-line args) determines selected snippets, which are then drawn to files via do_snippet() function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or obfuscated code. No unsafe input handling or code injection points identified.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes by importing required modules and defining a function to create SVG images with cairo. It checks for SVG support, sets verbose mode, and processes command-line arguments to select snippets. The snippets are retrieved from get_snippets() and drawn to files in a dedicated directory. The file output path and filename are constructed securely. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of get_snippets() depends on external implementation, but no malicious patterns are apparent in this code. Overall, this appears to be a standard graphics file generation script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script's purpose is to generate SVG images from snippets with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates locally, uses safe file handling, and does not process untrusted input beyond command-line arguments in a straightforward manner. No malware or security threats are detected.",
