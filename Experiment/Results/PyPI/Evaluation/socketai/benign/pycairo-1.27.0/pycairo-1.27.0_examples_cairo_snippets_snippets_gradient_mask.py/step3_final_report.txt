  "purpose": "Render a graphical pattern using cairo with gradients and masks.",
  "sources": "No external input, data, or untrusted sources; static code defining gradients and applying them.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code only performs graphics rendering with cairo API calls.",
  "flows": "Gradient creation and application flow within the graphics context; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports cairo, defines a draw function that scales the context, sets line width, creates a linear gradient pattern, creates a radial gradient mask, and applies the pattern and mask. It performs standard graphics operations without external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. All signals indicate benign, static rendering code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign graphics routine with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The provided reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
