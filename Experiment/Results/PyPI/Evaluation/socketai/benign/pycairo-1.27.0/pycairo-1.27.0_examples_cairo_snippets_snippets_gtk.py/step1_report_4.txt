{
  "purpose": "The code creates a GUI application using GTK to display and edit code snippets, allowing users to select and view snippets within the interface.",
  "sources": "Code reads snippets from get_snippets() function and user interactions such as selection changes in the GUI.",
  "sinks": "Text displayed in the GTK TextView buffer; user interactions trigger GUI updates but do not directly send data externally.",
  "flows": "Selection change in the snippet list updates the text buffer; drawing event uses current snippet's draw function to render content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward GTK application for snippet display. It imports and uses standard GTK and Pango libraries for GUI components. The get_snippets() function is external and its content isn't provided; assuming it's safe. The code handles user interaction through GTK signals, updating display content accordingly. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden backdoors. No unusual code patterns or obfuscation are present. Overall, the code appears benign and designed solely for UI purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard GTK GUI application for displaying code snippets, with no evidence of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
