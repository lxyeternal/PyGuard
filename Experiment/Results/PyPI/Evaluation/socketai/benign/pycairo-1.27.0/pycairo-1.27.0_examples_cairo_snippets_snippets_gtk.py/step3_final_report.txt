  "purpose": "A GTK GUI application for displaying code snippets with a list and visual rendering.",
  "sources": "External get_snippets() function providing snippet data.",
  "sinks": "Text buffer updates, drawing functions, user interface interactions.",
  "flows": "Selection from snippet list updates current_snippet and triggers redraw; draw_func of snippet called during rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; external dependency is unverified but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a standard GTK application with a snippet list, text view, and drawing area. It relies on an external get_snippets() function for data, which is not shown. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present. The drawing function is invoked during rendering, but without malicious code. All suspicious signals are absent; the code appears benign. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with a safe, straightforward application. The main external concern is the source of snippets, but within the code, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign GTK snippet viewer with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or high security risk. The external get_snippets() dependency could be a vector if malicious, but the code itself is safe. The assigned scores are justified and appropriate.",
