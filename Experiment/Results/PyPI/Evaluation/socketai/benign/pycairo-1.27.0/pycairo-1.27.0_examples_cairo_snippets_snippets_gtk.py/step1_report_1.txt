{
  "purpose": "This code creates a GTK-based GUI application that displays code snippets and their rendered drawings.",
  "sources": "The code reads snippet data from the get_snippets() function imported from snippets, and user interactions with the GUI components such as selection changes and drawing events.",
  "sinks": "The code sets text content in the TextView buffer and calls drawing functions; it also interacts with GUI components based on user input.",
  "flows": "User selects a snippet -> cb_selection_changed updates current_snippet and sets text -> da_draw_event calls current_snippet.draw_func(cr, width, height) to render the snippet",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no suspicious imports or hidden behaviors. The code appears to be a standard GTK application with expected behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs a GUI application that displays code snippets retrieved from get_snippets(). It uses standard GTK and Pango libraries without obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The draw function of snippets is invoked during drawing events, which appears to be a normal callback mechanism. No data leakage, network calls, or malicious code logic is present. The code interacts solely with GUI elements and data structures for display purposes. There are no indications of backdoors, malicious data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The imported functions and modules are typical for GUI apps; get_snippets() is external but not shown, so cannot be evaluated, though its usage seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign GUI application for displaying code snippets. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malware. The overall security risk is very low.",
