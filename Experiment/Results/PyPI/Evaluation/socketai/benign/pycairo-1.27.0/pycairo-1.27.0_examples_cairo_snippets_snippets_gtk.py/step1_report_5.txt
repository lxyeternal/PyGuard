{
  "purpose": "The code creates a GTK-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that displays code snippets and their content.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user interactions with the GUI components such as snippet selection, which triggers 'cb_selection_changed' to update the displayed code.",
  "sinks": "The code updates the GTK TextView widget with snippet code; no external sinks such as network or file system writes are present.",
  "flows": "User selects a snippet in the list -> 'cb_selection_changed' updates 'self.current_snippet' -> 'self.text_buffer.set_text' updates display -> 'self.da.queue_draw' triggers drawing of snippet content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. Usage of standard GTK library functions and no obfuscated or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a GTK window with text view and snippet list components, uses a function 'get_snippets' to populate snippets, and updates the display based on user selection. There are no indications of data leakage, malicious network activity, or malicious code execution. No external data sources or sinks suggest malicious intent. The code appears to be a straightforward GUI application for displaying predefined snippets.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign GUI application designed to display code snippets. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It uses standard GTK functions and well-structured code without any suspicious patterns.",
