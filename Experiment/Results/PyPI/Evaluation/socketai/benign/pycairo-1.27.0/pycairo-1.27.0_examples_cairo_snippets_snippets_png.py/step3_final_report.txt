  "purpose": "Generate PNG images from code snippets using Cairo graphics library.",
  "sources": "get_snippets() function providing snippet objects with 'name' and 'draw_func' attributes; command-line arguments for snippet selection.",
  "sinks": "Writing PNG files to disk in '_build/png/' directory.",
  "flows": "Source: snippets obtained from get_snippets(); flow: snippets' draw_func executed; sink: surface.write_to_png() saving image files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward script that renders snippets into PNG images, with proper directory handling and environment checks. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation present. External get_snippets() could introduce risk if malicious, but the code itself is benign. Multiple reports correctly assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk scores. Slightly higher risk scores (0.1-0.2) in some reports are conservative and acceptable given external dependencies. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor security risk scores are justified by external dependencies but do not indicate actual vulnerabilities. The reports are consistent and accurate; no modifications are necessary.",
