  "purpose": "Generate PNG images for each code snippet using cairo graphics library.",
  "sources": "sys.argv input for command-line arguments, get_snippets() for retrieving snippets data",
  "sinks": "surface.write_to_png(filename) writes image files to disk",
  "flows": "Command-line args influence which snippets are processed; snippets' draw_func methods generate graphics that are saved as PNG files",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Usage of standard libraries only. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes image surfaces, processes snippets with their draw functions, and saves PNG files. It reads command-line arguments to determine which snippets to process. No external data inputs or network interactions are present. The get_snippets() function's implementation is not shown, but it likely returns a collection of snippet objects with name and draw_func attributes. No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected, nor any hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate utility for generating images from snippet functions. No signs of malicious activity or security risks are evident in this code fragment.",
