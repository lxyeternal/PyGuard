  "purpose": "Generate PNG images from code snippets using the cairo graphics library.",
  "sources": "get_snippets() function call, sys.argv input, environment variables for cairo features, file system operations for saving PNGs.",
  "sinks": "surface.write_to_png(filename) saves images to disk.",
  "flows": "get_snippets() -> for each snippet: draw_func -> surface.write_to_png(filename). User input (sys.argv) influences which snippets are processed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No external network activity, no data leaks, and no system modifications beyond file creation.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily generates PNG images from snippets provided by get_snippets(). It performs environment checks for cairo support, processes command-line arguments to select snippets, and writes image files to disk. No untrusted data is processed beyond basic user input for selecting snippets. The environment variables and file operations are standard. The code does not include any obfuscated or malicious behavior. No network activity, data theft, or system disruption observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for creating PNG images from code snippets. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this code. It performs standard graphics rendering and file I/O operations with proper checks.",
