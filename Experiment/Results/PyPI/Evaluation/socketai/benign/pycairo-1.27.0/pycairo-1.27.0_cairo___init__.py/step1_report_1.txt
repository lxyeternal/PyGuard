  "purpose": "Provides a function to retrieve the directory path containing C header files for the package, supporting different installation contexts.",
  "sources": "os.path.realpath(__file__), os.path.dirname(__file__), pkg_resources.resource_filename()",
  "sinks": "None directly related to untrusted data, mainly filesystem path retrieval and package resource access",
  "flows": "File path determination from __file__ to include directory, with fallback to package resources",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns; straightforward filesystem and package resource access",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper function to locate include files for the package, considering installed, source, or egg environments. It uses standard Python os and pkg_resources modules. No user input handling, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. The code is simple and aligns with common package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility function for locating include files, with no malicious intent or security issues identified.",
