{
  "purpose": "Provide a utility function to locate include directories for C header files within the package or environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file path (__file__), environment directories, and package resource files.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or execution flows affecting system security.",
  "flows": "The function determines paths based on file existence checks and package resource lookups; no untrusted data flows into critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to locate include directories by checking multiple locations: the package directory, the source directory, and package resources for egg installs. It uses standard Python modules os and pkg_resources. The logic is straightforward and typical for package setup scripts. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident; the code performs safe filesystem checks and resource lookups without executing external commands or handling untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for locating include directories, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply performs filesystem existence checks and resource lookups, which are common and safe in this context.",
