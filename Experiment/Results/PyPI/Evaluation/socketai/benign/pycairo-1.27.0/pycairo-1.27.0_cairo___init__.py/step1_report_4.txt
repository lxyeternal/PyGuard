{
  "purpose": "Provides a function to retrieve the include directory path for C header files associated with the package.",
  "sources": "Reads the file system to determine the existence of specific directories and uses 'pkg_resources' to locate resources within the package.",
  "sinks": "None present; code does not process untrusted data or user input that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Path determined based on directory existence checks, no external data flow or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard directory checks and resource locating mechanisms are used.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module, defines a function to find header file directories, checks for the presence of directories in various installation contexts, and falls back to 'pkg_resources' to locate package data. All operations involve filesystem access and resource management typical for package setup or build scripts. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for locating include directories, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It performs typical environment checks and resource lookups without any suspicious activities.",
