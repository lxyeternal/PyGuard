  "purpose": "Provides a function to retrieve the path to include directory containing C header files for the package.",
  "sources": "Reads the __file__ attribute to determine the package path, checks for existence of specific directories, and uses pkg_resources to locate resources.",
  "sinks": "No data is passed to or from untrusted sources, no external data is used without validation, and no data is transmitted or leaked.",
  "flows": "Gets current file path -> checks directory existence -> potentially retrieves resource filename via pkg_resources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; standard directory existence checks; no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function for locating include directories, considering installed, source, and egg scenarios. Uses standard os.path methods and pkg_resources for resource location. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior observed. The code appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for locating include files and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It operates as intended with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
