  "purpose": "Utility function to locate the include directory for package headers, considering installation context (installed package, source directory, or egg).",
  "sources": "Filesystem checks for 'include' directory in package path, source path, or egg resource lookup via pkg_resources.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem existence checks and resource filename retrieval; no untrusted data handling or external effects.",
  "flows": "Checks if 'include' exists in package or source directory, or retrieves resource filename if not found in filesystem.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; standard filesystem and resource lookup functions; import of compiled extension is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward directory existence checks and resource lookup without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The import of a compiled extension module '_cairo' is common in extension packages and not suspicious. The logic is clear, standard, and safe. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. All signals indicate benign behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility function for locating include directories, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior detected. The reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
