  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward utility function for locating include directories.\n- The code relies solely on standard modules (`os`, `pkg_resources`) and filesystem checks.\n- No untrusted input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The only potentially notable point is the import of `from ._cairo import *`, which suggests a compiled extension module, but this is typical for C extension packages and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code logic matches the descriptions: it determines the path to include files based on installation context.\n- No issues are found with the code's correctness or security.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The use of `import *` from a local extension is standard in extension modules; no malicious intent is implied.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. All code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or higher? No, the code is benign, so a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- All reports assign a **securityRisk** of 0, which is correct.\n- The **confidence** scores are all 1, which is reasonable given the clear, standard code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard utility function for locating include directories, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on the review:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions.",
