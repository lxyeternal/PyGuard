  "purpose": "Provides a function to retrieve the include directory path for C header files associated with the package.",
  "sources": "os.path methods, pkg_resources.resource_filename(__name__, 'include')",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data used in a way that leads to security risks",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from ._cairo import *' which might import a compiled extension; no suspicious dynamic code or backdoors present. Function logic is straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function to determine the location of header files, checking several common installation contexts: installed package, source directory, or in an egg. It uses safe OS and pkg_resources APIs without processing untrusted data or executing external commands. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code paths, and no obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for locating include directories. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
