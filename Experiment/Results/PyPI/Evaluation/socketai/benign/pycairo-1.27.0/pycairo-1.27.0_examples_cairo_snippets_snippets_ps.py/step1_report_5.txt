  "purpose": "Generate PostScript (.ps) files for each code snippet using cairo graphics library.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (command line arguments), get_snippets() function, snippet.draw_func (callback for drawing).",
  "sinks": "cairo.PSSurface (file output), surface.finish() (finalize output), potentially user input via command-line args.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> selected snippets -> do_snippet() -> cairo surface and context -> snippet.draw_func -> surface.finish().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Use of standard cairo library is typical. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The code handles file output and command-line args securely.",
  "analysis": "The script creates PostScript files for visual snippets, utilizing the cairo library for rendering. It processes command-line arguments to select snippets, with options for verbose output control. No input from untrusted sources other than command-line args is processed; no network or data leakage code observed. The usage of os.makedirs is straightforward, with exception handling. The drawing function is invoked through a callback mechanism, which could be user-defined but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe operations are evident. The script's behavior aligns with typical graphics generation tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard graphics file creation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not include suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The overall security risk is very low.",
