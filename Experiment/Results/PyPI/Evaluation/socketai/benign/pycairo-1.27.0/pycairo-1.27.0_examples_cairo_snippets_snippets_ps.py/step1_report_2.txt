  "purpose": "Generate PostScript files for visual snippets using the cairo graphics library.",
  "sources": "User input via command line arguments (sys.argv), get_snippets() function (external), no other explicit data sources.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations to '_build/ps/{snippet.name}.ps', creation of cairo.PSSurface which writes to disk.",
  "flows": "Command line args → selection of snippets → do_snippet() → writing to files via cairo surface",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no suspicious external network activity, no obfuscated code, and no malicious code patterns detected. The use of get_snippets() is external and not shown; assumed safe. No user data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The script creates PostScript files for each snippet by invoking external get_snippets() and rendering via cairo. It handles command line arguments to select specific snippets or all, and generates output files in a designated directory. The code interacts only with local filesystem and cairo library, with no network activity or secret management. No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious code behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard file generation script for visual snippets, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided code. The only external dependency is get_snippets(), which appears safe given no evidence of malicious behavior.",
