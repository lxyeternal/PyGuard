{
  "purpose": "The script generates PostScript (.ps) files for graphical snippets using the cairo library.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'snippets' module via get_snippets(), command-line arguments, and environment variables.",
  "targets": "The code writes output files (.ps) in the '_build/ps' directory and interacts with the filesystem. No network or external system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input from get_snippets() and command-line args determines which snippets to process; these snippets are then rendered into .ps files, with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard library functions and cairo for graphics rendering. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies cairo PS support, processes command-line args to select snippets, and creates PostScript files for each snippet by invoking their draw functions. It handles directory creation and file writing securely. No external network, no credential handling, and no suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs legitimate file generation tasks for graphics snippets without any malicious intent. It appears to be a standard utility script with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
