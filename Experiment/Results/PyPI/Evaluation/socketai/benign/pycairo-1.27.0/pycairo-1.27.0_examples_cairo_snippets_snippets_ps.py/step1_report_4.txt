  "purpose": "Generate PostScript (.ps) files for graphical snippets using cairo library.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, get_snippets() for retrieving snippets, os.environ and os.makedirs for directory creation.",
  "sinks": "cairo.PSSurface for file output, print statements for verbose logs, os.makedirs for directory creation.",
  "flows": "sys.argv inputs influence which snippets are processed, get_snippets() supplies snippets, snippet.draw_func() renders graphics onto the cairo context, which is then saved to a file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. Usage of standard cairo library for rendering. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. The code does not perform network operations or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes graphical rendering using cairo, creates output directories, and generates PostScript files for each snippet. Command-line arguments are used to select specific snippets or all snippets. The code checks for cairo's PS support before proceeding. No external data is read from untrusted sources other than command-line args, which are used solely for selection purposes. There are no embedded malicious commands, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The functions and modules used are standard and appropriate for the task. No anomalies or indicators of malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard script for generating PostScript files from snippets, with no signs of malicious or maliciously sabotaged code. It performs expected operations securely and transparently.",
