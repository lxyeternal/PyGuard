  "purpose": "Generate PostScript files for each code snippet using cairo graphics library.",
  "sources": "get_snippets() external function providing snippet data; sys.argv for command-line arguments; os and sys modules for filesystem and environment handling.",
  "sinks": "File creation for .ps files; directory creation; potential input from sys.argv affecting snippet selection.",
  "flows": "sys.argv input influences selected snippets; snippets.draw_func() executes drawing commands; files are written to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. External get_snippets() is a potential external dependency but assumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard file and graphics operations without network activity or secret handling. It checks for cairo PS support, creates directories, and writes PS files based on snippets. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External dependencies are minimal and used safely. Command-line arguments influence snippet selection but do not introduce security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for rendering graphics into PostScript files. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1), justified by external dependencies and input handling.",
