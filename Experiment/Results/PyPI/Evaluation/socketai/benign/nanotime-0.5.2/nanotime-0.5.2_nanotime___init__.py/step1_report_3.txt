  "purpose": "Provides a high-precision timestamp class and conversion utilities for nanosecond resolution time handling.",
  "sources": "time.time() in the now() method, input parameters in class constructors and conversion methods.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output, network communication, or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "time.time() → nanotime.now() → returns nanotime object; external data (like datetime objects) → conversion functions → nanotime objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors detected. The code performs straightforward time conversions and representations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a nanotime class for nanosecond precision time representation, with methods to convert between units and from standard Python datetime objects. It uses time.time() to get current Unix timestamp, which is standard for time retrieval. Conversion functions are standard and do not perform any network operations, data leaks, or system modifications. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated segments, or suspicious external calls. The purpose appears solely to facilitate high-resolution time measurements and conversions.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign utility for high-precision timing, with no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It strictly handles time data and conversions without external communication or data exfiltration.",
