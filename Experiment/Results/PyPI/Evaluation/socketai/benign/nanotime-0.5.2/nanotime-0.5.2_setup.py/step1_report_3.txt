  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'nanotime' Python package, used to install the package and its metadata.",
  "sources": "Import of 'nanotime' module to retrieve its __version__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Import of 'nanotime' to access version info -> passing version to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code structure and imports are standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and a local module 'nanotime' to configure package installation. It retrieves the package version dynamically from the 'nanotime' module. There are no inputs from external sources during runtime, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and adheres to common setup conventions. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, and no data leaks or unsafe operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup script for packaging a module named 'nanotime.' It appears benign, with no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
