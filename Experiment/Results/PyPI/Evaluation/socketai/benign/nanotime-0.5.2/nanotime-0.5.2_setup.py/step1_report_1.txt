  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'nanotime' Python package, used to specify package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Import of 'nanotime' module to retrieve version information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data output points are present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'nanotime' -> retrieving '__version__' -> passing to setup()",
  "anomalies": "None observed; standard setup script structure. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for packaging and the 'nanotime' module to access its version number dynamically. The setup() function specifies package metadata, including name, version, description, author details, URL, keywords, packages, dependencies, and license. The code is straightforward and typical of Python package setup files. There are no signs of code injection, malicious behavior, or suspicious code execution. The import of 'nanotime' is only to get the version string, which is standard practice. The comments do not indicate malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs normal package configuration tasks without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
