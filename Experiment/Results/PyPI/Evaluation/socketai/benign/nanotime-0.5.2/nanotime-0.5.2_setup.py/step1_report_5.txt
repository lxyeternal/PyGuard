  "purpose": "Setup script for installing the nanotime Python package",
  "sources": "Reads nanotime.__version__, package metadata, and setup parameters",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; setup configuration is static",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements; the comment about 'not customary' is benign and does not impact security",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and a local dependency 'nanotime'. It dynamically uses nanotime.__version__ for versioning, which is a common pattern. The rest of the setup parameters are static strings and lists defining package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are involved. The comment about 'not customary' appears to be a benign note. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or code intended for exploitation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies.",
