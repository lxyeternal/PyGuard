  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports consistently identify this code as a standard, benign Python setup script.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code only imports 'setuptools' and the 'nanotime' module to retrieve its version, then passes metadata to 'setup()'.\n- No external data, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The comments are benign, with one noting \"not customary,\" which is not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This aligns with the analysis; there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 in all reports. Given the benign nature, this is appropriate.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n- The only minor point is the comment \"not customary,\" which might suggest some unusual practice, but it is benign and not indicative of any security concern.\n- The dynamic import of 'nanotime' solely to access '__version__' is standard and safe.\n\n**Any discrepancies or suggestions?**\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis setup script is a typical, safe package configuration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No further action required; the code is safe and standard.",
