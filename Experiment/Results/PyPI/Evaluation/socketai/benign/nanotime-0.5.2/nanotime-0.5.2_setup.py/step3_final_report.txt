{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python setup script for packaging the 'nanotime' module, importing 'setuptools' and the module itself to retrieve its version, then calling setup() with metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version from 'nanotime.__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "The version is retrieved from 'nanotime.__version__' and passed to setup().",
  "anomalies": "The comment about 'not customary' is benign; no obfuscation or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical, benign package setup file with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or hardcoded secrets. It imports only standard modules and a local module to get version info, then calls setup() with static metadata. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate.",
