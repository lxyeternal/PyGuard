  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Potential data flows from environment variables, user input, or external sources; code execution points; network or file output operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network sockets, file systems, or subprocesses.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code or suspicious patterns; no obfuscation or malicious code detected; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no code presence, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the descriptions. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited information. No anomalies or suspicious flows are identified. The assessments are conservative but justified, reflecting the lack of concrete evidence for malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are accurate and consistent with the available information. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The low security risk scores are appropriate, and all assessments are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
