  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task related to data processing or system interaction, but the exact intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user input, or data from network connections. Specific reading points are not explicitly visible in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands execution, network communication, file I/O, or data transmission. No explicit unsafe calls are identified without further details.",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources to sinks is not explicitly demonstrated in the provided snippet. Lack of concrete source or sink calls prevents precise flow mapping.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are detected in the visible code. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis indicates the code performs standard data handling and system interactions without suspicious logic or obfuscation. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current review, the code shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, with no suspicious behaviors identified.",
