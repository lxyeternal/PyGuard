{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform a basic utility function, but the actual purpose cannot be conclusively determined without further context.",
  "sources": "Input is read from environment variables and function parameters; no external data sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed and printed; no clear sinks involve sensitive data or system commands.",
  "flows": "Inputs from environment variables flow into functions and are printed or used in calculations; no data leaks or unsafe operations are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements are detected. The code structure is straightforward, with no unusual language features or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables and accepts function inputs; it performs simple operations and outputs results. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network activity are observed. Usage of standard library functions and lack of suspicious code constructs suggest a benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment. It appears to serve a normal utility purpose without any indications of malicious intent.",
