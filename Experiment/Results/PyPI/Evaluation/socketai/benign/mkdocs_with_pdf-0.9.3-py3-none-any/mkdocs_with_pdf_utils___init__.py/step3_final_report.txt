{
  "purpose": "The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. It reads environment variables and performs simple operations.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, function parameters",
  "sinks": "Output functions, environment variables (if modified), network calls (none detected)",
  "flows": "Environment variables → processing functions → output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables and function inputs, performs straightforward processing, and outputs results. No malicious patterns, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The code structure is simple, with no external network connections or data leaks. The low security risk score (0.2) and malware score (0) are justified by the benign nature. Confidence is high (0.9), given the lack of complexity or suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
