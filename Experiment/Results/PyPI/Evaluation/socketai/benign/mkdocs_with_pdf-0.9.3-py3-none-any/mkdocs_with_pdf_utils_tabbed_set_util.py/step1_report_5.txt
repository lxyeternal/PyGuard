{
  "purpose": "The function modifies an HTML/XML document to wrap tabbed set content and expand details elements.",
  "sources": "Reads from soup.select() to find 'div.tabbed-set' and 'details' elements; reads 'next_siblings' of radio inputs.",
  "sinks": "Modifies the DOM by wrapping elements and setting 'open' attribute on 'details' tags.",
  "flows": "Selects elements, processes siblings, and modifies the DOM structure without external data or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or hidden backdoors. Uses standard library functions and third-party library appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code manipulates the DOM structure of an HTML document. It wraps certain sibling elements within a new div, based on 'div.tabbed-set' and 'input' elements, and expands 'details' tags by setting the 'open' attribute. There are no external data inputs, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The operations performed are typical for HTML processing or templating tasks, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate DOM manipulation function for web content presentation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The functionality is straightforward and safe within the context of HTML content processing.",
