  "purpose": "The function modifies HTML content by wrapping specific elements within a 'div' and expanding 'details' tags.",
  "sources": "The code reads HTML content from the 'soup' parameter, which is a BeautifulSoup PageElement object.",
  "sinks": "The code manipulates the DOM by wrapping elements and setting attributes on 'details' tags, but does not write or transmit data outside the process.",
  "flows": "The code reads HTML structure ('soup'), searches for 'div.tabbed-set' and 'details', and modifies the DOM in place by wrapping elements and changing attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, and no unusual dynamic code execution are present. The code uses standard BeautifulSoup methods.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library and third-party BeautifulSoup methods to traverse and modify the DOM. It wraps sibling elements following 'input' tags inside 'div' elements and expands 'details' tags. No external network communication, credential handling, or malicious actions are evident. The purpose appears to be UI/UX enhancement or content reformatting. There are no anomalies or signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs DOM manipulation for HTML content formatting without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility function.",
