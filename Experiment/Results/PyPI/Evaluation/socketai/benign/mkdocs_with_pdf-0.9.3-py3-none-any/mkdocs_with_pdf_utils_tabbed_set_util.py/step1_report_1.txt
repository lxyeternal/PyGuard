{
  "purpose": "The code processes HTML content by wrapping sibling elements within specific divs and modifying 'details' tags to be open, likely for rendering or UI enhancement.",
  "sources": "Reads HTML elements from the 'soup' object, specifically 'div.tabbed-set', 'input' elements, and 'details' elements.",
  "sinks": "Modifies the HTML structure directly by wrapping elements and setting attributes on 'details' tags.",
  "flows": "Selects 'div.tabbed-set' -> iterates over 'input' elements -> gathers sibling elements until 'input' -> wraps 'input' with new div -> appends sibling elements -> modifies 'details' tags to be open.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic observed. Use of 'logger' parameter is present but not utilized, which is benign. No network operations, data leaks, or malicious backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The function primarily manipulates HTML content for presentation purposes. It uses standard BeautifulSoup operations to modify the DOM structure without executing code or performing external communications. The 'logger' parameter is present but unused. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, remote commands, or stealth behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign HTML manipulation routine intended for UI enhancement, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
