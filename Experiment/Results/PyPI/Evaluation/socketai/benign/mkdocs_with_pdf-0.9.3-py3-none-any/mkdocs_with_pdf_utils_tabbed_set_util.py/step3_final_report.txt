  "purpose": "The code manipulates HTML DOM elements to organize tabbed content and expand details sections for UI presentation.",
  "sources": "Selects 'div.tabbed-set' elements and their 'input' children; selects 'details' elements.",
  "sinks": "Appends sibling elements into newly created wrappers; sets 'open' attribute on 'details' elements.",
  "flows": "Inputs' sibling elements are collected and appended into wrappers; 'details' elements are expanded by setting 'open'.",
  "anomalies": "Unused 'logger' parameter; no malicious code, obfuscation, or external communication observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward DOM manipulation using BeautifulSoup, wrapping 'input' elements and expanding 'details' tags. No suspicious patterns, network activity, or credential handling are present. The 'logger' parameter is unused but benign. The code's operations are typical for UI content adjustments. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal risk. The high confidence score (near 1) is justified given the clarity and simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign HTML DOM manipulation utility with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No improvements or modifications are necessary.",
