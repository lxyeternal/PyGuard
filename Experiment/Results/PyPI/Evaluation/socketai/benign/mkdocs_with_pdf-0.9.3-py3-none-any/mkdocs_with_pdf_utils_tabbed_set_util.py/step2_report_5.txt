  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Selects 'div' elements with class 'tabbed-set'\n- For each 'input' inside, gathers sibling elements until encountering another 'input'\n- Wraps the 'input' with a new 'div' with class 'tabbed-content--wrap'\n- Appends the gathered sibling elements into this wrapper\n- Sets the 'open' attribute on all 'details' tags\n\n**Security implications:**\n- The code performs straightforward DOM manipulation.\n- No external network calls, credential handling, or data exfiltration.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code patterns.\n- The 'logger' parameter is unused, which is benign but could be improved for maintainability.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Are any issues present?**  \n  No. The code is benign, standard DOM manipulation.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The 'logger' parameter is unused, which is not a security flaw but could be considered a missed opportunity for logging or debugging.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malware or malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign very low (0.1 to 0.2). Given the benign nature, this seems reasonable. Slightly higher scores (e.g., 0.2) might be justified if considering the potential for misuse, but since the code is purely DOM manipulation, a score of 0.1-0.2 is acceptable.\n\n### Critical points:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is justified.\n- No suspicious patterns or assumptions are made in the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign, purely presentational nature, I would assign a **risk score of 0.1** — consistent with the reports, slightly above zero due to the possibility of misuse in a different context, but overall very low.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code does not execute any malicious behavior.\n- The use of 'logger' is unnecessary but not harmful.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0 — no malicious activity detected                                |\n| Obfuscated      | 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation evident             |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1 — minimal risk, primarily due to DOM manipulation, no external threats |\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's actual behavior.",
