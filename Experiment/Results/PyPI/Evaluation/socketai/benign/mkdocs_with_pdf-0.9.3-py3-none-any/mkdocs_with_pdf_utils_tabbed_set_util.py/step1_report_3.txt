{
  "purpose": "To manipulate HTML content by wrapping certain elements within a div and modifying 'details' tags to be open.",
  "sources": "The code reads HTML elements via soup.select and iterates over siblings and child elements within the HTML structure.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the DOM by wrapping elements and setting attributes; no untrusted data is directly written out or sent over network.",
  "flows": "HTML elements selected via CSS selectors are iterated; certain sibling elements are wrapped within new tags, and 'details' tags are altered.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns detected. Use of 'logger' parameter is optional and not utilized. No dynamic execution or obfuscation evident.",
  "analysis": "The code uses BeautifulSoup to select 'div' with class 'tabbed-set' and wraps certain sibling elements in a new 'div'. It also sets 'open' attribute on 'details' elements. The logic appears to be straightforward HTML content manipulation without external input or data leakage. The 'logger' parameter is present but not used, which could be a concern for maintainability but not security. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a DOM manipulation utility for enhancing HTML content presentation. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are detected. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or harmful operations.",
