  "purpose": "The function wraps tabbed set content within HTML structure and opens all <details> tags in the provided soup object.",
  "sources": "The code reads HTML elements via BeautifulSoup's select method and accesses siblings of radio input elements.",
  "sinks": "Modifies the DOM by inserting new tags, wrapping existing elements, and setting attributes on <details> tags.",
  "flows": "Reads HTML structure, wraps certain elements, and alters <details> tags by setting the 'open' attribute.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No external network calls or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code processes an HTML DOM, selecting specific elements to wrap content in a new div and to set the 'open' attribute on <details> tags. It uses itertools.takewhile to gather sibling elements until encountering an 'input' element, which is safe and standard for DOM manipulation. There is no indication of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or harmful operations. Usage of the logger parameter is optional and not utilized here. The overall logic is straightforward HTML processing without suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform benign DOM manipulation related to UI presentation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
