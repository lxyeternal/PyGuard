  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the actual code to verify accuracy, consistency, and potential security implications.\n\n**Code Summary Recap:**\n- Selects all `<div class=\"tabbed-set\">` elements, then for each `<input>` inside, it gathers sibling elements until another `<input>` is encountered, wraps the `<input>` in a new `<div class=\"tabbed-content--wrap\">`, and appends the gathered siblings into this wrapper.\n- Also, selects all `<details>` elements and sets their `'open'` attribute to expand them.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n\n**Confirmed:**  \n- The code performs straightforward DOM manipulations using BeautifulSoup.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues is present.\n- No network activity, credential handling, or data exfiltration.\n\n**Notes:**  \n- The `logger` parameter is unused, which is benign but could be flagged for code cleanliness or future use.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**\n\n**Observation:**  \n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security flaws.\n- They correctly identify the code as standard DOM manipulation for UI purposes.\n- The reports mention the unused `logger` parameter but do not interpret it as a security concern, which is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- No logical errors or misconceptions are evident in the reports.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n\n- All reports assign `malware` score = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` between 0.1 and 0.2.\n- These are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \n- The `securityRisk` scores could be slightly lower (e.g., 0.05) since the code is very safe, but 0.1 is acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**\n\n- **No component of the code is malicious or risky.**  \n- The code does not perform external communication, handle sensitive data, or execute obfuscated code.\n- The only minor concern is the unused `logger`, which does not impact security.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Risk scores above 0.5 are unjustified.**  \n- The current scores (around 0.1) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware Score Analysis**\n\n- All reports correctly assign `malware` = 0.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n\n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's operations.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Score Consistency**\n\n- The scores align well with the code's behavior.\n- The high confidence levels are justified given the straightforward DOM manipulations.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment & Final Estimation**\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Security Risk Score:** **0.05 to 0.1** (a very low risk, given the benign nature)\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code manipulates HTML DOM for UI purposes without any malicious intent.\n- No obfuscation, external network activity, or credential handling.\n- The only minor concern is the unused `logger`, which does not pose a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Aspect                | Final Estimate                                              |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score         | 0                                                            |\n| Obfuscated Score      | 0                                                            |\n| Security Risk Score   | 0.05 – 0.1 (very low, primarily for completeness)          |\n\n**The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.
