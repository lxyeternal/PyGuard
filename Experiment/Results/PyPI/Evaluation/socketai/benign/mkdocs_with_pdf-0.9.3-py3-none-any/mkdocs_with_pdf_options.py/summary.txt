  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe configuration class with no malicious intent. The primary security consideration is the external dependency on user-supplied paths, which could be exploited if malicious binaries are placed at those locations. The malware score is 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. The risk score can be slightly increased to 0.2 to reflect this potential external risk, but overall, the code is safe."
