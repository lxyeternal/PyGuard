  "purpose": "Defines configuration options and initialization for a document processing system with optional JavaScript rendering and theming.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration values from local_config and config dictionaries; imports from external modules.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; code primarily assigns configuration data to class attributes.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from input dictionaries into class attributes, no untrusted data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual code structures detected. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class for handling configuration options with proper defaulting and property methods. It imports modules that likely perform other functions but no suspicious or malicious code is present within this snippet. No external data sources or untrusted inputs appear to be processed directly in a harmful way. The setup of a headless Chrome driver could be potentially misused if the driver is maliciously replaced, but within this code, it simply calls a setup method. Overall, the code is standard configuration handling without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a configuration handler for a PDF/document generation system. It appears safe with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected.",
