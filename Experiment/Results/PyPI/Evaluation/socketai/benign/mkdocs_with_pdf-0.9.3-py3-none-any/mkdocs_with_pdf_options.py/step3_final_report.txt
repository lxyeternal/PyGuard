  "purpose": "Configuration class for a document generation tool, managing various settings such as paths, themes, and rendering options.",
  "sources": "Configuration inputs from 'local_config' and 'config' dictionaries, including paths like 'headless_chrome_path' and 'custom_template_path'.",
  "sinks": "Paths passed to external setup functions like HeadlessChromeDriver.setup; no direct execution or untrusted data handling within this code.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from input dictionaries to class attributes, then to external setup functions for dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected. External paths are user-controlled but not executed here.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration handler initializing parameters for a document processing system. It relies on external inputs for paths and options but does not perform any malicious operations or dynamic code execution. The main security concern is trusting user-supplied paths like 'headless_chrome_path' and 'custom_template_path', which could be exploited if malicious binaries are supplied. However, the code itself does not execute or validate these paths beyond passing them to setup functions. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe configuration class with no malicious intent. The primary security consideration is the external dependency on user-supplied paths, which could be exploited if malicious binaries are placed at those locations. The malware score is 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. The risk score can be slightly increased to 0.2 to reflect this potential external risk, but overall, the code is safe.",
