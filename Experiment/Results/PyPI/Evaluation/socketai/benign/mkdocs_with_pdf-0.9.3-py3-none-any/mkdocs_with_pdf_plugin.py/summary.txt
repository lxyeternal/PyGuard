  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured MkDocs plugin with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The environment variable controls are standard and do not introduce security concerns. The scoring of malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) is justified and consistent with the analysis."
