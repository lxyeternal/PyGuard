{
  "purpose": "Generate a table of contents and numbered headings within an HTML document by manipulating the DOM using BeautifulSoup, based on heading levels and options.",
  "sources": "HTML headings (h1, h2, h3) in the DOM, options object for configuration, and optional exclusion list.",
  "sinks": "DOM elements such as 'ul', 'li', 'a', and insertion points within the document body; logging functions for debug and info messages.",
  "flows": "Find headings -> determine numbering and exclusion -> create TOC structure -> insert TOC at start of body -> add numbering spans to headings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious external calls, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, straightforward DOM manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard DOM processing: it finds headings, generates a nested TOC with links, numbers headings up to a configurable level, and inserts the TOC at the start of the document. It uses safe BeautifulSoup methods, with no external network or code execution. The functions are well-structured, with clear logic for handling heading levels, exclusions, and numbering. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The logging is for debugging and informational purposes only. The code's behavior aligns with typical document processing utilities, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for generating a table of contents and numbered headings in an HTML document. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk (around 0.1) are justified and consistent with its behavior.",
