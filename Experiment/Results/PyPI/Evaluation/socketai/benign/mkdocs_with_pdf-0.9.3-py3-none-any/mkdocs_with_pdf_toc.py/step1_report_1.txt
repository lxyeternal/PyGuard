{
  "purpose": "The code generates a structured table of contents (TOC) and numbered headings for a document represented as a BeautifulSoup DOM object.",
  "sources": "Input DOM object 'soup' (HTML content), options object 'options' (configuration parameters), and potentially external logging configurations.",
  "sinks": "DOM modification methods such as 'insert', 'append', 'new_tag', and 'find_all' which manipulate or generate HTML elements based on document structure.",
  "flows": "DOM parsing and modification flow: input DOM -> find headings -> generate TOC and numbered headings -> insert into DOM.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious external calls detected. No obfuscated code, misleading variable names, or dynamic code execution observed. Use of internal functions and safe DOM methods.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manipulates HTML structure using BeautifulSoup: generating a table of contents, numbering headings, and adding links. It includes internal logic for excluding certain headings based on IDs, but no network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The code operates within safe bounds, using only DOM manipulation and logging. There is no evidence of malicious intent such as data theft, system damage, or covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate document processing utility for generating navigable and numbered documents. It uses safe DOM manipulation methods and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal.",
