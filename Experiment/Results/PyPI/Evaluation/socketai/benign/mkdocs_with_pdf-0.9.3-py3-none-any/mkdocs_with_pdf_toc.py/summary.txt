  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for generating a table of contents and numbered headings in an HTML document. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk (around 0.1) are justified and consistent with its behavior."
