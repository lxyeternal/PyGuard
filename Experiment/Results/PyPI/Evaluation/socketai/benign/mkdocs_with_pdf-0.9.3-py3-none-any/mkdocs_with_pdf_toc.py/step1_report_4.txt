{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate a table of contents and ordered headings within an HTML document, likely for document structuring or formatting purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads from the DOM object 'soup', specifically locating heading tags ('h1', 'h2', 'h3') and their attributes, as well as options from the 'Options' object. Also reads from logger for info/debug logs.",
  "sinks": "Creates new HTML tags (ul, li, a, span) and inserts them into the DOM. Uses get and set operations on DOM elements but no direct untrusted input handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Extracts heading elements, processes their IDs and contents, and constructs nested lists as a table of contents. Inserts generated TOC at the start of the body. Adds ordered numbering spans to headings based on options.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. No evident data exfiltration, network activity, or system modifications. No obfuscated code or misleading dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs DOM manipulations to generate a TOC and numbered headings based on document structure. It uses provided options for configuration and logs info/debug messages. No external system interactions, network calls, or sensitive data handling are present. Functions are straightforward, with no evidence of malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for document processing, focusing on enhancing structure and navigation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code.",
