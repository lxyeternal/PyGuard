  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent content processing module for PDF generation with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the dynamic theme module import from external paths, which could be exploited if paths are manipulated. The script injection points are controlled and do not execute untrusted code directly. Overall, the code is safe in a trusted environment, with a low risk score of 0.2."
