  "purpose": "Generate cover and back cover pages by rendering templates with provided keywords and inserting the resulting HTML into the DOM.",
  "sources": "Template selection via options.template.select(), template.render(keywords), and options.logger.info/error calls.",
  "sinks": "Insertion of rendered HTML into soup.body (insert or append), which could be exploited if templates are malicious or untrusted.",
  "flows": "template.render(keywords) produces HTML -> BeautifulSoup parses HTML -> inserted into soup.body at position 0 or end.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious external calls. Exception handling only logs errors without altering flow.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward template rendering and DOM manipulation with no evident malicious activity. It relies on external templates which, if compromised, could introduce risks, but this is external to the code. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The exception handling is standard. The security and malware scores are consistent with the absence of malicious or suspicious code. The main external risk is trust in templates, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe HTML template rendering utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, assuming trusted templates. No modifications are necessary.",
