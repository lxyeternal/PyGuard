  "purpose": "The code generates cover and back cover pages for a document by rendering templates and inserting them into an HTML structure.",
  "sources": "Options object providing template data and keywords, and potential input data passed to template.render()",
  "sinks": "soup_template = BeautifulSoup(template.render(keywords), 'html.parser') and insertion into soup.body",
  "flows": "Options.template.select() retrieves templates -> template.render(keywords) generates HTML -> BeautifulSoup parses HTML -> inserted into soup.body",
  "anomalies": "Use of template.render() without validation of its output, possible reliance on untrusted template content; no evident malicious code or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code reads template configurations and keywords from options, then renders HTML content using those templates. It inserts the rendered content into the DOM. There is no evidence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The template.render() method could, in theory, be misused if templates are compromised, but this is standard templating behavior. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard HTML template rendering and DOM manipulation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe assuming the templates and options are from trusted sources.",
