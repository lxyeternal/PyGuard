      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe configuration class with no malicious intent. The primary security consideration is the external dependency on user-supplied paths, which could be exploited if malicious binaries are placed at those locations. The malware score is 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. The risk score can be slightly increased to 0.2 to reflect this potential external risk, but overall, the code is safe."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent content processing module for PDF generation with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the dynamic theme module import from external paths, which could be exploited if paths are manipulated. The script injection points are controlled and do not execute untrusted code directly. Overall, the code is safe in a trusted environment, with a low risk score of 0.2."

The environment variable controls are standard and do not introduce security concerns. The scoring of malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) is justified and consistent with the analysis."

The main issues are implementation bugs (incorrect 'raise' and missing parentheses in 'uuid4'), which do not imply malicious intent. The assigned malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1), consistent with the analysis. No malicious behavior or security threats are present."
