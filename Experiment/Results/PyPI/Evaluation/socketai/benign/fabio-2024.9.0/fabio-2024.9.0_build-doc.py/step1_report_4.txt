  "purpose": "The script is designed to build Sphinx documentation for a project by preparing the environment and invoking the Sphinx build process.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath(__file__), bootstrap.get_project_name(PROJECT_DIR), bootstrap.build_project(PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_DIR), environment variables (implied), and filesystem (directory checks and creation).",
  "sinks": "sys.path.insert(0, LIBPATH), main(argv) call which executes Sphinx build, and os.makedirs() for directory creation.",
  "flows": "The script reads its own file path to determine project directory -> calls bootstrap functions to get project info and build dependencies -> modifies sys.path with LIBPATH -> constructs arguments for Sphinx -> calls main(argv) to generate documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. Usage of bootstrap functions is external, but no malicious behavior indicated. The code dynamically constructs paths and invokes external build process. The print statement exposes internal arguments, which is not inherently malicious but could reveal build details.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and custom bootstrap functions to set up a documentation build environment. It determines project paths, ensures the output directory exists, and invokes Sphinx's main build function with constructed arguments. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications. The print statement only outputs build arguments and does not execute or inject code. All operations appear to be related to a legitimate documentation build process. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward script to automate Sphinx documentation building. It uses external bootstrap functions whose implementations are not provided but are presumed to be legitimate. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks in the visible code.",
