  "purpose": "Builds project documentation using Sphinx, setting up paths and directories before invoking the build process.",
  "sources": "External bootstrap functions (`get_project_name`, `build_project`), project directory, source documentation path.",
  "sinks": "Sphinx's `main` function (build process), print statement outputting build arguments.",
  "flows": "Bootstrap functions provide project info -> sys.path is modified -> build directory is created -> arguments are constructed -> `main(argv)` is called to generate documentation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external bootstrap functions without source code; print statement reveals build arguments; no input validation or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward documentation build script. It determines project paths via external functions, modifies sys.path, creates necessary directories, and invokes Sphinx's build process. No suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The bootstrap functions' legitimacy is assumed; no secrets or credentials are hardcoded. The print statement only outputs build parameters. Overall, the script appears benign and standard for project documentation generation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign build utility for documentation with no malicious intent or obfuscation. External bootstrap functions are a potential concern if malicious, but no evidence suggests this. The code's behavior and structure are consistent with safe, legitimate use.",
