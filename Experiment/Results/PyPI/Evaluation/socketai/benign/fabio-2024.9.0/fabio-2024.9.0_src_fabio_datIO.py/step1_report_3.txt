{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for handling and reading data, particularly from files, in the context of a scientific imaging project.",
  "sources": "User-supplied filename in the read method of the columnfile class",
  "sinks": "Reading from files; no direct output or data transmission mechanisms shown",
  "flows": "Filename input -> file open -> data read -> data stored in class attributes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious backdoors; no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors present",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical scientific data handling module. It includes standard class definitions and file I/O operations, with proper exception handling. The read method in columnfile accesses external files, but there is no indication of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or embedded malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific data processing module with no malicious intent. It performs file reading operations typical for its domain and lacks suspicious or malicious behavior. No supply chain risks are evident.",
