{
  "purpose": "The code handles EDF file reading/writing, including headers, binary data, decompression, and multi-frame support, primarily for scientific imaging purposes.",
  "sources": "Header keys such as 'EDF_BinaryFileName', 'EDF_BinaryFileSize', 'EDF_BinaryFilePosition', 'SIZE', 'DATATYPE', 'BYTEORDER', and data buffers read from files or external binary files.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted header values could lead to reading arbitrary files if headers are maliciously crafted; data is read from files or buffers, but no direct data leaks or network activity are present.",
  "flows": "Header parsing extracts metadata -> header keys determine binary file paths and sizes -> data is read from file or external binary files based on header info -> decompression and byte swapping are applied -> data is unpacked into numpy arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard header parsing, decompression, and file I/O; no obfuscation or hidden code; external file paths could be manipulated if headers are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard EDF file handling, including header parsing, multi-frame support, external binary file reading, decompression, and byte swapping. It uses well-known libraries and practices, with robust error handling and logging. No malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity is detected. External file references via header keys are typical for the format but could be exploited if headers are maliciously crafted. Overall, the code is well-structured and safe for its intended scientific purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured EDF file parser with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The main security consideration is the potential for header manipulation to specify arbitrary file paths, which is inherent to the format but not indicative of malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is 0.2, reflecting standard operational risks.",
