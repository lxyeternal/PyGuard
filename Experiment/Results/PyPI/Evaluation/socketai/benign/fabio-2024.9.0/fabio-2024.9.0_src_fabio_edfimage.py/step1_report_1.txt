{
  "purpose": "The code implements reading and writing functionalities for EDF and related image formats, including handling headers, binary data, and multi-frame support. It facilitates file parsing, data extraction, and image manipulation within the scientific imaging domain.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include file objects (infile), header dictionaries, and external binary files specified by header keys. Data is read from binary streams, external files (possibly compressed), and header key-value pairs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing binary data and headers to files, and reading data into numpy arrays. Data leaks could occur if untrusted external binary files are read without validation, especially from 'EDF_BinaryFileName' paths. No direct network connections or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Sources include file reads (infile, external files), header dictionary inputs, and header keys. Data flows through unpacking binary streams into numpy arrays, possible decompression, byte swapping, and into numpy data structures. Header key-value parsing flows into header dictionaries. Sinks include writing header + binary data to output files, and returning numpy arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code signatures are evident. The code performs extensive logging and header parsing. No obfuscated code patterns are present. No unusual dynamic execution, malicious payloads, or external network activity is detected. Compression handling is standard and based on known schemes.",
  "analysis": "The code carefully manages file reading, header parsing, and binary data unpacking, with proper error handling and logging. It supports decompression and byte swapping based on header info. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or suspicious behaviors are identified. All external file accesses are tied to header-specified filenames, with safe handling of gzip and external binary files. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors. Use of numpy for data processing is standard. The code appears to be well-structured for scientific data I/O without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a scientific data parser for EDF files with multi-frame support. It performs standard header parsing, binary data handling, and file I/O operations. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are detected. It appears to be legitimate software intended for scientific imaging with appropriate safeguards. The malware score is low, and security risks are minimal.",
