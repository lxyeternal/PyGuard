  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration script for documentation with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The fallback import pattern is common and not inherently malicious, though it warrants trust in the local 'mathjax' module. Overall, the security risk is negligible, and malware likelihood is zero."
