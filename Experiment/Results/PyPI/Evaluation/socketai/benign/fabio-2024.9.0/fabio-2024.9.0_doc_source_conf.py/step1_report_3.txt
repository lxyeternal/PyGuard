  "purpose": "Configuration script for building documentation using Sphinx for the FabIO project.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as sys, os, fabio, sphinx.ext.mathjax, mathjax, sphinx.ext, and version information from fabio.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows to untrusted external systems or sensitive sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The script primarily sets up environment and configuration variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import of mathjax module fallback is somewhat unusual, but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. The import and use of third-party modules are standard for documentation build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a configuration setup for Sphinx documentation, importing modules, setting parameters, and handling exceptions during import. The fallback mechanism for 'sphinx.ext.mathjax' involves importing a local 'mathjax' module if the standard extension isn't available, which is typical fallback behavior. No code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity is observed. All operations relate to setting up documentation build environment. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign configuration file for documentation build; it does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It performs standard setup tasks with a fallback for missing modules. No security risks or malware signals are identified.",
