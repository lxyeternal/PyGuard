{
  "purpose": "Define and handle version information for the software, including version strings, info tuples, and hexadecimal encoding.",
  "sources": "Reads version metadata from internal constants and module variables; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing or external output that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "Version info constants flow into string formatting and the calc_hexversion function, which computes the hex version number.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages version information with static constants, formatted strings, and a function to compute a hex version number. It does not process external input, nor does it perform any network, file, or system modifications. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a standard version management module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign version handling module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages internal version data and performs a calculation to generate a numeric version identifier. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
