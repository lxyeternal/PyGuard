{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information and utility functions for handling version numbers of the software project.",
  "sources": "The code sources version-related constants (__date__, version_info, version, debianversion, strictversion, hexversion) and imports from collections.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code constructs version strings and computes a hex version number from predefined constants; no data flow from external or untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code strictly handles version information and performs simple calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard version management module, with clear definitions and calculations for software versioning. It includes functions to convert version components into a hexadecimal number and strings for version display. No input reading, network communication, or external data processing is present. The code does not contain any obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious constructs. It is well-structured, with no anomalies that suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version handling utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It strictly manages version info and performs simple calculations without external inputs or outputs. The overall security risk is minimal.",
