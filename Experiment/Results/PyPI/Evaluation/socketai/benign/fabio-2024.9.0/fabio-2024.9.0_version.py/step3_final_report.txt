{
  "purpose": "This code manages version information for a software project, defining constants, version strings, and a function to compute a hexadecimal version number based on static, predefined data.",
  "sources": "Internal constants and variables defining version components and version strings.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data that could lead to leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted sources; the function transforms static version info into a hex number without external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static version management utility, with no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It performs simple calculations and string formatting based on predefined constants. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The functions and constants are well-documented and serve their purpose without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a version information utility. It contains no malicious or obfuscated content, and the security risk is minimal. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
