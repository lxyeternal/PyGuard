{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information and utility functions for managing software version numbers, including calculating a hexadecimal representation of the version.",
  "sources": "Constants and variables defining version components, such as MAJOR, MINOR, MICRO, RELEV, SERIAL, and version info derived from these.",
  "sinks": "None identifiable; no untrusted data is used in sensitive operations or outputs.",
  "flows": "The code uses predefined version components to compute version strings and a hex version number, but there are no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated constructs or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The script is a version management module that sets version-related variables and computes a hexversion from version components. It relies solely on hardcoded constants and simple calculations. No user input, network activity, or untrusted data sources are involved. The functions and logic are standard for version handling. The __main__ block only prints the version string, which is static and generated internally. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign versioning utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured version management script. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
