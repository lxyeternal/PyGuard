{
  "purpose": "This code manages and defines version information for the software, including functions to calculate hexadecimal version numbers and formatted version strings.",
  "sources": "Reads version components (major, minor, micro, release level, serial) from internal variables and predefined constants.",
  "sinks": "Uses standard string formatting and integer operations; no sinks involve untrusted input or data that could lead to leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Defines version data, processes version components to generate version strings and hex values, and outputs version info on execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The only processing involves version info calculations, which are safe.",
  "analysis": "The code purely handles version metadata and calculations without external data input, network activity, or code execution beyond basic arithmetic and string formatting. It appears standard and benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The calculation of hexversion and version strings is straightforward. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version management module for a software project. It performs benign operations related to version info and has no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
