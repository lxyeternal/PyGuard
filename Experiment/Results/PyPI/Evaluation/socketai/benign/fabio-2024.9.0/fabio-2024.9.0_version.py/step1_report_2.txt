{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information and utility functions for handling software version numbers.",
  "sources": "Reads static variables (__date__, version_info), constants (RELEASE_LEVEL_VALUE, PRERELEASE_NORMALIZED_NAME), and environment/config data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data. No network, file, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical operations. The only flow is from predefined constants and version info to calculations and output.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward version management. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated or dynamic code, and no suspicious operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a version utility module that calculates and formats version information for a software project. It uses static data and simple arithmetic functions to produce version numbers in multiple formats. There are no external data inputs, network activities, or complex logic. The only function, calc_hexversion, performs a basic calculation based on parameters, which are supplied internally. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version handling module with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely provides version information and formatting functions for a software project. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are present.",
