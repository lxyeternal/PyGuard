{
  "purpose": "The code is an extension for Sphinx documentation generator that integrates MathJax for rendering mathematical expressions in HTML output.",
  "sources": "Configuration values such as 'mathjax_path', 'mathjax_inline', and 'mathjax_display'; external JavaScript loaded via app.add_javascript.",
  "sinks": "Loading external JavaScript from a URL; potentially injecting user-defined LaTeX code into HTML output.",
  "flows": "The extension loads MathJax JavaScript from a specified URL during build initialization; user-provided LaTeX content is encoded and embedded into HTML with MathJax delimiters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; the code loads external scripts without validation; LaTeX content is encoded but not sanitized beyond encoding, though this is standard for LaTeX rendering.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines functions to generate HTML for math expressions, and loads external MathJax JavaScript via a configurable URL. It performs checks on configuration values, raises errors if necessary, and attaches functions to process inline and display math. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious logic is present. The external script URL is configurable, which could be manipulated, but this is typical for such extensions. The LaTeX content is encoded for HTML safety. Overall, the code functions as a Sphinx extension with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Sphinx extension for MathJax integration. It loads external scripts based on configuration and processes LaTeX content for rendering. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The code appears safe within its intended purpose.",
