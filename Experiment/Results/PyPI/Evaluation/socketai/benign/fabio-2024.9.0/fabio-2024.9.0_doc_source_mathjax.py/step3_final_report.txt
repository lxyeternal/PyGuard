  "purpose": "Integrate MathJax support into Sphinx HTML output, loading external MathJax scripts and rendering LaTeX expressions.",
  "sources": "Configuration value 'mathjax_path' for script URL; LaTeX content in 'node['latex']' fields.",
  "sinks": "Embedding LaTeX into HTML spans/divs; loading external JavaScript from CDN.",
  "flows": "Configuration value used to load script -> LaTeX content encoded -> inserted into HTML elements for rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious code, proper validation of configuration, LaTeX encoding applied.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx extension for MathJax support. It loads external scripts from a configurable URL, defaulting to a trusted CDN, and encodes LaTeX content to prevent injection. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The external script URL is configurable, which could be manipulated if misconfigured, but defaults are safe. LaTeX encoding mitigates injection risks. No network activity beyond loading the CDN script is suspicious. The code performs validation of configuration parameters and handles LaTeX rendering appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard extension for MathJax integration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. External script loading is from a trusted source, and LaTeX content is safely encoded. The overall security risk is minimal.",
