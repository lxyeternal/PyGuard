{
  "purpose": "The code extends the Sphinx documentation generator to include MathJax support for rendering mathematical expressions in HTML output.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration values (e.g., mathjax_path), and processes 'latex' data from nodes.",
  "sinks": "The code appends JavaScript resources to the document and encodes latex content, but does not perform any data writes to external systems or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Configuration data (mathjax_path) flows into builder_inited, which then loads external JavaScript; latex content flows from nodes into the HTML output via encoding, but does not execute as code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code loads external scripts via a fixed URL but this is standard for including MathJax. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx extension to include MathJax for rendering math formulas. It performs input encoding for latex expressions and appends external JavaScript resources. The external URL for MathJax is hardcoded but is a common CDN link, not malicious. No data leakage, credential handling, or malicious code execution is detected. The code raises errors if the configuration is incomplete and integrates with the Sphinx build process properly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical extension for adding MathJax support in Sphinx documentation. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its design and implementation are aligned with common practices for such extensions.",
