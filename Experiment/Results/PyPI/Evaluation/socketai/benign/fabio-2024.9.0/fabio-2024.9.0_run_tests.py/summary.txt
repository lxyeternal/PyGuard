  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard Python test runner with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal (score ~0.2), primarily due to dynamic module handling, but no actual malicious activity is detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is low. The existing reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate."
