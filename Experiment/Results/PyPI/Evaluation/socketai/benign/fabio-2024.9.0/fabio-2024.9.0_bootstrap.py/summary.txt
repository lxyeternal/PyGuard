  "conclusion": "The script does not contain active malware or obfuscation but relies heavily on dynamic code execution, which poses security risks if misused. The potential for malicious exploitation exists if untrusted inputs are provided, especially via execfile, exec(), or subprocess with environment variables. The overall security risk is moderate to high, warranting caution and input validation when deploying in untrusted contexts."
