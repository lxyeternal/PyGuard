  "purpose": "A utility script for testing, executing, and building Python projects with dynamic code execution and environment manipulation.",
  "sources": "pyproject.toml, environment variables, script files, user input, sys.argv",
  "sinks": "execfile, subprocess.Popen, exec(), importlib.import_module, code.interact()",
  "flows": "Input data from environment variables, command-line arguments, and files into code execution points",
  "anomalies": "Use of execfile, exec(), dynamic import, and interactive shell without validation or sanitization",
  "analysis": "The code employs dynamic execution methods such as execfile and exec(), as well as subprocess calls and importlib for runtime module loading. It reads configuration from pyproject.toml and environment variables, and manipulates sys.argv and sys.path to control execution flow. No malicious payloads or backdoors are present; however, the use of unvalidated dynamic code execution points creates a significant attack surface if inputs are malicious. The code is straightforward and intended for development/testing purposes, but its flexibility can be exploited in untrusted environments.",
  "conclusion": "The script does not contain active malware or obfuscation but relies heavily on dynamic code execution, which poses security risks if misused. The potential for malicious exploitation exists if untrusted inputs are provided, especially via execfile, exec(), or subprocess with environment variables. The overall security risk is moderate to high, warranting caution and input validation when deploying in untrusted contexts.",
