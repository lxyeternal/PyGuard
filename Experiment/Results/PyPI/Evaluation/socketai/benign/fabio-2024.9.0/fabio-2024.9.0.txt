      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The script does not contain active malware or obfuscation but relies heavily on dynamic code execution, which poses security risks if misused. The potential for malicious exploitation exists if untrusted inputs are provided, especially via execfile, exec(), or subprocess with environment variables. The overall security risk is moderate to high, warranting caution and input validation when deploying in untrusted contexts."

      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard Python test runner with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal (score ~0.2), primarily due to dynamic module handling, but no actual malicious activity is detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is low. The existing reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate."

External bootstrap functions are a potential concern if malicious, but no evidence suggests this. The code's behavior and structure are consistent with safe, legitimate use."

The fallback import pattern is common and not inherently malicious, though it warrants trust in the local 'mathjax' module. Overall, the security risk is negligible, and malware likelihood is zero."

The main security consideration is the potential for header manipulation to specify arbitrary file paths, which is inherent to the format but not indicative of malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is 0.2, reflecting standard operational risks."

The existing assessments are accurate and justified."
