  "purpose": "Class HipicImage reads HiPic image files from Hamamatsu CCD cameras by parsing binary headers and loading image data into numpy arrays.",
  "sources": "File stream 'infile' reading binary header fields and image data.",
  "sinks": "Header dictionary updates, numpy array creation from binary data.",
  "flows": "File read -> header parsing -> data buffer reading -> numpy.frombuffer -> reshape into image array.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Commented-out code for negative value correction is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard binary file parsing: reading fixed-size binary fields, decoding strings, and reshaping raw data into images. It includes header validation and logging warnings for corrupt headers. No external network calls, code injection, or obfuscation are present. The commented-out data correction code is typical in image processing and does not introduce vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward implementation for reading HiPic image files. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate given its purpose as a file parser. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0.",
