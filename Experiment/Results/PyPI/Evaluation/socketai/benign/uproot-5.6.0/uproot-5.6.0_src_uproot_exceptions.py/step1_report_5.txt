{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exceptions and warnings related to ROOT file handling in the uproot library, specifically for missing keys and key conflicts.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided through the parameters of the KeyInFileError constructor, such as key, because, cycle, keys, file_path, object_path.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method generates formatted strings for display or logging, potentially exposing internal file paths, object paths, and key lists.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the __init__ constructor, stored as object attributes, then used in __str__ to create output strings that could be displayed or logged.",
  "anomalies": "The __str__ method involves sorting keys with a Damerau-Levenshtein distance function and dynamically constructs output strings; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a custom exception class with detailed string representation for debugging. It handles parameters related to ROOT file structure and missing keys, without executing any external commands, network access, or malicious actions. The use of string formatting and sorting is standard. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a custom exception with detailed error reporting for the uproot library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
