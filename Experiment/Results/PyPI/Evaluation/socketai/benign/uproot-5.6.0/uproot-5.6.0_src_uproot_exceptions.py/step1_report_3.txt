{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exceptions for handling errors related to ROOT file object lookups within the uproot library.",
  "sources": "The code reads class instantiations and method calls, particularly within the __init__ and __str__ methods, and accesses attributes such as self.key, self.because, self.cycle, self.keys, self.file_path, and self.object_path.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method constructs string messages that could potentially be logged or displayed, but does not perform any system calls, network operations, or unsafe data handling.",
  "flows": "Input data (attributes set during exception instantiation) flows into the __str__ method to generate descriptive error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behavior are present. Usage of uproot._util.damerau_levenshtein indicates reliance on an external utility function, but without its implementation, no malicious intent can be inferred.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions. The __str__ method generates detailed error messages based on exception attributes, including optional keys and file paths. No data is sent over networks, executed dynamically, or accessed from untrusted sources. No suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be standard exception handling logic with informative messaging.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured exception class implementation for handling ROOT file errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code fragment.",
