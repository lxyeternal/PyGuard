{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exceptions for handling specific ROOT file errors in the uproot package.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from constructor parameters such as key, because, cycle, keys, file_path, object_path, and potentially from the uproot._util module for string comparison.",
  "sinks": "None of the code appears to directly process or output untrusted data to external systems, nor does it perform network or file operations directly.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned and used primarily within __init__ and __str__ methods for formatting output messages; no external untrusted data flows into or out of the code.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a sorting function with a string similarity metric (damerau_levenshtein) within __str__, but this is for formatting purposes only, not for security-critical operations. No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes with detailed string representations for error messages. The __str__ method constructs human-readable messages based on internal state and parameters, including potential lengthy key lists. The use of the external utility for string similarity is benign and only for display purposes. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. No sensitive data handling, network activity, or external command execution occurs.",
  "conclusion": "This module primarily provides exception handling and formatted error reporting. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely within the context of exception management for the uproot package.",
