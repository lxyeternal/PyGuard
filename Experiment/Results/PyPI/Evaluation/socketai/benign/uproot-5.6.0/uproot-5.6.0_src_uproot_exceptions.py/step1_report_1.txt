{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for the Uproot library, specifically for handling key errors related to ROOT files.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily from exception parameters such as 'key', 'because', 'cycle', 'keys', 'file_path', and 'object_path'.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method generates a string representation that may include data from the parameters, especially 'keys', 'file_path', and 'object_path'.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the __str__ method, which constructs a formatted message; no external data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The code primarily performs string formatting and sorting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions. The __str__ method constructs a detailed error message that includes sorted keys based on a string similarity metric, which is a normal utility function. No malicious or suspicious behaviors, network activities, or security risks are evident. Usage of 'uproot._util.damerau_levenshtein' suggests dependency on a utility function for string similarity, which is benign here. Overall, the code is standard for exception handling and message formatting with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for the Uproot library, involving safe string manipulations and sorting. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities.",
