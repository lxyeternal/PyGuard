{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for Uproot, including detailed error messaging and key sorting for user clarity.",
  "sources": "Attributes such as 'keys', 'file_path', 'object_path', and 'cycle' used in string formatting within __str__ method.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, network activity, or unsafe operations; primarily string manipulation and sorting.",
  "flows": "Input attributes flow into formatted error messages; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'uproot._util.damerau_levenshtein' for sorting keys is benign; no suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward class definitions for exceptions, with a __str__ method that formats messages based on internal attributes. The only external utility used is a string similarity function for ordering keys, which is safe and for display purposes only. No external data, network calls, or obfuscation are present. The logic is standard and secure, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exceptions for the Uproot library, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the original reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
