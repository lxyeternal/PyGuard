{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for Uproot, specifically for handling errors related to ROOT file object lookups.",
  "sources": "None. The code only defines classes and imports; it does not read external data or inputs.",
  "sinks": "None. The code does not perform any data output, network operations, or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "None. No data flow from sources to sinks exists as the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious patterns are present. The code uses standard exception inheritance and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports uproot and defines custom exception classes, including a detailed __str__ method for exception messages. It includes no data processing, network communication, or environment manipulation. The __str__ method formats error messages based on internal attributes but does not execute any external or dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward definition of custom exceptions for error handling within the Uproot package. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
