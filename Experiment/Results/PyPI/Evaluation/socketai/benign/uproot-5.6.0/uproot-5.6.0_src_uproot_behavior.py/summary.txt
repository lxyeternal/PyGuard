  "conclusion": "The code is a controlled plugin loader that employs dynamic import techniques common in extensible systems. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The primary concern is the use of exec() and eval(), which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted, but within a controlled environment, this risk is minimal. Scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.2-0.3."
