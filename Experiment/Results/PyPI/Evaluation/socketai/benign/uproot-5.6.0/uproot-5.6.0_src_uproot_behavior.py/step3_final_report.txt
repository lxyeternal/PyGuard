{
  "purpose": "Dynamically loads behavior classes for C++ ROOT objects based on encoded class names, using runtime import and class retrieval.",
  "sources": "Class name encoding function, module list from pkgutil.walk_packages, class name strings used in exec() and getattr().",
  "sinks": "exec() for module import, eval() for module reference, getattr() for class retrieval.",
  "flows": "Class name encoding -> module name determination -> exec() import -> getattr() to get class -> optional instantiation with specialization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() and eval() with data derived from class name encoding; no hardcoded secrets or network activity; straightforward plugin pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code encodes C++ class names, searches for corresponding modules, imports them dynamically via exec(), retrieves classes via getattr(), and caches them in globals(). It applies specializations if class names end with known suffixes. The use of exec() and eval() introduces potential security risks if class names are influenced by untrusted sources. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The pattern is standard for plugin systems, with risks manageable if inputs are controlled. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.2-0.3) considering the dynamic execution functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a controlled plugin loader that employs dynamic import techniques common in extensible systems. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The primary concern is the use of exec() and eval(), which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted, but within a controlled environment, this risk is minimal. Scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.2-0.3.",
