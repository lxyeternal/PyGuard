  "conclusion": "The primary security vulnerability in this code is the use of `exec()` to run `class_code` without validation, posing a high risk of remote code execution if `class_code` is supplied from untrusted sources. The current malware and security risk scores underestimate this danger; they should be increased to approximately 0.8 to reflect the severity. Proper validation, sanitization, or sandboxing should be implemented to mitigate this critical supply chain security risk."
