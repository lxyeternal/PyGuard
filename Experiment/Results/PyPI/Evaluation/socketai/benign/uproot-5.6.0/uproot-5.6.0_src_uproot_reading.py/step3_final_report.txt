  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for securely opening, reading, and deserializing ROOT files, handling file headers, directories, keys, and streamers. It manages data flow from file input to object reconstruction while supporting custom class definitions and resource management.",
  "sources": "File headers, seek points, directory entries, keys, streamer info, and class definitions within the ROOT file.",
  "sinks": "Deserialized ROOT objects, class schemas, and data structures used in high-energy physics analysis.",
  "flows": "File input streams → header parsing → directory and key reading → streamer interpretation → object deserialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The code relies on standard deserialization routines and user-defined classes, which are inherent to ROOT's design.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation for reading ROOT files, with clear separation of concerns and resource management. It performs deserialization of potentially untrusted data but does not execute arbitrary code, connect to networks, or contain hidden backdoors. The class handling and deserialization routines are typical for such libraries, and no malicious patterns or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure ROOT file reader with no malicious intent or sabotage elements. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1-0.2 are appropriate and justified based on its functionality and structure.",
