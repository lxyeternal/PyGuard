  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of safe, transparent utility functions with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The potential for exploitation exists only if inputs are maliciously crafted, but the code itself does not perform any harmful operations. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1, consistent with the analysis."
