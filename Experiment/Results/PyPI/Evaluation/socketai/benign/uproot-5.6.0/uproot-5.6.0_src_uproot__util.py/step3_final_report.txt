  "purpose": "Utility functions for internal use, including data type checks, path normalization, regex filtering, file handling, and data conversions.",
  "sources": "Path and URL parsing, regex pattern matching, file object attributes, environment variables, and user-provided input for regex and path functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, code execution, or data exfiltration are present. Path and regex handling could be misused if inputs are maliciously crafted, but no actual malicious activity is evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (paths, regex patterns, file objects) flow through normalization, pattern matching, and data conversion functions without executing untrusted code or performing harmful operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of extensive regex patterns, dynamic class creation, and path manipulations could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions for data type validation, path normalization, regex filtering, file handling, and data conversions. It avoids dangerous operations such as code execution, network activity, or dynamic code evaluation. Regex and glob patterns are used for pattern matching and path expansion, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but no such exploitation is evident in the code. The functions are straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The malware score is therefore 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk is very low, around 0.1-0.2, reflecting potential misuse if inputs are crafted maliciously but no active threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of safe, transparent utility functions with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The potential for exploitation exists only if inputs are maliciously crafted, but the code itself does not perform any harmful operations. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1, consistent with the analysis.",
