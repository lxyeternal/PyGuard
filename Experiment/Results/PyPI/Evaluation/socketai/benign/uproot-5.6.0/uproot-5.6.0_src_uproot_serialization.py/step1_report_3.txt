{
  "purpose": "Provides low-level serialization functions for writing ROOT-compatible data structures to files, including string encoding and object serialization.",
  "sources": "Input strings to `string()` and `bytestring()`; data passed to `numbytes_version()` and `serialize_object_any()` functions; potentially untrusted object models passed to `_serialize_object_any()`.",
  "sinks": "Binary data packed with `struct.pack()`; data stored in byte arrays; output of serialization functions that could be written to files or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input data from `string()`, `bytestring()`, `numbytes_version()`, and object models flows through packing functions into binary formats; `_serialize_object_any()` adds serialized object data to output list; `serialize_object_any()` joins all byte chunks into final output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. No hardcoded secrets, no reflective or dynamic code execution, no external network or system calls. Functions perform straightforward serialization tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard serialization operations: encoding strings, packing length-prefixed bytes, creating versioned headers, and serializing object models. It uses struct for binary packing, numpy for integer handling, and standard encoding for strings. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious data handling. The data flows are predictable, with no external interactions or sensitive data extraction. All functions are typical for serialization libraries, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard serialization implementation for ROOT data formats, with no malicious behavior detected. It does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious code segments, nor does it perform any network or system modifications. The code appears safe and intended for normal serialization purposes.",
