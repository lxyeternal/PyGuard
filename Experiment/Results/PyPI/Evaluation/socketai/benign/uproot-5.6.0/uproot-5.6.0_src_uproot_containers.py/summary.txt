  "conclusion": "The module is a typical, well-structured deserialization library for ROOT C++ containers. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The main risk stems from the potential for maliciously crafted ROOT files with malicious class names, which is an inherent risk in deserialization of external data but not a flaw in the code. Overall, the code is safe for use in trusted environments, with the caveat of validating input data."
