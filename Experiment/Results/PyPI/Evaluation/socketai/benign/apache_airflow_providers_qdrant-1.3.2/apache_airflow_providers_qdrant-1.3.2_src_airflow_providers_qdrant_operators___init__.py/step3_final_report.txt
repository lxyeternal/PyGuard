  "purpose": "This code snippet contains only licensing comments with no executable code or data processing, serving as a license header.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only comments present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only comments with no runtime behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; purely licensing comments with standard formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license header comments, with no executable code, data processing, or input/output operations. No sources, sinks, or data flows are present. The comments are standard licensing boilerplate, and there are no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, with high confidence in this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign licensing boilerplate with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify the absence of executable code and assign appropriate scores. No further action is necessary.",
