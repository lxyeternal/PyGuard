  "purpose": "This code initializes version checks and imports for an Apache Airflow provider module, ensuring compatibility with specific Airflow versions.",
  "sources": "Imports `packaging.version`, retrieves `airflow.__version__`",
  "sinks": "Runtime version comparison and potential RuntimeError triggering",
  "flows": "Import of airflow version -> version comparison -> conditional error raising",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard version check and import statements",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard imports and version parsing to verify the Airflow environment. It uses safe import statements, version comparison via the packaging library, and raises a RuntimeError if the version requirement isn't met. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, automatically generated version compatibility check with no malicious intent or security issues.",
