{
  "purpose": "This code initializes version control and compatibility checks for an Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring proper environment setup before use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version imported from the airflow module and the package's own version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or data that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing version info, parsing version strings, to raising an exception if version requirements are not met.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The version comparison and runtime check are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines package metadata, and performs a version check on the airflow environment. It raises an error if the airflow version is below 2.9.0. No external inputs or malicious behavior detected; the code follows standard practices for version validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version check for compatibility; it does not contain malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and straightforward.",
