{
  "purpose": "This code snippet appears to be an automatically generated Python module that manages version compatibility for an Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring the installed Airflow version meets minimum requirements.",
  "sources": "Reads the imported 'airflow_version' from the airflow package and the 'packaging.version' module for version parsing.",
  "sinks": "Raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which is a standard control flow for version checks.",
  "flows": "Imports version info, compares the current Airflow version to a minimum required version, and raises an exception if the check fails.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs straightforward version validation with no hidden or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines the package version, and compares the current airflow version to a minimum threshold. If the version is insufficient, it raises an error. The code is simple, standard, and does not include any suspicious or malicious elements. No data is leaked, external network connections are not made, and no malicious code is embedded.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version compatibility check for an Apache Airflow provider package. It is well-structured, clear, and free of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
