{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a generated module that sets version information and enforces a minimum Apache Airflow version requirement for a specific provider package.",
  "sources": "Reads the `airflow` package's `__version__` attribute to determine the installed Airflow version.",
  "sinks": "Uses the `airflow_version` data to compare against a minimum required version and potentially raises a RuntimeError.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading the `airflow` package version, parsing it, comparing it to a threshold, and conditionally raising an error.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, uses standard library and package imports, and enforces version compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard generated Python script used for version checking. It imports necessary modules, defines a version string, and performs a comparison with a threshold. If the installed Airflow version is below 2.9.0, it raises an error to prevent incompatible usage. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code solely performs version validation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate version check for ensuring compatibility and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a standard pattern used in Python package validation.",
