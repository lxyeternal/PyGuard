{
  "purpose": "This code performs a version check for the apache-airflow-providers-qdrant package, ensuring the installed Airflow version meets the minimum requirement of 2.9.0.",
  "sources": "Reads the installed airflow.__version__ and the imported packaging.version module for version parsing.",
  "sinks": "Raises a RuntimeError if the airflow version is below 2.9.0, halting execution.",
  "flows": "Imports airflow version, compares it to the minimum required version, and raises an exception if incompatible.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard, auto-generated version validation script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, benign version check that imports the current airflow version, compares it with a specified minimum, and raises an exception if the version is too low. It uses standard modules and practices, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious data handling. The purpose is purely compatibility enforcement, common in package setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The exception raising is a standard safeguard, not an attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version validation script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its purpose and assign appropriate scores. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the security risk at 0, reflecting its safe, compatibility-focused nature.",
