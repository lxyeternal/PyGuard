{
  "purpose": "This code is part of an automatic generated file for an Apache Airflow provider package, primarily used for version validation and module exports.",
  "sources": "Imports 'packaging.version' and reads the 'airflow.__version__' attribute.",
  "sinks": "The runtime check compares 'airflow_version' to a specified version threshold, potentially raising an exception.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing dependencies to performing version comparison and conditionally raising an exception if requirements are not met.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures. The version check and import statements are standard; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and checks the version of Apache Airflow. If the version is below 2.9.0, it raises a RuntimeError. The code is standard for ensuring compatibility and does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic. It is automatically generated, and its purpose appears solely related to version validation and module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily used for compatibility checks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are detected.",
