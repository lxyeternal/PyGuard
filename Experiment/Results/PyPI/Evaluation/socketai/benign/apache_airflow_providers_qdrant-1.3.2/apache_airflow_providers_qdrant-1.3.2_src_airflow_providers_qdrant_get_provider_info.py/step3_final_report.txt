{
  "purpose": "Provides static metadata information about the 'apache-airflow-providers-qdrant' package, including versioning, documentation links, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The function get_provider_info() returns a hardcoded dictionary; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output external data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "The function simply returns static data; there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, auto-generated, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static function returning a predefined dictionary with package metadata. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or data processing. The code is typical for package configuration and documentation purposes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The confidence score of 1 is appropriate given the clarity and simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and serves as package metadata. There are no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
