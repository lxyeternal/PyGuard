  "purpose": "Provide metadata and configuration information for the Apache Airflow Qdrant provider package, including package details, versions, integrations, hooks, connection types, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data within the function get_provider_info() such as string literals, lists, dictionaries, and function return values.",
  "sinks": "Return statement output; no untrusted input is processed or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "Function call to return static dictionary; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and auto-generated documentation metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is an auto-generated Python function that returns a static dictionary containing package metadata and configuration details. No external input, environment variables, or user data is read. The code structure is simple, with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or unusual constructs. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The content is consistent with a typical package metadata provider.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely static, and serves as package configuration metadata. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks.",
