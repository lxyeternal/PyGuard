  "sources": "The code reads no external input or user data; it is static and self-contained, providing hardcoded metadata information.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code merely returns a static dictionary with package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected; the code is straightforward, includes licensing comments, and a function returning static metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Python function returning package metadata. It contains licensing comments, a function definition, and a return statement with a structured dictionary. There are no dynamic inputs, external data reads, or potentially unsafe operations. It appears to be auto-generated template code for package info, with no signs of obfuscated code or malicious behavior.",
