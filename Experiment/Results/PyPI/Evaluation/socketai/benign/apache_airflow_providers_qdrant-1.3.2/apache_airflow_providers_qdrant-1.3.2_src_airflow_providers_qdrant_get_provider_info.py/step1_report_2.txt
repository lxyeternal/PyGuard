{
  "purpose": "Define and return metadata information about the Apache Airflow provider package for Qdrant, including versions, dependencies, and integration details.",
  "sources": "None (the code is a static function returning a dictionary; no external input or data reading occurs).",
  "sinks": "None (the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects).",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the function simply returns static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard static configuration function with no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that returns a dictionary containing metadata about the 'apache-airflow-providers-qdrant' package, including its name, description, versions, dependencies, and integration info. It contains only static data and no executable code that interacts with external inputs, writes data, or performs network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The structure is straightforward and typical for a package metadata module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static metadata provider for the package, with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply supplies configuration information for documentation and package management purposes.",
