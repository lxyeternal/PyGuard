  "purpose": "This code is a license header comment from the Apache Software Foundation, providing licensing information and legal notices.",
  "sources": "The entire code consists of static comment lines; no data input or external sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows exist, as there is no executable code or data processing.",
  "flows": "No data or control flows are present; the code is purely comments.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation; the code is straightforward licensing boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard license header comment with no executable statements, data input/output, or suspicious behaviors. All reports correctly identify the content as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the static and well-understood nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign license header comment with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments to scores or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
