{
  "purpose": "To import and define classes related to aligned data structures for AnnData and Raw objects, with fallback mechanisms for different versions of the anndata library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'anndata' modules, especially the '_core.aligned_mapping' submodule, and class instantiations within custom class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no use of untrusted data, network operations, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes and, in case of import failure, defines subclasses that invoke superclass constructors. No external data flow or data processing evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. The code mainly handles version compatibility and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard import mechanisms with a fallback for older versions of the 'anndata' package. It conditionally imports classes and defines subclasses that wrap these imported classes, passing parameters to superclass constructors. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or secret handling present. The logic is straightforward, focusing on compatibility and class inheritance, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve as a compatibility layer for different versions of the 'anndata' library, defining classes to handle aligned data structures. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security risks. The code is well-structured and appears benign.",
