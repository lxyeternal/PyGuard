  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard import handling and class definitions for compatibility.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data output or untrusted data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Normal use of try-except for version compatibility.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, just compatibility code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign, straightforward.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious behavior)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)  \n- Risk: 0 (no security risk)  \n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on compatibility handling.  \n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) perhaps due to the fallback class definitions, but no actual vulnerabilities.  \n- Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (minor, probably overcautious)\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern, focusing on compatibility.  \n- No suspicious activity.  \n- Scores consistent with benign code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates the compatibility approach, no malicious activity.  \n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar, standard import and fallback pattern.  \n- No suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None.  \n- **Security risks:** Minimal, mainly due to compatibility handling, which is standard practice.\n\n### Final Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports; no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** Given the nature of the code (import handling, class inheritance, compatibility), the risk should be very low, around 0.0 to 0.1.\n\n### Additional Justification:\n- The code does not execute untrusted input, perform network operations, or handle secrets.\n- The fallback classes simply extend existing classes, passing parameters to constructors—nothing suspicious.\n- The use of try-except for imports is common for compatibility, not malicious obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (a very conservative, minimal risk due to compatibility handling, but not indicative of actual security concern)\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, benign, and serves a compatibility purpose. No adjustments needed to the scores beyond minor caution.",
