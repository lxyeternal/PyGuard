{
  "purpose": "The code defines compatibility wrappers and type annotations for the anndata package's aligned mapping classes, facilitating backward compatibility with older versions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes from anndata, including optional imports that fall back to legacy classes if newer ones are unavailable.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network operations, or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code mainly performs imports and class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import classes from anndata._core.aligned_mapping, with fallback to legacy classes if import fails. It then defines wrapper classes that extend legacy classes, passing parameters to their constructors. The purpose is to ensure compatibility across different anndata versions. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard compatibility layer for anndata, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code performs controlled imports and class extensions without any hidden or harmful operations.",
