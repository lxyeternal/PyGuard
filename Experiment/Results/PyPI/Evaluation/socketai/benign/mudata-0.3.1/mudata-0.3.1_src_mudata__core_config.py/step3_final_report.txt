  "purpose": "Manage MuData display options with validation and context management.",
  "sources": "Input options provided to the set_options constructor.",
  "sinks": "Updating the global OPTIONS dictionary; logging info messages.",
  "flows": "Constructor input -> validation lambdas -> OPTIONS update; context enter/exit -> log messages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; straightforward validation; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines default options and validation rules, then implements a context manager class to set options temporarily or permanently. Validation lambdas ensure correct values. The class updates a global OPTIONS dict and logs context changes. No external data flows, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's purpose is configuration management, not security-sensitive operations. Validation is simple and safe, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration utility for MuData options, with proper validation and context management. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
