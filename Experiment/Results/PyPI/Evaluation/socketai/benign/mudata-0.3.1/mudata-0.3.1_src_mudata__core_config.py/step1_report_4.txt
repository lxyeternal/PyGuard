{
  "purpose": "Manage and validate configuration options for MuData visualization settings, allowing context-specific and global option changes.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from constructor arguments (`kwargs`) in `set_options`, and from the `OPTIONS` and `_VALID_OPTIONS` dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "The options are updated into the global `OPTIONS` dictionary, which affects the behavior of MuData visualization.",
  "flows": "Constructor takes user-provided options -> validates options against `_VALID_OPTIONS` -> updates `OPTIONS` -> context management controls the application of options.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses lambdas for validation, which are straightforward. No suspicious code or hidden behaviors detected. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines default options and validation functions, then implements a context manager class to temporarily change options. Validation checks ensure options are valid before updating global state. No external inputs, network calls, or hidden behaviors are present. The code is primarily configuration management with input validation, not suspicious or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe configuration management utility for MuData options. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are present. It performs validation and context-based updates without unsafe operations.",
