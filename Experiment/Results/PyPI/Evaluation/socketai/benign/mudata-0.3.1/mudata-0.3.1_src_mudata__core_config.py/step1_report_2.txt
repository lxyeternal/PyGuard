  "purpose": "Defines a class and options for configuring MuData display settings with context management.",
  "sources": "Initialization of OPTIONS and _VALID_OPTIONS, __init__ method reading kwargs, and _apply method updating OPTIONS.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is sent externally or processed insecurely.",
  "flows": "User supplies options -> __init__ validates and sets options -> _apply updates global OPTIONS -> context manager logs info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; validation logic is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a context manager class to set and revert options for MuData display. It validates options against predefined allowed values. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The option validation uses simple lambda functions. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic detected. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious network activity present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for configuring display options with proper validation and context management. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent.",
