{
  "purpose": "Concatenates MuData objects, handling modalities, annotations, and metadata for multimodal datasets.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input MuData objects, their attributes (mod, var, uns, etc.), and parameters provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "Merges dataframes, arrays, and annotations; constructs and returns a new MuData object with combined data.",
  "flows": "Data flows through merging functions, attribute access, reindexing, and concatenation steps, culminating in the creation of a new MuData instance.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external communication detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries (numpy, pandas, anndata) and well-understood data processing patterns. It performs data merging, reindexing, and attribute updates in a straightforward manner. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or system modifications are present. The fallback import handling for anndata versions is standard practice. Overall, the implementation appears legitimate and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for concatenating MuData objects, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are justified and consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
