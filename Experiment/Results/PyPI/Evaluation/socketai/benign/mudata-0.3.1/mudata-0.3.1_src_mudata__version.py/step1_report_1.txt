{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ = version = '0.3.1') and the tuple definitions (__version_tuple__ and version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "The version string and tuple assignments are straightforward and static, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes conditional type annotations that are unused at runtime, which is normal for type hints. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily an autogenerated module that sets version information. It uses conditional type hints to support static type checking, which do not affect runtime behavior. The version string and tuple are statically assigned and do not involve external inputs or dangerous operations. There are no code injections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, autogenerated versioning module with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages package version data with no suspicious or harmful elements.",
