  "purpose": "This code defines version-related variables for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to manage package versioning information.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables, reading no external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Simple assignment of static version values to variables; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior present. The code includes a standard pattern for conditional typing support.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version variables for package metadata, with conditional typing support based on TYPE_CHECKING. It assigns fixed version values without any external input, user input, or untrusted data. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling is present. The code appears to be a standard auto-generated version info module typical for packaging tools, with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version management snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply assigns fixed version info variables used for package distribution.",
