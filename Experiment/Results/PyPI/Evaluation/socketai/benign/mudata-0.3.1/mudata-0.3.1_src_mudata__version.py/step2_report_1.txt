  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the actual code, then evaluate the scoring and overall security implications.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code is a straightforward, auto-generated version info module, assigning static version strings and tuples, with conditional type hints for static analysis.  \n- No external inputs, data flows, or dynamic code execution are present.  \n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n**Step 2: Review each report's reasoning**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, auto-generated, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.  \n- They correctly identify that the conditional `TYPE_CHECKING` block is standard for type hints and does not affect runtime behavior.  \n- No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate scores assigned in reports**\n\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which aligns with the code's nature.  \n- Confidence is 1, which is appropriate given the clear, straightforward code.  \n- No report suggests any issues that warrant raising the scores.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- The risk scores are all zero, which is justified because the code is purely for version info, with no external inputs, network activity, or executable logic.  \n- No reason to elevate the risk scores.\n\n**Step 5: Cross-validate malware score**\n\n- Since there's no malicious behavior, the malware score remains 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- All reports correctly assume the code is standard boilerplate for versioning, with no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, autogenerated version management snippet with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code is a standard version info module with no malicious or risky elements. The scoring and analysis are appropriate.",
