{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, used for package versioning.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignment to __version__ and version, as well as the tuple assignment to __version_tuple__ and version_tuple.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data input or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code assigns fixed version strings and tuples without involving external sources or user input.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a conditional type checking block which is standard; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward version declaration script, automatically generated by setuptools_scm. It sets version-related variables with fixed values. The use of TYPE_CHECKING is standard for type hinting purposes and does not introduce any malicious behavior. There are no external data inputs, no data flows from untrusted sources, and no suspicious logic or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version declaration script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines version variables for packaging purposes.",
