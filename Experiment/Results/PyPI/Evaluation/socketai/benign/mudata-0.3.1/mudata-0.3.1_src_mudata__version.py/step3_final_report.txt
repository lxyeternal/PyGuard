  "purpose": "Autogenerated version information module defining static version strings and tuples for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of fixed version strings and tuples, conditional type hint imports.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, auto-generated code with standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static module for version info, with conditional type hints for static analysis. It contains no external inputs, dynamic code, network activity, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, with high confidence. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature justify the low risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version info snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
