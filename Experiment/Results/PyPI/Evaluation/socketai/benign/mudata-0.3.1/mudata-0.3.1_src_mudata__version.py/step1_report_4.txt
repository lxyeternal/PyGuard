{
  "purpose": "This code is used for version management, generated by setuptools_scm, to define package version information.",
  "sources": "The version string assigned to __version__ and version variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or external outputs that could leak or cause harm.",
  "flows": "The version string is assigned to variables, with no external input or data flow that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "The code is mostly boilerplate for versioning with conditional type checking; no suspicious code, secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version variables for a package, using a conditional for type hints. It assigns a static version string ('0.3.1') to multiple variables. No input, external data, or external calls are present. The structure is straightforward and standard for version management, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard auto-generated version management code snippet with no malicious intent or security issues.",
