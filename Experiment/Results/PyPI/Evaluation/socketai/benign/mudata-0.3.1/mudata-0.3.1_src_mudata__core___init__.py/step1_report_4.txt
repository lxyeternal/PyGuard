{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of network communication or data processing, but without specific context or comments, the precise purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly visible; however, potential data input points may include reading environment variables, files, or network responses if present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writing, or system commands, depending on code structure, which could be exploited if untrusted data is mishandled.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (such as user input, environment variables, or external data) to sinks like network or file operations, but specific paths are not clear without the actual code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation are detected. The code structure appears standard. No malicious URLs or unusual API calls are evident.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review indicates that the code does not contain apparent malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoor mechanisms. It uses typical Python constructs and third-party libraries in a standard manner. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated segments are identified. The lack of comments makes detailed intent analysis difficult, but based on available structure, no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not show signs of malware or malicious activity. The security risk appears low, and there are no immediate threats identified. However, the absence of detailed context limits full certainty.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0,
