  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, environment variables, network connections, data processing routines.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file write operations, environment variable access, data output functions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as data inputs or environment variables to sinks like network or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, minimal or incomplete code, lack of suspicious patterns, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate either no code or benign code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the descriptions. Confidence levels are appropriate, being high where code is present and low where code is absent or incomplete. No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities is identified across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The scoring and reasoning are consistent and appropriate given the evidence. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
