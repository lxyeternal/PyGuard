  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python module intended for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit purpose indicated in the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, file inputs, and potentially network requests or user inputs if present (none explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be system commands, network communications, or file writes if present, but no such actions are evident in the snippet.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are identifiable in the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are observed. The code uses standard Python libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, focusing on data processing with safe use of variables and functions. No malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are apparent. It does not perform network operations, system modifications, or sensitive data handling. The absence of external inputs, network communications, or insecure operations indicates a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no evident security threats or malicious activities.",
