{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package for handling multimodal datasets, including version detection, importing necessary modules, and defining public API.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules, especially get_version from setuptools_scm, and internal package modules such as _core and _version.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data outputs or external communications detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; code primarily imports modules and defines variables.",
  "anomalies": "Standard version detection pattern with fallback imports; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The only notable behavior is dynamic version import, which is common in packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to dynamically determine the package version using setuptools_scm. If unavailable, it falls back to a local _version module. It imports core functionalities and sets up the module's public API. All operations are typical for a Python package's __init__.py, with no indication of malicious activity or suspicious behavior. No external communications, data leaks, or obfuscated code are present. The code structure and logic are straightforward and align with standard package initialization procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package initializer with version handling and imports. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It is safe based on the provided content.",
