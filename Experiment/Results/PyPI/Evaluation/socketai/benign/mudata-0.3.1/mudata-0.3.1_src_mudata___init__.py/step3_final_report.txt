{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package for handling multimodal datasets, setting up version detection, module imports, and public API exposure.",
  "sources": "Version detection via setuptools_scm, fallback to local version module, imports of core classes and functions from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Version detection source (setuptools_scm or local module) to module initialization; import statements from internal modules to package namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: dynamic version detection with a fallback, importing core dataset handling modules, and defining __all__ for API exposure. It does not execute any untrusted code, connect to networks, or process untrusted input. All import statements are from trusted packages or internal modules. The version detection pattern is common and safe. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code structure is straightforward and aligns with best practices for Python package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate a safe and well-structured setup file.",
