  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the consistency of the scores, and whether any issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard package setup, version detection, and import statements. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes the typical pattern of version retrieval with `setuptools_scm`, fallback to local version, and straightforward imports.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — all appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no issues detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirming standard package initialization, version detection, and imports. No suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is typical and safe.\n- **Scores:** All zero, matching the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard version handling and imports, with no anomalies.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** All zero, as expected.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to prior analyses, standard package setup.\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard package initialization, versioning, and imports.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is typical package setup code, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, since no security risks are evident.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware, Obfuscated, Risk Scores:** All should remain at **0**.\n- **Justification:** The code performs version detection and module imports in a standard manner, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis aligns with the comprehensive review and the analysis of all reports.",
