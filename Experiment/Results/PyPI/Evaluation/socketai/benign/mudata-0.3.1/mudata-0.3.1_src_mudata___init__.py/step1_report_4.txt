{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package for handling multimodal datasets, providing functions for reading, writing, and processing data formats like AnnData and MuData.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external modules (setuptools_scm, anndata), and internal modules (_core, _core.config, _core.io, _core.merge, _core.mudata, _core.to_)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code mainly imports modules and defines metadata and exports.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code does not process untrusted input or data flows; it primarily sets up imports and package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package versioning, module imports, and exposes public API components. The use of try-except for version retrieval is standard practice. No untrusted data handling, external network calls, or sensitive operations are observed. All imports are from legitimate, well-known packages or internal modules. The structure and format are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script for a Python library focused on dataset handling. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
