{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a Python package initialization and import module for handling multimodal datasets, specifically using AnnData and MuData objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information using 'setuptools_scm.get_version' and conditional imports for '__version__', as well as importing various modules and functions from internal package files (_core, _core.io, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present, but the imported functions like 'read', 'write', etc., could potentially handle untrusted data if used improperly elsewhere; within this file, no direct untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing version info and internal modules to defining export variables (__all__) without processing external input data or executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; the code is straightforward package setup code with no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version detection using setuptools_scm, with fallback import for __version__. It imports core functionalities and data handling functions related to AnnData and MuData. It then declares __all__ for package exports. There are no sources of untrusted input, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs. The overall structure aligns with typical package __init__.py files. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script for a Python library dealing with multimodal datasets. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no security risks. It appears safe and purpose-driven, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
