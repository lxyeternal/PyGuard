{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package for handling multimodal datasets, providing versioning, importing core functions and classes, and defining the module's public API.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'setuptools_scm', local version files, and core modules such as 'anndata', as well as the module's own version variables.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include the dynamic version retrieval and the import statements, but they are standard for package setup and initialization.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves version info from external package 'setuptools_scm' or local files, then imports various functions and classes into the package namespace, exposing them via '__all__'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or dynamic execution methods are present. The version retrieval is standard practice. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a try-except block to obtain package version info dynamically via 'setuptools_scm', falling back to local version files if needed, which is typical. It then imports core classes and functions from related modules, exposing them in '__all__'. All imports and assignments are straightforward, standard package initialization code. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code does not perform any network operations, execute untrusted data, or access sensitive system features.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard package setup and module initialization code, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It follows common patterns for Python package versioning and imports.",
