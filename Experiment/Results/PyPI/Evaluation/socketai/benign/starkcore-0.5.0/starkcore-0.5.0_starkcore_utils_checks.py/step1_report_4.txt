{
  "purpose": "Provides validation functions for environment, private key, user, language, date/time, and timedelta inputs in a cryptographic and API context.",
  "sources": "Imports from ellipticcurve and datetime modules; the check functions read inputs such as PEM strings, environment names, user identifiers, language codes, and date/time strings.",
  "sinks": "Assertion errors, exceptions, and data parsing functions that process input data; no untrusted data is written or transmitted over the network in this code.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., PEM, environment name, user, language, date/time strings) flows through validation and parsing functions; no external sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses broad exception handling (e.g., in check_private_key and check_datetime_string), which may hide underlying issues but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code does not perform any network operations, file modifications, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation for various parameters critical for cryptographic and API operations. It imports cryptographic libraries but uses them solely for validation purposes. The broad exception handling in key validation and datetime parsing could obscure errors but do not facilitate malicious behavior. There are no suspicious data flows, network activity, or manipulation of system resources. Overall, the code appears to be a set of utility validation functions with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard validation utility for cryptographic and date/time inputs, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. Its broad exception handling warrants caution but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, it is safe based on the provided code.",
