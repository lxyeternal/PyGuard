  "purpose": "Utility functions for validating environment, private keys, user input, language, and date/time data.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to validation functions: environment, pem (private key), user, language, date/time data.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and exceptions that could halt execution if input validation fails; no data leaks or insecure sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into validation functions, which either return validated data or raise exceptions. No untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The only assertions are for validation; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. No misuse of environment variables or data leakage points detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward validation of input parameters such as environment, private key PEM format, user presence, language, and date/time data. It uses assertions and exception handling to enforce validity. The functions handle various date/time formats and conversions safely. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. No network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The code appears to be well-structured, standard validation logic, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The use of 'assert' statements and exception raising is appropriate for validation and does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of validation utility functions with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It performs standard input validation and data conversion safely. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
