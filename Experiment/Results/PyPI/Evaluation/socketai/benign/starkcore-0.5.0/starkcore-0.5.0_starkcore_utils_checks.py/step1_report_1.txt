{
  "purpose": "The code provides validation and utility functions for environment settings, private keys, user input, language preferences, and date/time processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as environment, pem, user, language, data, and timedelta.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write or execute untrusted data in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated and converted through various functions without any external network or file operations, and no untrusted data is used in dangerous contexts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Use of assertions and exception handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of validation functions that check inputs for correctness, such as environment validation, private key format, user existence, language support, and date/time parsing. The use of assertions and try-except blocks is typical for validation routines. No external network operations, file writes, or untrusted command executions are present. The code does not include any suspicious or malicious logic, nor does it manipulate data in a harmful way. It appears to be straightforward validation code intended to ensure correct input formats and values.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard validation utility module with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any external communications, data leaks, or harmful operations. It is safe and aligns with typical input validation patterns.",
