  "purpose": "Utility functions for environment validation, key validation, user verification, language checks, and datetime parsing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: environment, pem, user, language, data, and data strings.",
  "sinks": "Assertions, exception raising, and internal function calls; no data sinks or external data effects are observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and transformed; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. The code relies on assertions and exception handling for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation routines: environment verification, PEM key validation, user presence check, language enforcement, and date/time parsing. The PrivateKey import and validation uses a well-known library and only checks the curve name. No external data is transmitted, and no code injections or backdoors are evident. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. Exception handling is straightforward, with no signs of malicious obfuscation or data leaks. The code appears safe and adheres to expected validation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility validation functions with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs typical input validation and parsing tasks without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
