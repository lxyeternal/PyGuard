  "purpose": "Validation functions for environment, cryptographic keys, user input, language, and date/time data to ensure correctness and integrity.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as environment name, PEM string, user object, language string, date/datetime objects, timedelta values, and datetime strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data leaks; primarily validation checks with no data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into validation functions, which assert or parse data, returning validated or transformed data; no external or unsafe data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling in 'check_private_key' and 'check_datetime_string' could obscure errors; relative import from '..environment' might be unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward validation of environment, cryptographic keys, user info, language, and date/time data. No external network, file, or system command execution occurs. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. Exception handling is broad but standard for validation routines. The cryptographic check only verifies the curve name, not key material. The relative import is context-dependent but not inherently malicious. No suspicious patterns or malicious code are detected. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects the benign nature of the code, with minor concerns about exception handling but no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard validation utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores in the reports are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall security risk is very low, and the code does not pose any threat in its current form.",
