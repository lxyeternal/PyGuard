  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform secure HTTP requests to a specified API, including authentication, URL construction, and error handling.",
  "sources": "User input via payload, query parameters, user object (access_id, private_key), environment settings, and method call parameters.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request sending via method(), response handling, and logging. Potential data leaks if responses contain sensitive info, especially in error handling.",
  "flows": "User data (access_id, private_key) flows into _authentication_headers() for signing. Payload and query data flow into URL and headers. Response data flows back to the caller, with possible error propagation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of time-based signatures could be a privacy concern if logs are stored insecurely. No explicit hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The Ecdsa signing function could be exploited if the private key is compromised, but that depends on external key management.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs API URLs based on environment and host, ensuring correct URL formation. User authentication is performed via ECDSA signatures, which is a secure method if private keys are kept safe. Exception handling captures general exceptions and encapsulates them in a Response object, avoiding crashes. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious data leaks, or malicious commands. No suspicious network behavior beyond typical API request/response cycle. The signing process uses a time-based nonce (access_time), which is standard. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present; secrets are passed via user objects. Overall, the code appears to follow good security practices for API communication, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. Low likelihood of malicious intent.",
