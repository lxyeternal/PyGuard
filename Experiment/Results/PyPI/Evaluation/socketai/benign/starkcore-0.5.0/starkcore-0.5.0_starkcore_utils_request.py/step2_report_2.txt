  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code constructs URLs dynamically based on environment and host.\n- It signs requests with ECDSA using user's private key, incorporating a timestamp and request body.\n- Error handling is standard, raising specific exceptions for certain HTTP status codes.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious data are evident.\n- The use of system time in signatures is typical for nonce purposes.\n- The cryptographic library appears standard; no malicious patterns are visible.\n- No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as an SDK for API requests, with user input and environment variables as sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly describes network request and response flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and legitimate signature process.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious behavior, consistent with a secure SDK.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.  \n**Score suggestion:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, correctly identifies data sources.\n- **Potential concern:** Highlights the use of `time()` in signature, which is standard for nonce, and notes no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent, just standard request signing.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Well reasoned.  \n**Score suggestion:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes typical API client behavior.\n- **Potential concern:** Again mentions `time()` usage, which is normal.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, no backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.  \n**Score suggestion:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the flow.\n- **Potential concern:** Mentions use of cryptographic signing with user private keys, which is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.  \n**Score suggestion:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the data flow.\n- **Potential concern:** Highlights the use of time-based signatures, which could be a privacy concern if logs are insecure, but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, proper request signing.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0 (0.1-0.2), reflecting standard API client risks, which is reasonable.\n\n**Note on risk scores:** Given the code performs cryptographic signing and URL construction securely, and no malicious patterns are detected, the risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My final expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** — standard SDK risk, acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and cautious. The code appears to be a well-implemented, secure API client SDK with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores are justified and should remain as they are.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe based on the provided analysis.",
