  "purpose": "This code implements a secure API request client with cryptographic signing, URL construction based on environment and host, and error handling.",
  "sources": "User data (user object), environment variables, system time, input payload, query parameters",
  "sinks": "Network request via method(), response handling, cryptographic signing with private key",
  "flows": "Source (user data, payload, environment) -> URL construction -> request signing -> network request -> response handling",
  "anomalies": "Use of system time in signatures (standard nonce), no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code constructs URLs dynamically based on environment and host, signs requests with ECDSA using the user's private key incorporating a timestamp, and handles errors with specific exceptions. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The use of current time in signatures is typical for nonce generation. No malicious network activity or data leaks are evident. The cryptographic process appears standard and correctly implemented. The overall structure and behavior align with legitimate SDK practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK for secure API communication. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain compromise are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to standard cryptographic practices and timestamp usage. The code is safe and suitable for use.",
