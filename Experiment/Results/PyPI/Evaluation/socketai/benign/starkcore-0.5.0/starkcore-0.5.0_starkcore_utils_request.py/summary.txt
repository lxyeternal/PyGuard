  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK for secure API communication. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain compromise are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to standard cryptographic practices and timestamp usage. The code is safe and suitable for use."
