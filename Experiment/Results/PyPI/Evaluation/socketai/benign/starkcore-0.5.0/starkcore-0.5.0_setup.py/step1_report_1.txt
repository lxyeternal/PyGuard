  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'starkcore' Python package, including reading version info and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'starkcore/__init__.py' files; extracting version information using regex.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data is being written to external systems or executed dynamically.",
  "flows": "File reads (sources) do not lead to any data leaks or malicious actions, as they are standard setup operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs typical package setup tasks without unusual code structures or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules for regex and package setup. It reads a README file and extracts version info from the package's __init__.py. The setup() function specifies package metadata and dependencies. All operations are typical for a Python package's setup script, with no suspicious code or behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The regex used for version extraction is straightforward and safe. There are no indications of obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
