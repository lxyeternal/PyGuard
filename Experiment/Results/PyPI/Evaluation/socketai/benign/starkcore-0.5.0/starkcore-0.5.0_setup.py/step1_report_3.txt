{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'starkcore' Python package, handling package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading 'starkcore/__init__.py' to extract version number.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or inputs are processed into vulnerable sinks.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> extracting version -> passing metadata to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to extract version is common; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file and extracts version info from an init file using regex. It then calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata and dependencies. There are no external inputs from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious behavior. The dependencies listed are standard and open-source. The code structure and content appear typical for a Python package setup, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions solely to package and distribute the Python module securely.",
