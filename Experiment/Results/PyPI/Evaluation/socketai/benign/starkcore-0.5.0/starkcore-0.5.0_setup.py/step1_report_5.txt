{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'starkcore' Python package, handling package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'starkcore/__init__.py' files to extract package description and version.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is directly used in sensitive operations like system calls or network requests.",
  "flows": "Read files to extract version info; package installation with specified dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The code performs standard setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files ('README.md' and '__init__.py') to gather package information. It uses regex to extract the version string, which is a common and safe practice. Dependencies are specified explicitly. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or credential handling is present. The overall structure aligns with typical Python package setup scripts, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup script for a Python package. It does not contain malicious code or behaviors and follows typical conventions for package configuration.",
