  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'starkcore', used for packaging and distribution of the SDK.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description and 'starkcore/__init__.py' for version information.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data; no data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from '__init__.py' and includes it in package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard practices for package setup, including reading external files for metadata and specifying dependencies. The version extraction via regex appears safe and straightforward. No dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscated patterns are present. The dependencies listed are well-known packages. Overall, the code is a typical setup script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this module.",
