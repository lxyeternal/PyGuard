  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'starkcore', handling metadata, version extraction, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for description; extracting version from 'starkcore/__init__.py' via regex.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data handling that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "File reads for README and version extraction; no dynamic or network data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and follows common setup patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input. The regex for version extraction is simple and safe. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets are present. All dependencies are standard. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No errors or flaws are identified in the analysis. The code poses no security risks and is standard for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
