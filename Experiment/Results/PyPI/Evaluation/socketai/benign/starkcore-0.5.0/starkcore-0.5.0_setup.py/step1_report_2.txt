  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'starkcore' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file and 'starkcore/__init__.py' to extract version information.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is used directly in dangerous contexts.",
  "flows": "Reading files to obtain package description and version, then passing data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. Version extraction uses regex, but it's a standard pattern.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the README.md for package description and the __init__.py file to extract the version via regex. The setup() function is called with static metadata and dependencies. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code performs standard package setup tasks, and dependencies are specified explicitly with version constraints.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply configures the package metadata and dependencies.",
