  "purpose": "Provides enum-like behavior by listing class attributes and validating membership.",
  "sources": "Class attributes accessed via dir() and getattr()",
  "sinks": "Membership check in is_valid()",
  "flows": "values() retrieves attribute names; is_valid() checks if item is in this list",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and uses standard reflection",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility class Enum with methods to list attribute names and validate membership. It uses dir() and getattr() for reflection, which is safe and common. No external input, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The implementation is simple, with no signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for enum-like behavior with no security risks or malicious activity. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
