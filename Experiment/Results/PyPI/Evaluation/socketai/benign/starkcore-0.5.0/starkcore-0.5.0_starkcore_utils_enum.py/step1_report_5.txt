{
  "purpose": "Define a simple Enum-like class with methods to list valid values and check validity.",
  "sources": "Class attributes accessed via dir() and getattr() for validation.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data is sent to external systems or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; methods only operate on class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The class provides methods to list non-callable, non-private attributes and validate if a given item is among those attributes. It relies on dir() and getattr(), which are standard reflection methods in Python. There is no dynamic code execution, external network interaction, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of an Enum utility class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for handling enumeration-like behavior with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
