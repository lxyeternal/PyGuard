{
  "purpose": "Defines a simple Enum class with methods to list its values and validate if an item is a valid member.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code reads class attributes via dir(cls).",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any actions that could leak data.",
  "flows": "N/A; there are no source-to-sink data flows or external data manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic execution, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The class provides two class methods: 'values' which returns non-callable, non-private attributes of the class, and 'is_valid' which checks if a given item is among these values. The implementation is straightforward and typical for an enum-like pattern in Python. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. The code does not interact with external inputs, files, network, or environment variables, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of an Enum-like class with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
