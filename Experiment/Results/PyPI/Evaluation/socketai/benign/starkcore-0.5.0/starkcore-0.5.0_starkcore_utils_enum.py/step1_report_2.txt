{
  "purpose": "Defines a simple Enum-like class with methods to list valid values and check validity.",
  "sources": "The class attributes and method parameters (e.g., 'item')",
  "sinks": "Potential use of 'item' in validation or logic (no explicit sinks present)",
  "flows": "Input 'item' is checked against the list of class attributes",
  "anomalies": "None apparent; code uses standard class and method structures with no hidden or obfuscated parts",
  "analysis": "The class 'Enum' provides class methods to list all non-callable, non-private class attributes, which are intended to serve as enum values. The 'values' method returns a list of attribute names, while 'is_valid' checks if a given item is among those values. The code is straightforward and uses typical Python patterns for mimicking enum behavior. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code injection. The class does not read untrusted input directly nor performs any network or file operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for enum-like behavior with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions as a simple validator for class attribute values.",
