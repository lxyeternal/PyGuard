  "purpose": "Define a simple Enum-like class with methods to list values and validate membership",
  "sources": "Class attributes accessed via dir() and getattr()",
  "sinks": "None present; no data leaks or external interactions",
  "flows": "Class attribute definitions serve as sources; validation method checks membership",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class Enum with class methods 'values' and 'is_valid'. 'values' returns a list of non-callable, non-private attributes of the class, effectively simulating enum values. 'is_valid' checks if a given item exists in these values. The implementation is straightforward, relying on standard Python class and reflection features. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no external network interactions, no obfuscation, and no unusual code constructs. The code appears to be a basic utility class for enum-like behavior with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing enumeration values. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a standard pattern for enum-like classes in Python.",
