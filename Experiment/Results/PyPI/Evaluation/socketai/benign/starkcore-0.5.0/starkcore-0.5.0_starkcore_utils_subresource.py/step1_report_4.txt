{
  "purpose": "The class SubResource appears to provide a string representation of its instances, likely for debugging or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads instance attributes using dir(self) and getattr(self, attribute).",
  "sinks": "The code does not interact with untrusted data sources, network operations, or external inputs. It only accesses object attributes.",
  "flows": "There are no external data flows from sources to sinks, as the code solely generates a string from internal attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code dynamically constructs a string representation without executing external code or handling sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods for string representation. It iterates over all non-callable, non-private attributes, creating a formatted string that lists attribute names and their values. No external inputs, network operations, or security-sensitive code is involved. The code does not appear obfuscated, malicious, or to contain any backdoors. It serves a benign purpose of representing object state.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an object string representation method with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
