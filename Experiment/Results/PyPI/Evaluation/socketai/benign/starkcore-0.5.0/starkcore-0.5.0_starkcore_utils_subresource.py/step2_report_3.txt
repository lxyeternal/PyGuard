  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, focusing on the core code and the assessments provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The class `SubResource` defines two methods:\n  - `__repr__`: returns the class name.\n  - `__str__`: dynamically constructs a string representation of the object by iterating over all attributes returned by `dir(self)`, filtering out private and callable attributes, then formatting their names and values into a multi-line string.\n\n**Security assessment:**\n- The code does not perform any external network activity, file I/O, or execute untrusted code.\n- It only reads object attributes and formats them for display.\n- Using `dir()` and `getattr()` is standard for introspection and debugging purposes.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The dynamic attribute listing could, in theory, include sensitive data if present, but this is typical for debugging code and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Review of the reports:**\n- All reports concur that the code is benign, intended for debugging or display.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or security risks are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), and malware scores are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Scores and justifications:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity or code execution.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, using standard Python features.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no external data handling or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Any adjustments?**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- Given that the code could expose sensitive attributes if present, but this is typical for debugging classes, the risk remains low.\n- No reason to increase the scores.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a harmless utility class for object representation.\n- The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, straightforward, and serves a debugging purpose. There are no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- Confirmed: No malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- Justification: The code is a standard, benign implementation for object string representation with no external dependencies or malicious patterns.",
