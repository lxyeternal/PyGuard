{
  "purpose": "Provides a string representation of an object by introspecting its attributes for debugging or display purposes.",
  "sources": "Attributes of the object obtained via dir(self), filtered to exclude private and callable attributes.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle external data, perform network operations, or write to external systems.",
  "flows": "Attributes retrieved from dir(self) are formatted into a string; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses standard Python introspection methods.",
  "analysis": "The class SubResource defines __repr__ returning the class name and __str__ constructing a multi-line string of attribute names and values. It filters attributes to exclude private and callable ones, then formats them. No external input, network activity, or malicious code is involved. The use of dir() and getattr() is typical for debugging utilities. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The code is safe, simple, and intended for object display, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for object string representation. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
