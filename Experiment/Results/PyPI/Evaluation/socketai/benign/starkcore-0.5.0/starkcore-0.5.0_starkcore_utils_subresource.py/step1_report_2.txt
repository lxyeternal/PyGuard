  "purpose": "Define a class SubResource with customized string representations for debugging or display purposes.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; relies solely on object attributes for __str__ and __repr__ methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no data outputs, network communication, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; methods only access object attributes and format output.",
  "anomalies": "The __str__ method dynamically accesses all non-callable, non-private attributes, which could potentially include sensitive data if present.",
  "analysis": "The class SubResource provides __repr__ and __str__ methods for representing objects as strings. The __str__ method constructs a string from all non-private, non-callable attributes, formatting multi-line attribute values. There are no external data inputs, network communications, or execution of arbitrary code. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage indicators are present. The dynamic attribute listing is typical for debugging purposes and does not inherently pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign class definition intended for object representation, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
