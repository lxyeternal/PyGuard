{
  "purpose": "Define a class SubResource with custom string representations (__repr__ and __str__) for debugging or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads attribute names and values from the class instance via dir(self) and getattr(self, attribute).",
  "sinks": "Uses string formatting to construct a detailed string representation of the object; no external data sinks or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Attributes are read from the instance; values are converted to strings and formatted for output.",
  "anomalies": "None evident. The code dynamically generates string representations based on the object's attributes. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with __repr__ and __str__ methods to display object information. __str__ gathers all non-callable, non-private attributes and formats them into a multi-line string. The implementation is straightforward and uses standard Python features. No external inputs, network operations, or potentially malicious constructs are present. The code's purpose appears to be purely for debugging or logging. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign implementation of custom string representations for a class. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It solely focuses on presenting object attributes in a readable format.",
