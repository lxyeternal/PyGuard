{
  "purpose": "The class SubResource appears to be a utility class for representing objects with a string and representation method, likely used for debugging or display purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads object attributes via dir(self) and getattr(self, attribute).",
  "sinks": "The code converts attribute values to strings for display, but does not write or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Attributes are accessed via getattr within __str__, then formatted into a string representation.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No dynamic code execution or external communications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with __repr__ and __str__ methods. __repr__ returns the class name. __str__ gathers all non-callable, non-private attributes and formats them into a readable string. It uses dir(self) and getattr to dynamically access attributes. The method joins attribute key-value pairs into a multi-line string for display purposes. No external data sources, no unsafe code, no obfuscated or malicious constructs are present. The code appears solely for debugging or logging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless utility for representing object attributes as strings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
