{
  "purpose": "The class SubResource appears to be a utility for representing objects with custom string and representation methods, likely for debugging or display purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads attribute data from the object instance using getattr and dir within the __str__ method.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, network, or handle untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Attributes obtained via getattr are used to generate a formatted string; no external data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The use of dir(self) combined with getattr can lead to including non-relevant or special attributes, but not maliciously. The code does not execute any external code, nor does it handle input from untrusted sources.",
  "analysis": "The class defines __repr__ and __str__ methods for object representation. The __repr__ method simply returns the class name. The __str__ method constructs a dictionary of the object's attributes, excluding private and callable attributes, then formats them into a string with class name and attributes. The use of dir() and getattr() is standard for such introspective purposes. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward and safe, with no external dependencies or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless utility class for representing object state as a string. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
