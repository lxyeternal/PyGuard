  "purpose": "Import the 'cache' module or object from the local package for caching purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local package's cache module or object.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; this code only performs an import operation.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'cache' into the current namespace, with no data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports 'cache' from a relative module, which is a common practice in Python packages. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activities. The minimal nature of the code provides limited scope for malicious intent, and the import appears standard.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and typical of modular Python applications.",
