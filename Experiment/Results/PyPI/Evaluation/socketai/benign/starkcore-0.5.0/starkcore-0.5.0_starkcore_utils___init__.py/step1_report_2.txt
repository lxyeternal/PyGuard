  "purpose": "Import the 'cache' object or module from a local package or module named 'cache'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a relative import statement '.cache', which sources data from the local module or package named 'cache'.",
  "sinks": "This code itself does not contain any sinks; it only imports a module or object.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the local 'cache' module into the current namespace via the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are evident in this single line; it is a standard import statement. Without additional context, no unusual behavior or secrets are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward relative import of 'cache', likely a local module or object within the same package. There is no evident malicious behavior, backdoor, or suspicious activity here. It is a common pattern in Python projects to modularize code. No data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious intent are apparent from this line alone. As this is only a single line, it provides limited context, but based solely on this, there are no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple relative import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign part of a Python project’s structure.",
