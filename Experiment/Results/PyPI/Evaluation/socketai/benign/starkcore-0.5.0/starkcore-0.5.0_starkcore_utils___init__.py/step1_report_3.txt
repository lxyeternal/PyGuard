{
  "purpose": "The code imports a 'cache' component from a relative module named 'cache', likely for caching data within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module 'cache' within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no untrusted data processing or output occurs here.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows in this single-line code snippet; it simply imports a module component.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "This code is a straightforward import statement using relative import syntax to bring 'cache' into the current namespace. It does not contain any dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. Given the limited context, it appears to be standard package import code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is typical for Python projects to structure imports this way.",
