  "purpose": "Importing a local 'cache' module in a Python package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which reads the '.cache' module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects; the import is a static code operation with no data sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is a simple import without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import statement in Python, commonly used in package structures. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The import does not involve dynamic execution, external data, or potentially dangerous patterns. The minimal context supports a benign assessment. The scores across reports are consistent with this conclusion, with minor overestimations of security risk in some cases, which should be adjusted to zero for accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard Python import syntax with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The overall assessment confirms no security concerns.",
