  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a simple import statement; no issues detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The confidence is 0.8, which is reasonable given the minimal context.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation. The low confidence reflects some uncertainty due to lack of context, which is appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; a straightforward import.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The confidence is 1, which is justified given the simplicity.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior. The report's conclusion is accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Again, a simple import statement.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. The confidence is 1.\n- **Discussion on securityRisk score:** The score of 0.1 suggests a very low risk, but given the code is just an import, this seems overly cautious. Unless there is some context indicating that the 'cache' module could be malicious, this score should be 0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or suspicious behavior is evident. The minimal code doesn't justify a security risk score above 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as previous; a simple import.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The confidence is 1.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The confidence is 1.\n- **Justification:** No issues identified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent.\n- The only point of contention is Report 3's securityRisk score of 0.1. Given the minimal code and lack of suspicious behavior, this should be adjusted to 0.\n\n### Malware and Obfuscated Scores:\n- All reports have malware=0 and obfuscated=0, which is consistent with the code.\n- The risk scores are all 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk based on the provided code)\n\n**Note:** Without additional context or code, these import statements are benign. The scores should reflect the absence of malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- The current scores are appropriate, except for Report 3's securityRisk, which should be adjusted from 0.1 to 0.\n- The overall malware and obfuscated scores remain at 0.\n- The confidence levels are justified given the minimal code.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Set all malware and obfuscated scores to 0.\n- Set all securityRisk scores to 0, including Report 3.\n- Maintain confidence levels as they are, given the limited context.\n\nThis ensures consistency and accuracy in the assessment.",
