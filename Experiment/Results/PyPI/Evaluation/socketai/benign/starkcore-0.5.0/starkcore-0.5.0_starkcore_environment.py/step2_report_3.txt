  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code imports an Enum class from `starkcore.utils.enum` and defines an `Environment` enum with two string values: `'sandbox'` and `'production'`.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no data input/output, no external interactions, and no complex logic.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, simple, and typical for environment configuration.\n   - No report claims the code contains obfuscated, malicious, or vulnerable constructs, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code only defines constants; there are no dynamic elements, external data handling, or network interactions.\n   - No signs of malicious intent, such as code injection, secret exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n   - The import from `starkcore.utils.enum` is presumed to be a legitimate Enum class, though its origin (third-party or internal) isn't specified. This does not impact security unless the library itself is compromised, which is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly concluding that the code is benign.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- While the code is safe, if `starkcore.utils.enum` is a third-party library, one might consider verifying its integrity, but this is outside the scope of this snippet.\n- The code serves as a simple configuration enum, common in many codebases.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. No changes are necessary. The code poses no security threat, and the scores reflect that accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign and straightforward nature.",
