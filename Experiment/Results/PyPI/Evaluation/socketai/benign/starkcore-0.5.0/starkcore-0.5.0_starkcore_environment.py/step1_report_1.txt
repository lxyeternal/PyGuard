{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class 'Environment' with two possible values: 'sandbox' and 'production'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'starkcore.utils.enum', which may be a third-party library or internal module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs present in the code.",
  "flows": "Import flow from external module to local class definition; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The class simply defines constants.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an Enum class, then defines a subclass 'Environment' with two string attributes. There are no inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The structure is straightforward and typical for enum definitions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple enumeration definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of a larger codebase for environment configuration.",
