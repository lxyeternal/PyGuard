  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class for different environment types (sandbox and production).",
  "sources": "Import statement from starkcore.utils.enum, class attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; code only defines an enum class with string values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an Enum class from a third-party module and defines an Environment class with two string attributes. There are no user inputs, data outputs, or external network interactions. The code appears straightforward and typical for defining environment states. No obfuscated code, malicious constructs, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple enum definition with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is a standard pattern for managing environment configurations.",
