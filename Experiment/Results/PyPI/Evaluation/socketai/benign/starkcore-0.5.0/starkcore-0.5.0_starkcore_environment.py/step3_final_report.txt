  "purpose": "Defines an Environment enum with 'sandbox' and 'production' string values for configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Import from 'starkcore.utils.enum' and enum class definition; no external data input or output.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static enum declaration with no dynamic data or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward enum class with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an Enum class and defines a simple enum with two string members. It contains no external data handling, no dynamic behavior, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence (1), and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The import source is presumed trustworthy; no vulnerabilities or malicious activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard enum definition with no security issues or malicious behavior. The reports and scores are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
