  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different environment modes (sandbox and production).",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leakage points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths, as there are no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward, defining a simple enum class with string values. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an Enum class from an external module, likely used to specify environment modes. It defines a class Environment with two members: 'sandbox' and 'production'. The structure is standard and does not include any dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. It is a typical pattern for environment configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign enumeration definition for environment modes with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
