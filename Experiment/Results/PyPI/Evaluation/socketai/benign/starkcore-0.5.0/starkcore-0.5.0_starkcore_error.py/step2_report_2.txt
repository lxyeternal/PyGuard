  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n**1. Code Review:**\n\n- The code defines custom exception classes, all inheriting from `StarkError`.\n- The `Error` class initializes with a `code` and `message`, and calls `super(Exception, self).__init__()` with a formatted string.\n- The `InputErrors` class takes a list of errors and creates `Error` instances for each, then calls `super(Exception, self).__init__()` with the string representation of the content.\n- The other error classes (`InternalServerError`, `UnknownError`, `InvalidSignatureError`) are straightforward.\n\n**Potential issues in the code:**\n\n- **Incorrect use of `super()` in exception classes:**\n  - In Python 3, the correct way to call the superclass `__init__` is `super().__init__()`.\n  - The code uses `super(Exception, self).__init__()`, which is incorrect. This syntax is valid in Python 2 for specifying a different class in the method resolution order, but here it seems misused.\n  - This mistake could prevent proper exception message setting and cause issues when catching exceptions.\n\n- **Impact of the mistake:**\n  - Exceptions may not carry the intended message or may not behave as expected.\n  - If these exceptions are raised and caught, the error messages may be missing or malformed.\n\n**2. Do the reported issues reflect a security concern?**\n\n- The reports only indicate \"Empty response\" errors with no raw response data.\n- No indication of malicious activity, payload, or code execution.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malware in the code snippets or reports.\n\n**3. Malware and obfuscation scores:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity or payload detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's exception class issues, the risk is mainly related to robustness and correctness, not security.\n\n**4. Logical flaws and reasoning:**\n\n- The main flaw is the incorrect use of `super()`, which could lead to exceptions not functioning correctly.\n- The report's focus on \"Empty response\" errors does not indicate security issues but rather application logic or network problems.\n\n**5. Are the scores assigned reasonable?**\n\n- If the report assigned high malware or risk scores, that would be unreasonable.\n- Given the evidence, all scores should be low, with a possible minor risk due to coding mistakes.\n\n**6. Final assessment:**\n\n- **Code issues:** Yes, the incorrect `super()` usage is a bug.\n- **Malware:** No.\n- **Obfuscation:** No.\n- **Risk:** Low, but with potential for runtime errors if exceptions are raised.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of recommendations:\n\n- **Correct the `super()` calls** to `super().__init__()` in all exception classes.\n- **Adjust scores:**\n  - Malware score: 0\n  - Obfuscated score: 0\n  - Risk score: around 0.2 (due to code correctness issues, but not security-related)\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\n\nThe main concern here is a coding bug, not a security vulnerability. The exception handling might not work as intended, but there's no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
