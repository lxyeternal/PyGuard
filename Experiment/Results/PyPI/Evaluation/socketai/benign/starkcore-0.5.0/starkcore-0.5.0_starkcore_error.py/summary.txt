  "conclusion": "The code contains a significant bug in exception superclass calls, which can impair error handling and stability but does not directly indicate malicious activity. The 'Empty response' reports are operational, not security-related. Correcting super() usage is recommended; overall security risk remains low, but robustness is compromised."
