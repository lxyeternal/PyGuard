  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes inheriting from StarkError for error handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in constructors, such as error content and messages.",
  "sinks": "Exception message formatting and propagation, particularly the super().__init__() calls.",
  "flows": "Error classes receive input; improper super() calls may prevent correct exception initialization and handling.",
  "anomalies": "Incorrect use of super(Exception, self).__init__() instead of super().__init__() in multiple classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exceptions but misuses super() in constructors, which can cause improper exception behavior. Reports indicate 'Empty response' errors unrelated to the code logic, suggesting operational issues rather than security flaws. The main concern is the flawed exception hierarchy, which could lead to unhandled exceptions or masking errors, impacting stability. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, but the risk score should be elevated (~0.7) due to potential exception handling failures.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a significant bug in exception superclass calls, which can impair error handling and stability but does not directly indicate malicious activity. The 'Empty response' reports are operational, not security-related. Correcting super() usage is recommended; overall security risk remains low, but robustness is compromised.",
