  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code Review:**\n\n- The code defines several custom exceptions inheriting from `StarkError`.\n- Notably, in the constructors of `Error`, `InputErrors`, `InternalServerError`, and `UnknownError`, the calls to `super()` are made as `super(Exception, self).__init__(...)`. This is incorrect. The proper way to call the superclass constructor in Python 3 is `super().__init__(...)`.  \n- The current code's `super(Exception, self).__init__(...)` calls the `__init__` method of `Exception`'s superclass, which may not behave as intended, especially since the class inherits from `StarkError`, which in turn inherits from `Exception`. This could lead to improper exception chaining or message handling.\n- This mistake could cause the exceptions to not behave as expected, especially when caught or logged, potentially hiding errors or causing confusion during debugging.\n\n**2. Presence of Reported Issues in the Code:**\n\n- The reports only mention \"Empty response\" with an empty string as `raw_response`.  \n- The code does not process `raw_response` or handle empty responses explicitly.  \n- Therefore, the reports are not reflecting actual issues in the code but are rather external reports of an observed problem (empty responses).  \n- The code itself does not contain logic to detect or handle empty responses, so these reports are not indicative of a code flaw but perhaps of usage or network issues.\n\n**3. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n\n- The reports simply state \"Empty response\" with no further context.  \n- They do not provide details about how or where the empty response affects the system, nor do they link to specific vulnerabilities or malpractices.  \n- Without context, these reports are limited and do not point to a security flaw in the code itself but rather to an operational issue.\n\n**4. Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- Since the code does not process responses or handle empty responses explicitly, and the reports are just stating an external condition, the risk associated with these reports should be low unless empty responses are indicative of a security flaw or vulnerability.  \n- The code's mistake in calling `super()` could be considered a flaw, but it is not directly related to the reports of empty responses.  \n- The malware score should be low unless there's evidence that empty responses are being exploited maliciously, which isn't provided here.\n\n**5. Critical Evaluation:**\n\n- The main concern in the code is the incorrect use of `super()`. This is a flaw that could cause bugs but not necessarily security vulnerabilities.  \n- The reports of \"Empty response\" do not indicate malicious activity or vulnerabilities; they seem to be operational issues.  \n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or exploitation related to the empty responses.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n| Aspect                     | Evaluation                                                                                      |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Presence of issues in code | Yes, incorrect `super()` calls in exception constructors.                                      |\n| Reports' reflection in code| No, reports are about empty responses, which the code does not handle explicitly.             |\n| Malware score              | Likely very low, as no malicious activity is indicated.                                        |\n| Obfuscated score           | Not applicable; no obfuscation detected.                                                        |\n| Risk score (overall)       | Low, around 0.1-0.2, since the main flaw is a coding mistake, not a security vulnerability.   |\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- Fix the `super()` calls in exception constructors to `super().__init__(...)` for correct behavior.\n- Consider adding response validation or error handling for empty responses if they are critical.\n- No changes to malware or obfuscated scores are necessary based on the current information.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code contains a mistake in exception constructor calls but does not demonstrate security vulnerabilities based on the provided reports. The reports of empty responses are operational issues, not security concerns. The overall risk and malware scores should remain low.",
