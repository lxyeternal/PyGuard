  "purpose": "Generate a secp256k1 ECDSA private/public key pair for API authentication, optionally saving the keys as PEM files.",
  "sources": "Code reads the 'path' parameter for directory creation; uses cryptographic library to generate keys.",
  "sinks": "Writing private and public PEM files to disk if 'path' is provided.",
  "flows": "Input 'path' → Directory creation and file writing → Return key PEMs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation. Use of standard cryptographic library functions is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The function generates cryptographic key pairs using the ellipticcurve library, which appears legitimate. It checks for the existence of the provided directory path before creating it, then writes private and public keys into PEM files if a path is specified. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are present. The use of cryptography and file system access aligns with standard practices for key management. Overall, the code appears straightforward and intended solely for key generation and storage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical key generation utility without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It securely creates and optionally saves cryptographic keys. No security risks or malware indications are observed.",
