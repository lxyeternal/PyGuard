{
  "purpose": "Generate a secp256k1 ECDSA private/public key pair and optionally save them to specified directory",
  "sources": "Import of ellipticcurve.PrivateKey, reading of optional 'path' parameter, checking for directory existence",
  "sinks": "File writes to 'private-key.pem' and 'public-key.pem' in specified directory",
  "flows": "PrivateKey() creates key object -> toPem() extracts key data -> file write operations save keys if path provided",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or malicious code behaviors, no obfuscation, no unusual logic beyond standard key generation",
  "analysis": "The code generates an elliptic curve private/public key pair, which is a standard cryptographic operation. It conditionally creates directories and saves PEM-encoded keys to files. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. Usage of external library is standard, and no secrets are hardcoded. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical key generation routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for generating and optionally saving cryptographic keys. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks beyond normal operations.",
