  "purpose": "Legacy compatibility setup for Python 2, ensuring proper string encoding and importing environment and user modules.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info.major (version check), sys (reload and setdefaultencoding), imported modules (.environment, .user)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external communication, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Version check source leads to conditional reload and encoding setting; imports are straightforward and do not process untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated practices: reload(sys) and sys.setdefaultencoding('UTF8') in Python 2, which are unsafe but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code performs a Python 2 version check, and if true, reloads sys and sets default encoding to UTF8, a known legacy workaround. It defines a version string and imports modules related to environment and user management. No external data, network activity, or malicious code is present. The practices used are deprecated and unsafe but not malicious. The code is straightforward and serves as legacy support, with no obfuscated or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as legacy compatibility code for Python 2. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main concern is the use of deprecated practices, which pose maintainability issues but not security threats. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.1-0.2). The scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
