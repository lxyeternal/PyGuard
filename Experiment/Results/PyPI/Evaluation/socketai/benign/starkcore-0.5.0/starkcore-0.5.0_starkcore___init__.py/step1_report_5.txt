  "purpose": "Initialize environment settings for compatibility with Python 2 and import project modules.",
  "sources": "sys module for version information, relative imports for environment, user, organization, project, user modules.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only performs environment setup and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Python 2-specific code (reload and setdefaultencoding), which is deprecated and potentially insecure if misused, but here it appears solely for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code detects if running on Python 2 and, if so, reloads sys and sets default encoding to UTF8. This is a known compatibility pattern but can be risky if used improperly. The code then defines a version string and imports internal modules. There are no suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The use of deprecated functions is a concern but not malicious. No external data inputs, no secret handling, and no malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily ensures compatibility with Python 2 by setting the default encoding, and then imports internal modules for further use. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet, although the use of deprecated Python 2 features indicates legacy support rather than malicious intent.",
