  "purpose": "Set default encoding for Python 2 and import environment and user-related modules.",
  "sources": "sys module for version info, relative imports for environment and user modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external output detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only sets encoding and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated Python 2 encoding setting; no indication of malicious intent, but the encoding setting could affect behavior in legacy environments.",
  "analysis": "The code first checks if running under Python 2; if so, it reloads sys and sets the default string encoding to UTF-8, which is a common practice in legacy Python 2 code to avoid encoding issues. The version string is a simple hardcoded value. The code then imports some internal modules. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The use of sys.setdefaultencoding is considered insecure in modern contexts but is not inherently malicious; it's a legacy compatibility measure. No external data input, malicious payloads, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily legacy compatibility code with no malicious intent. It performs harmless operations related to setting encoding in Python 2 and imports modules. No security risks are identified beyond deprecated practices.",
