  "purpose": "Configure environment settings based on Python version and import modules related to environment and user management.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version check; import statements for environment and user modules",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no untrusted data handling or external communications",
  "flows": "Python version check flow leads to potential environment configuration; module imports do not involve data flow",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.setdefaultencoding, which is known to be a deprecated and potentially unsafe practice; conditionally reloading sys module for Python 2",
  "analysis": "The code detects if running under Python 2 and attempts to set the default string encoding to UTF8, which can be problematic and is often discouraged. The version variable is set but unused in this snippet. Imports are straightforward, importing environment and user management classes. No data is read from external sources, and no untrusted inputs are processed. The code does not perform any network operations, data storage, or security-sensitive actions beyond environment configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially unsafe practice of setting the default encoding in Python 2, which could lead to issues but does not appear malicious. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The overall security risk is low.",
