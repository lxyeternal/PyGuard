  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as legacy compatibility code for Python 2. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main concern is the use of deprecated practices, which pose maintainability issues but not security threats. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.1-0.2). The scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
