  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- The original code is a straightforward Django package compatibility snippet.\n- It imports `django` and `__version__`, then conditionally sets `default_app_config` based on Django version.\n- The `__all__` list controls exported symbols.\n- No external data sources, user input, or untrusted data handling is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The logic is standard and commonly used in Django packages for version compatibility.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identify the code's purpose as configuration based on Django version.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All correctly recognize this as standard, benign code with no security issues.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high, given the straightforward nature)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious intent)\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0 (no evident security issues)\n\nAll reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. The malware score is 0, matching the absence of malicious behavior. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear. The security risk is also 0, since no vulnerabilities or risky operations are present.\n\n- **Any assumptions that should be challenged?**  \n  The reports assume standard practices, which are justified. No hidden malicious intent or obfuscation is evident.\n\n- **Potential for higher risk scores?**  \n  No. The code is benign and standard. No reason to assign higher risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|-------|\n| 0         | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Justification:**  \n- The code is a simple compatibility check, with no malicious or obfuscated components.  \n- No external or untrusted data is involved.  \n- The logic is standard and well-understood.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The detailed reasoning confirms that the current scores are justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.**",
