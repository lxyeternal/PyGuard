  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration based on Django version compatibility",
  "sources": "Importing django module and __version__ from local module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or dangerous operations",
  "flows": "Importing django version -> conditional assignment of default_app_config and __all__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior; standard version check",
  "analysis": "The code imports the django package and retrieves a version constant. It then performs a version check to conditionally assign a configuration variable. The __all__ list controls exported symbols. The structure and logic are standard for compatibility handling in Python packages. No suspicious code, no external data input, no risky operations observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, purpose is to handle compatibility with different Django versions, and contains no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
