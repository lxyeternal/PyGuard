  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The original code is a straightforward version check and configuration snippet for a Django package.\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code imports Django, checks its version, and conditionally sets `default_app_config` and `__all__`.\n   - No untrusted data, external inputs, or risky operations are involved.\n   - The code appears standard and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as standard compatibility boilerplate.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - The summaries are aligned with the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - purpose: accurate\n     - sources, sinks, flows: correctly identified as benign\n     - anomalies: none\n     - analysis: sound\n     - conclusion: appropriate\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Risk and malware scores justification:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity or contain suspicious patterns.\n   - The `securityRisk` score is also 0, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all recognize the code as standard compatibility code.\n   - There are no speculative vulnerabilities or vulnerabilities inferred without basis.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the thorough analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a typical, harmless compatibility snippet.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Score | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0       | No malicious activity or suspicious behavior present.      |\n| Obfuscated      | 0       | Code is clear, standard, and unminified.                     |\n| Security Risk   | 0       | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or security issues detected.|\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is benign, standard boilerplate for Django compatibility, and poses no security threat.",
