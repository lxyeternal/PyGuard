  "purpose": "Configure module exports based on the Django version for a package related to PostgreSQL enhancements.",
  "sources": "Importing django and a local version module; reading django.VERSION",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is written or transmitted to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; version check influences module configuration but does not process untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django and a local version identifier. It conditionally sets the default_app_config if Django's version is below 3.2. The __all__ variable is used to specify public API exports. No external data inputs, user inputs, or untrusted data are involved. The logic is straightforward and standard for Django packages managing compatibility across different versions. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple version-based configuration for a Django package without any malicious behavior or security concerns.",
