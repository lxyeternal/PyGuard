  "purpose": "Compatibility check for Django versions, setting default_app_config conditionally and defining __all__ for module exports.",
  "sources": "Imports django and __version__ from local module; reads django.VERSION for version comparison.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; configuration variables are set internally.",
  "flows": "Version check influences setting of default_app_config and __all__, but no external data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard Django compatibility check, importing necessary modules, comparing Django version, and setting configuration variables accordingly. It contains no external data input, no data leaks, and no malicious or obfuscated elements. The logic is straightforward and widely used in Django packages for version compatibility. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard boilerplate for Django compatibility, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
