  "purpose": "Define module metadata and conditional application configuration based on Django version.",
  "sources": "Importing django, importing __version__ from local module.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "Import statements provide version info; conditional assignment affects module configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of version check is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django and a local version variable, then conditionally sets 'default_app_config' if Django's version is less than 3.2. This is typical for compatibility across different Django versions. The __all__ list is set accordingly. No signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard compatibility boilerplate for Django apps with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
