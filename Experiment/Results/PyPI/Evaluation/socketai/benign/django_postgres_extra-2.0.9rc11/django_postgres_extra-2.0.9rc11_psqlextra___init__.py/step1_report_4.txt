{
  "purpose": "This code sets the default application configuration for a Django project depending on the Django version and defines exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Importing 'django' module, importing '__version__' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink points detected; no output, network, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Import of 'django' influences version check; '__version__' is used for exports; no external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behavior. The version check and __all__ assignments are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django and a version variable. It conditionally assigns 'default_app_config' based on Django version, which is typical for compatibility. '__all__' is set to control module exports. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious patterns are present. The structure appears straightforward and typical of version-dependent Django configurations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django compatibility snippet with no malicious intent or security issues. It merely manages module exports and configuration based on Django version.",
