  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully in relation to the original code.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward compatibility check for Django versions, setting `default_app_config` conditionally and defining `__all__` for module exports. The code imports `django` and `__version__` from a local module, performs a version comparison, and sets variables accordingly. There are no external data inputs, no data sinks, no obfuscated or malicious code, and no signs of backdoors or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:**  \n  The code matches the description in all reports. No issues are present in the actual code snippet.\n\n- **Malware and obfuscation:**  \n  All reports correctly identify no malware or obfuscation.\n\n- **Logic and reasoning:**  \n  The version check is standard practice for compatibility; no suspicious patterns or assumptions are present.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:**  \n  No external data input or untrusted data processing is involved; the code is purely configuration-based.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk):**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No change needed.\n\n- **Risk score (>0.5):**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n- **Confidence levels:**  \n  All are 1, consistent with the straightforward analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- No report overstates or understates risk.  \n- The code is standard boilerplate for Django compatibility, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-understood pattern for managing Django version compatibility. There are no indicators of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No modifications or escalations are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.",
