{
  "purpose": "This code configures module exports and application setup based on the Django version, primarily for package initialization.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'django' module and version information from a local module.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "The code reads the Django version and sets module variables accordingly, but does not process external or untrusted data beyond the version check.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors. The version check and conditional exports are standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Django and version info, then conditionally sets 'default_app_config' if the Django version is below 3.2. It also defines '__all__' to control module exports. No malicious behavior or malware indicators are present. The code appears to be a standard configuration script for a Django package, with no suspicious or malicious code patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical configuration snippet for a Django package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
