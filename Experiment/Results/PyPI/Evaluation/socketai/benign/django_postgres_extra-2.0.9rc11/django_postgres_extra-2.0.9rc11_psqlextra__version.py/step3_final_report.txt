  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a string variable.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment of version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple version assignment, no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string '2.0.9rc11' to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no input/output, external calls, or dynamic behavior. The version string indicates a release candidate, which is typical in development stages. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and benign. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
