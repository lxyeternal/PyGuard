{
  "purpose": "Assigns the version string '2.0.9rc11' to the __version__ variable, typically used for package versioning.",
  "sources": "The code itself contains only a variable assignment; no input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted destinations or sensitive areas.",
  "flows": "No data flows since the code is a simple assignment statement.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a pre-release version string ('rc11') could suggest a development or release candidate, but this alone is not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, only setting a version string for the package. No input handling, no external data sources, no function calls, and no network activity. The version string indicates a release candidate, which is common in software development. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and typical for version declaration in Python packages. No malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
