  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - No input sources, data flows, external calls, or network activity are present.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The mention of the pre-release version ('rc11') as a potential anomaly is valid but not suspicious.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - The security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No issues in the reports warrant a risk score higher than 0.5.\n   - The code is purely declarative with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly reflecting no malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code's purpose.\n   - The presence of 'rc11' is noted but not considered suspicious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a simple, benign version declaration.\n- All reports correctly identify the lack of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is standard version declaration and poses no security threat.",
