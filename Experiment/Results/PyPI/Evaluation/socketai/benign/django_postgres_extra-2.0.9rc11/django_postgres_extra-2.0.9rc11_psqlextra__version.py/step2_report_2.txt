  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a version string to the `__version__` variable. There are no input sources, sinks, or data flows. The code is minimal and typical for package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' reasoning:**  \n   - The reports uniformly state that the presence of `'rc11'` (release candidate) is not suspicious. This is accurate; pre-release identifiers are common and not malicious.  \n   - No report mentions any obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or external dependencies, which is consistent with the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**  \n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.  \n   - The security risk score is 0, which aligns with the absence of any suspicious behavior.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   - No issues or suspicious behaviors are identified, so risk scores should remain at 0.  \n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   - Since the code only assigns a string to a variable, there is no indication of malicious activity.  \n   - The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize that the code is standard version declaration.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the code and analysis provided.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nThe code is a straightforward version string assignment, typical in Python packages. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign and typical for package versioning. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
