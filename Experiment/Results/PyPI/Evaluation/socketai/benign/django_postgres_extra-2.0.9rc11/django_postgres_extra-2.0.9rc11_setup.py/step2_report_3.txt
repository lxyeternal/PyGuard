  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, the validity of the reasoning, and the consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The main concern is the use of `exec()` to load `_version.py`, which could execute malicious code if that file is compromised.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to the `exec()` usage.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe use of `exec()` on an external file is a known security concern because it executes arbitrary code. While in typical setup scripts this is somewhat common, it does open a potential attack vector if the version file is tampered with. The report correctly identifies this as the main risk. No other suspicious code or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The malware score remains at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious intent beyond the risky `exec()`. The risk score could be slightly higher (e.g., 0.3) considering the potential for malicious code execution if the version file is compromised, but 0.2 is acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script runs static subprocess commands for code quality and testing, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe subprocess calls are static and predefined, reducing risk. No untrusted input is used, and no network activity or backdoors are present. The report's reasoning is correct; this is standard practice for setup scripts.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, with emphasis on the `exec()` on `_version.py` as the main concern.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 — slightly higher, acknowledging the potential risk.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe main concern is the use of `exec()`, which could execute malicious code if `_version.py` is compromised. The subprocess calls are safe as they are static. The reasoning is valid.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are reasonable. The malware score remains at 0, but the risk score could be marginally increased to reflect the potential danger of executing external code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The subprocess commands are static, and no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound; subprocess commands are predefined, and no suspicious activity is evident.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is straightforward, with no signs of malware or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- The **main point of concern** across multiple reports is the use of `exec()` to load `_version.py`. While this is common in some setup scripts, it can be exploited if the version file is malicious or tampered with.\n- The **subprocess calls** are all static and do not pose significant risks.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscated code is present.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** Given the use of `exec()`, a slightly higher score (e.g., 0.3) could be justified, but 0.2 is acceptable if the version file is trusted.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0.3** |\n\nThis reflects the main concern about executing external code via `exec()`, which could be exploited if the version file is compromised, but overall, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and well-reasoned. The only notable point is the `exec()` usage, which warrants caution but is not inherently malicious. The scores should remain low for malware and obfuscated, with a slightly elevated risk score to account for the potential danger of executing external code.",
