  "conclusion": "The code is typical for a setup script, with the primary security concern being the use of exec() to load version info. No malicious activity or backdoors are evident. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and the security risk score should be slightly elevated (~0.2-0.3) due to exec() usage, but overall, the package appears safe. It is recommended to replace the exec() pattern with a safer import method to mitigate potential risks."
