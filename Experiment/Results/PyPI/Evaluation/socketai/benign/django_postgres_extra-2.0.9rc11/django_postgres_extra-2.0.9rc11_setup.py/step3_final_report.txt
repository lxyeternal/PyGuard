  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'django-postgres-extra' package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and custom commands.",
  "sources": "Reads version info via exec() from 'psqlextra/_version.py'; reads README.md; defines subprocess commands for linting, formatting, testing.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_call() executions with static command lists; reading README.md; exec() on version file.",
  "flows": "exec() loads version info -> package setup; subprocess calls -> code quality and testing commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info from external file, which could execute malicious code if the file is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks, with subprocess commands being static and predictable. The main concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which can execute arbitrary code if the version file is malicious or tampered with. No other suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess calls are safe, as they do not process untrusted input. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with these observations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is typical for a setup script, with the primary security concern being the use of exec() to load version info. No malicious activity or backdoors are evident. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and the security risk score should be slightly elevated (~0.2-0.3) due to exec() usage, but overall, the package appears safe. It is recommended to replace the exec() pattern with a safer import method to mitigate potential risks.",
