  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured extension of Django ORM for PostgreSQL features, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors. The security risk is minimal and manageable with proper input validation outside these expressions. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting potential injection surface if misused, but effectively mitigated by quoting functions."
