  "purpose": "Define custom Django ORM expressions for handling PostgreSQL HStore fields, date/time epochs, and utility functions for conditional field selection and upsert operations.",
  "sources": "Code reads class attributes, method parameters, and database schema information such as alias, target, column, and field names.",
  "sinks": "Generates SQL snippets for HStore operations, column references, and PostgreSQL-specific constructs like EXCLUDED.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., values, field names, keys) flows through expression methods to generate SQL fragments for database queries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls detected. The code primarily constructs SQL expressions without executing arbitrary code or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various Django ORM expressions for PostgreSQL HStore handling, date/time epoch conversion, and conditional field selection. The classes use standard patterns for expression compilation (`as_sql`) and expression resolution (`resolve_expression`). No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or obfuscated constructs are present. The use of `quote_name` in `ExcludedCol` ensures safe quoting of column names, preventing SQL injection through identifiers. The `IsNotNone` utility safely constructs conditional expressions. Overall, the code appears to be standard ORM extension code for PostgreSQL with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of Django ORM expression classes and utility functions for PostgreSQL HStore and date/time operations. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious external interactions. The implementation appears secure and standard for its purpose.",
