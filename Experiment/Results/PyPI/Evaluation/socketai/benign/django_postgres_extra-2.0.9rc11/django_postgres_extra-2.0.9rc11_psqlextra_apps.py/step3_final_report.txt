  "purpose": "Standard Django AppConfig subclass that imports a local module in the ready() method for initialization purposes.",
  "sources": "Static import statement within the ready() method importing '.lookups.InValuesLookup'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import during app startup.",
  "flows": "Import from '.lookups' occurs during the execution of the ready() method, with no data flow beyond module initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward static import, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no secrets or external data sources.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Django AppConfig class that performs a static import of a local module during startup. It does not involve dynamic code, external data, network activity, or obfuscation. The import is typical for registering lookups or signals. No malicious patterns, secrets, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code. The slight risk score reflects the import pattern but does not indicate any actual threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django configuration with a static import for lookup registration. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concern. All reports are accurate and consistent; no adjustments are necessary.",
