{
  "purpose": "Configure a Django application named 'psqlextra' with a verbose name and import additional lookups when the app is ready.",
  "sources": "Import statement within the 'ready' method: 'from .lookups import InValuesLookup'. No user input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks. No code execution based on untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The import occurs during app initialization, not dynamically or from external input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and standard for Django app configuration. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass, setting app name and verbose name. The 'ready' method imports a module '.lookups'. This import is a common pattern in Django to initialize custom lookups or signals when the app loads. There is no dynamic code execution, no external data sources, and no suspicious behavior. The import appears to be for extending database lookups, which is a legitimate use case. No anomalies or malicious indicators are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django app configuration without any malicious behavior or security risks. It performs straightforward setup tasks typical for Django apps.",
