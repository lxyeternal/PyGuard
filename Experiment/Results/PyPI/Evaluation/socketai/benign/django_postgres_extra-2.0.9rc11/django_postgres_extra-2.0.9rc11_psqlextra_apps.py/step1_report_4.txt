  "purpose": "Django application configuration for the 'psqlextra' package, setting app name and verbose name.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .lookups module within the 'ready' method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code primarily imports a class during app initialization.",
  "flows": "During Django app startup, the 'ready' method is invoked, which imports 'InValuesLookup' from a local module.",
  "anomalies": "The import within the 'ready' method is standard for Django apps; no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig class with app metadata. The 'ready' method imports a local class, which is common for setting up lookups or signals. No untrusted input, no code injection, and no malicious behavior are evident. The import is straightforward and does not appear obfuscated or suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django app configuration with a typical import in the 'ready' method. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks.",
