{
  "purpose": "Django application configuration for the 'psqlextra' package, setting app metadata and importing a lookup class during initialization.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .lookups import InValuesLookup within the ready() method.",
  "sinks": "The import could be a sink if it executes malicious code or causes side effects, but as an import statement, it is generally safe.",
  "flows": "During the app's startup, the ready() method executes, importing InValuesLookup; no data flows or external communications are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; no hardcoded secrets, unusual patterns, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass, specifying the app's name and verbose name. In the ready() method, it imports a local module component, which is a common pattern for initializing app-specific behaviors. There are no indications of malicious activity such as network communication, data leakage, or hidden backdoors. The import statement itself is benign and standard in Django apps. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Django app configuration code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply initializes part of the app by importing a lookup class during startup.",
