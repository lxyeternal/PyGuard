  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their assessments, scores, and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a Django AppConfig subclass with a static import inside the `ready()` method.\n- The import is from a local module `.lookups`, importing `InValuesLookup`.\n- The code is straightforward, standard practice in Django apps for registering lookups or signals.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data, or obfuscation is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Evaluations:\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code itself is simple and correct; no issues are present.\n- The import statement is static and standard.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues are present.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as standard, with no malicious behavior.\n- The reasoning is consistent and well-justified.\n- The scores for malware and obfuscation are appropriately zero.\n- The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**Note:** The only minor point is that the reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0.1 or 0 in most cases, which is acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Score Analysis and Recommendations:\n\n**Malware Score:**\n- All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n- All assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n**Risk Score:**\n- Most reports assign 0 or 0.1. Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The one report assigns 0.1, which is acceptable but slightly overestimating; a more precise score would be 0.\n\n**Justification for higher risk:**\n- No justification needed; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of the Reports:\n- All reports are consistent in their reasoning and conclusions.\n- The scores align with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are high, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical Django app configuration with a static import for setting up lookups. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **The code is safe and standard.**\n- **Scores assigned are appropriate.**\n- **No changes needed.**\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
