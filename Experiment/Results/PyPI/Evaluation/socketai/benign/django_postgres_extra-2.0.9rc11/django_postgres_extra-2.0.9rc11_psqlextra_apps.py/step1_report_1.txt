  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration for the 'psqlextra' package.",
  "sources": "Import statement within the 'ready' method importing 'InValuesLookup' from local module.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data outputs or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; import is static.",
  "anomalies": "Simple import statement with no dynamic code execution, secrets, or obfuscation; nothing unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with basic metadata. The 'ready' method imports a lookup class from a local module, which is typical for registering signals or performing initial setup. The import is static and straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, external network calls, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be standard for a Django app configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django AppConfig with a simple import inside 'ready'. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security issues. Overall, it is safe.",
