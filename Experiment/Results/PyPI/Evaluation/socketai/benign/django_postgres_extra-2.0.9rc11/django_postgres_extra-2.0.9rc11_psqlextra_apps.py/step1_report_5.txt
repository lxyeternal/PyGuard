  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration for the 'psqlextra' package.",
  "sources": "No explicit external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow paths to untrusted data identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig class with minimal setup. The 'ready' method imports a lookup class from a local module, which is standard practice in Django apps to initialize components. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The import statement is straightforward and used to initialize the app's lookups when Django starts.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard Django application configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply initializes an app with a local import during startup, which is common practice.",
