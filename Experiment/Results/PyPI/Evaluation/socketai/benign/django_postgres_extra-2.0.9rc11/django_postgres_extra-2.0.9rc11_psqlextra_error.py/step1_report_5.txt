{
  "purpose": "The code aims to extract underlying PostgreSQL error information from Django database errors, specifically handling psycopg2 and psycopg errors.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the 'error' parameter (a Django db.Error object) and its __cause__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "Returns extracted error objects or error codes, which could be used downstream for logging or handling errors.",
  "flows": "Error occurs in Django, which wraps the underlying database error. The functions then access error.__cause__ to retrieve the original database error and extract error codes if available.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The use of type checking and conditional imports is standard. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard error extraction for PostgreSQL errors in a Django context, with proper handling of optional dependencies. No malicious behaviors or anomalies are present. The functions are straightforward, using conditional checks and type annotations to process error objects. The code seems intended for debugging or logging purposes and does not exhibit signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical utility for extracting PostgreSQL error details from Django exceptions. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behaviors. The structure and logic are clear and standard for error handling in Django applications.",
