{
  "purpose": "The code aims to extract underlying PostgreSQL error information from Django database errors, specifically focusing on errors from psycopg2 and psycopg3 libraries.",
  "sources": "Error objects from Django's db.Error, and potentially the __cause__ attribute of these error objects.",
  "sinks": "The functions access error.__cause__ and check types, but do not perform any data writes, network operations, or dangerous commands.",
  "flows": "Error object -> extract_postgres_error / extract_postgres_error_code -> access __cause__ -> type check against psycopg errors -> return specific error info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual data handling are present. The code contains some unnecessary type annotations and imports inside TYPE_CHECKING, but these are standard for type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code imports optional error classes from psycopg2 and psycopg3, handling import errors gracefully. It provides functions to extract the underlying database error and error code from Django errors by examining the __cause__ attribute. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The code's purpose is purely diagnostic. No network operations, data leaks, or backdoors are present. The only concern might be that the functions return sensitive error information, but this is expected for error handling and debugging purposes, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious utility for extracting PostgreSQL error details from Django exceptions. There are no indicators of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be safe and intentionally designed for error handling.",
