{
  "purpose": "The code aims to extract underlying PostgreSQL errors and error codes from Django database exceptions, specifically handling psycopg2 and psycopg3 errors.",
  "sources": "Reads exception objects (error.__cause__) when handling Django database errors.",
  "sinks": "Returns extracted error objects and error codes; no direct sinks that cause harm or data leakage.",
  "flows": "From Django db.Error to underlying psycopg2 or psycopg3 error objects, then to error code extraction functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains unused type annotations (e.g., 'Psycopg2Error: Optional[Type[_Psycopg2Error]]') outside function scope; no malicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to extract specific PostgreSQL errors and error codes from Django database errors, handling different psycopg versions and ImportError scenarios. It uses conditional imports and type checks to identify underlying errors. No external data input, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The only unusual aspect is the unused type annotations at the module level, which appear to be an error or artifact, not malicious. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. Overall, the code is a standard utility for error handling with no security risks or malware signs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility designed for error extraction from Django database exceptions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly handles multiple psycopg versions and potential import errors, serving a legitimate purpose in error diagnostics.",
