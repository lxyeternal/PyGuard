  "purpose": "The code aims to extract specific PostgreSQL error details from Django database errors, handling different psycopg versions.",
  "sources": "Reading error information from the 'error' parameter, importing psycopg errors conditionally.",
  "sinks": "Returning error cause and error codes, which could potentially leak internal error details if misused.",
  "flows": "Error passed to extract_postgres_error or extract_postgres_error_code, then the code inspects error.__cause__ to determine error type and extract details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The import error handling is standard for optional dependencies. No obfuscated or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports psycopg2 and psycopg errors, handling missing modules gracefully. It defines functions to extract underlying database errors and error codes from Django errors by examining the __cause__ attribute. No dynamic execution, no external network activity, and no suspicious logic. It relies on standard exception attribute inspection. The error extraction could reveal database error details, but this is expected behavior for debugging or error reporting, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs safe error extraction from Django database exceptions without any malicious intent. It handles optional dependencies gracefully and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code. The only concern is potential leakage of database error details, but this is typical in error handling and not inherently malicious.",
