  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for extracting PostgreSQL errors from Django exceptions. It handles dependencies gracefully and contains no malicious or obfuscated code. The minor security concern is potential leakage of error details, which is typical for such utilities. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0. The security risk score should be around 0.1-0.2, reflecting potential info leakage but not malicious intent. The overall assessment is that the code is safe, appropriate, and not malicious."
