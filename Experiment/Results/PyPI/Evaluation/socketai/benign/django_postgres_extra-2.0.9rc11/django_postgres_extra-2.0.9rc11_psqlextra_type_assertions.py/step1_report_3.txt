{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to identify whether a given value is a Django QuerySet or a SQL query (with or without parameters).",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'value' in functions: is_query_set, is_sql, is_sql_with_params",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the functions only perform type checks and do not execute code or interact with external systems",
  "flows": "Input 'value' flows through type-checking functions to determine its nature; no data flow to external systems or sensitive outputs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The functions are simple type checks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type and Django ORM modules, then defines three functions: is_query_set, is_sql, and is_sql_with_params. These functions perform straightforward type checks to determine if the input 'value' is a Django QuerySet or a SQL string, optionally with parameters. There are no dynamic code executions, external interactions, or suspicious behaviors. The functions are safe and serve as helpers for type validation. No signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely performs type checks related to Django QuerySets and SQL queries. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks detected.",
