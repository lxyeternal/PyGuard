  "purpose": "Utility functions to identify Django QuerySet objects and analyze potential SQL query strings or parameter tuples.",
  "sources": "Input values provided to functions: any data passed to is_query_set, is_sql, and is_sql_with_params.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; functions only perform type checks without executing or passing data to external systems.",
  "flows": "Type check functions evaluate input types; no data flow leading to execution or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises simple type-check functions using isinstance, with no execution, data manipulation, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of zero for malware and security risk, and high confidence levels. The functions serve as utility helpers within Django projects and do not pose security threats or malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, non-malicious, and free of obfuscation or security issues. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
