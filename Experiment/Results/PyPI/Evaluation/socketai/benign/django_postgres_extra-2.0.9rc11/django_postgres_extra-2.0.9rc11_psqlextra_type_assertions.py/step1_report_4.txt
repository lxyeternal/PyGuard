{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to identify if a given value is a Django QuerySet, a raw SQL string, or a SQL query with parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'value' parameter passed to each function.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data is processed in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities; functions only perform type checks.",
  "flows": "The functions check the type of 'value' to determine if it is a QuerySet, SQL string, or SQL with parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The functions are simple type checkers: 'is_query_set' verifies if a value is a Django QuerySet; 'is_sql' checks if a value is a string potentially representing SQL; 'is_sql_with_params' checks if a value is a tuple containing a SQL string and parameters. All functions rely solely on isinstance checks without executing or manipulating data. No external data inputs, network connections, or dangerous operations are present. The code appears to be utility functions for type validation, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe utility functions for type identification, with no signs of malicious code or security risks. It appears intended for benign use within a Django application, with no indication of supply chain or malware concerns.",
