{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to identify whether given data is a Django QuerySet, a SQL string, or a tuple of SQL string with parameters.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include any external or internal data passed to functions: 'value' parameter in is_query_set, is_sql, and is_sql_with_params.",
  "sinks": "The functions themselves do not contain sinks that execute or process data in a potentially dangerous manner. They merely identify data types.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'value' into type checks within each function; no execution or processing of data occurs that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code only performs straightforward type checks and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three simple type-checking functions for Django QuerySet objects, SQL strings, and SQL with parameters. No data processing, execution, or manipulation occurs. The functions are purely informational and do not execute or evaluate the data beyond type checks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious data handling. The code is standard, clean, and aligned with common patterns for type validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs harmless type checks to distinguish between Django QuerySets and SQL queries. It does not contain malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. It appears safe and standard for its intended purpose.",
