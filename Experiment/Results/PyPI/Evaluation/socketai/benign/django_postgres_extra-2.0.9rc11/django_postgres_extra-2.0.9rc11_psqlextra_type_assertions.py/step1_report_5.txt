{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to identify if a given value is a Django QuerySet, a raw SQL query string, or a tuple containing a SQL query and bind parameters.",
  "sources": "The functions read input data through the parameters of each function: 'value'.",
  "targets": "The code does not write to any external system or data sink; it solely performs type checking and identification.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is passed to the functions, which check its type and structure to identify if it is a QuerySet, SQL string, or SQL with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The functions are simple type checks with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. No external calls or data leaks are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward type-checking functions for identifying Django QuerySet objects and SQL query structures. It uses 'isinstance' for these checks, which is safe and standard practice. The functions do not perform any data manipulation, network operations, or code execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is well-structured, simple, and serves as utility checks within a larger application. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious flow. It simply aids in identifying query types.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for type identification with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe and does not contain any suspicious behavior.",
