  "purpose": "Utility functions to identify if a value is a Django QuerySet, a SQL string, or a SQL query with parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function input parameters: 'value' in each function.",
  "sinks": "No significant sinks; the functions only perform type checks without executing code or SQL.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is checked against types; no data flows to external systems or effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple type-check functions to identify QuerySet objects, SQL strings, and parameterized SQL queries. These functions only perform isinstance checks and do not execute or manipulate data beyond type verification. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity is present. The functions could potentially be used in larger codebases to process SQL-related data, but as-is, they are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward utility functions for type checking without any malicious intent or security issues. It poses no security risks or malware concerns.",
