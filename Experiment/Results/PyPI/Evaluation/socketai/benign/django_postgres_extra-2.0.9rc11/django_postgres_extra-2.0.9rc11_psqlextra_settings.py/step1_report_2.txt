{
  "purpose": "Provides context managers to temporarily modify PostgreSQL session settings such as configuration parameters and search path within a transaction.",
  "sources": "Reads database connection state, executes SQL commands to retrieve and set configuration parameters, fetches current search path.",
  "sinks": "Executes SQL commands with parameters, including dynamic SQL for setting configuration options and search path modifications.",
  "flows": "The code fetches current settings, temporarily modifies them using 'SET LOCAL', then restores previous settings after the context exits.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. Usage of standard Django and PostgreSQL features with proper parameterization.",
  "analysis": "The code manages PostgreSQL session parameters safely by querying current values, applying temporary changes with 'SET LOCAL', and restoring original settings. No input data from untrusted sources directly influence critical operations beyond parameter substitution, which is securely handled. No malicious or maliciously misleading patterns detected. Functions utilize Django ORM and database cursor execution with parameterized queries, reducing SQL injection risk. No obfuscated or malicious code structures observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard, secure session parameter management in PostgreSQL using Django, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. Proper handling of session settings is evident, and no suspicious activities or backdoors are identified.",
