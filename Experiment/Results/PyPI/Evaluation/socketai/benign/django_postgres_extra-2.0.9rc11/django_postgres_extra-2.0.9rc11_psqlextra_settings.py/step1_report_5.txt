{
  "purpose": "Provides context managers to modify PostgreSQL session parameters such as configuration options and search path temporarily within a transaction.",
  "sources": "Reads the current database connection state, transaction status, and current search_path settings from the database.",
  "sinks": "Executes SQL commands to set or reset configuration parameters and search paths, potentially using untrusted data if the options or search_path lists are user-supplied.",
  "flows": "Input from options or search_path arguments flows into SQL command construction, which then executes on the database cursor. The original database settings are fetched and stored before modifications, then restored after the context.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code. The SQL commands are constructed dynamically, but with proper parameterization to prevent SQL injection. The code respects transaction boundaries and restores settings appropriately. No suspicious network activity or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages PostgreSQL configuration parameters safely by using parameterized queries and context managers to ensure temporary changes are reverted. It checks that SET LOCAL commands are only used within transactions, raising exceptions otherwise. The construction of SQL commands employs quote_name and parameter placeholders, reducing injection risks. No malicious or unusual behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The functions are well-structured for intended database configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears secure, implementing PostgreSQL session parameter management properly. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The usage is controlled and adheres to best practices for database operations.",
