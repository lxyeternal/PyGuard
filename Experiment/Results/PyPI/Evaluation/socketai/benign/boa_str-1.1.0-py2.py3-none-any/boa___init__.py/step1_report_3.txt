  "purpose": "Convert strings to snake_case format.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'string' passed to constrict() function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the transformed string.",
  "flows": "Input 'string' -> regex substitutions and transformations -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. The regex patterns are straightforward and serve string transformation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 're' module for regular expression operations and defines several regex patterns for whitespace, non-word characters, capital letter transitions, and underscore deduplication. The 'constrict' function handles None inputs by returning an empty string and performs string transformations: replacing whitespace with underscores, removing non-alphanumeric characters, inserting underscores before capital letters, converting to lowercase, and removing multiple underscores. All operations are string manipulations intended for formatting. There is no network activity, data leakage, or malicious payload. The regex patterns are simple and targeted, with no indication of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward string formatting utility with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and functional for its intended purpose.",
