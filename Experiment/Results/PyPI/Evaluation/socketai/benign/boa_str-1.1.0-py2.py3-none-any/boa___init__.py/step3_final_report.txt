  "flows": "Input string -> regex substitutions -> output string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard regex-based string processing",
  "analysis": "The code uses regex patterns to replace whitespace/hyphens with underscores, strip non-word characters, insert underscores before uppercase letters, convert to lowercase, and deduplicate underscores. It handles None inputs gracefully. No external data access, network calls, or obfuscation are present. The regex patterns are standard and serve typical string normalization purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or security vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward, with no hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for string normalization to snake_case. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive components. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
