  "purpose": "Convert strings to snakecase.",
  "sources": "Input string provided to constrict() function.",
  "sinks": "The function processes the input string through regex substitutions; no external data sinks or untrusted outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex substitutions (spaces_re, strip_re, first_cap_re, all_cap_re, dedupe_re) -> output string in snakecase.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of regex patterns appears standard and safe. No dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no hidden network activity or system manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code takes an input string, transforms whitespace to underscores, strips non-word characters, converts camelCase or PascalCase to snake_case via regex, and removes multiple underscores. All operations are standard string processing with regex; no external data sources, no network calls, and no suspicious behavior are present. The regex patterns are straightforward and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The function performs a common text normalization task with appropriate safety measures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign string transformation function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely on input data with standard regex operations, and there are no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
