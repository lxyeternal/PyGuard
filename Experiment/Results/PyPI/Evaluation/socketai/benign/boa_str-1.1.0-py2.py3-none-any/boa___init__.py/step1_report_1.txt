  "purpose": "Convert strings to snake_case format by replacing spaces and special characters, and handling casing conventions.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'string' in the constrict() function.",
  "sinks": "Return value of the constrict() function.",
  "flows": "Input string -> whitespace substitution -> character stripping -> regex transformations for casing -> deduplication of underscores -> output return.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Usage of regex operations appears standard. No network or file system access. No obfuscated or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of regex patterns for whitespace, non-word characters, uppercase letter transformations, and underscore deduplication. The constrict() function applies these regex substitutions sequentially to convert an input string into snake_case, handling casing and special characters appropriately. There are no evident signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code is straightforward and serves a string transformation purpose, with no suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard string manipulation utility for converting strings to snake_case. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and intended solely for formatting purposes.",
