{
  "purpose": "Convert strings to snakecase format for consistent variable naming or text formatting.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'string' in the 'constrict' function, which is the string to be transformed.",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs the processed string; no external data sinks or data leaks are apparent.",
  "flows": "The function reads the input 'string', applies multiple regex substitutions, and returns the transformed string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Usage of regex is standard for string manipulation. No obfuscated or suspicious code features are present. The regex patterns are straightforward and serve the purpose of string transformation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several regex patterns to identify spaces, non-word characters, capital letter patterns, and underscores. The 'constrict' function processes the input string by replacing whitespace with underscores, removing non-word characters, inserting underscores before capital letters, converting to lowercase, and collapsing multiple underscores. The logic appears standard for string normalization to snake case. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious side effects. The code is simple, clean, and performs string formatting only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign string processing utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It efficiently converts input strings to snakecase without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
