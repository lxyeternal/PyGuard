  "purpose": "Utility functions for XML/HTML processing and cross-Python compatibility, including string encoding, namespace management, and tag formatting.",
  "sources": "Functions process strings internally; no external data sources or untrusted input handling.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; functions perform internal string manipulations and regex-based escaping.",
  "flows": "Input strings (e.g., tags, text) are escaped and encoded for serialization; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code; regex used for character escaping is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code provides compatibility layers and encoding utilities for XML/HTML serialization across Python versions. It uses regex for escaping special characters, which is typical for such tasks. No external data handling, network operations, or system modifications are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected. The functions are standard and safe, serving as utility routines without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for XML/HTML processing with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
