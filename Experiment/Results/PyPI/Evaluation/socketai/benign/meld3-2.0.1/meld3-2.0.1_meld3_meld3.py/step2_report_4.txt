  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\nThe original code only contains straightforward import statements:\n```python\nfrom . import parse_xml\nfrom . import parse_html\nfrom . import parse_xmlstring\nfrom . import parse_htmlstring\n```\nThere are no functions, data processing, dynamic code, or external interactions. The comments '# BBB' are non-informative and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n2. **Assessment of Reports:**\nAll five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no anomalies, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks. They correctly identify that these are static import statements within a package, with no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Error or Flaw in Reports:**\n- No errors are evident in the reports. They are consistent and accurate based on the code provided.\n- The comments '# BBB' are noted, but they are benign and do not influence security assessment.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct since there's no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n- **Confidence:** All are at 1, indicating full confidence, which is justified.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Justification:**\n- Since the code only imports modules, there is no execution of untrusted code, no data flows, and no suspicious patterns.\n- The comments do not suggest malicious intent.\n- No evidence of backdoors, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n7. **Final Expert Judgment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is entirely benign and does not pose any security threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n- The code is straightforward module imports with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- Scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo further action needed.",
