{
  "purpose": "The code imports four modules from the current package, likely related to parsing XML and HTML content, with no dynamic behavior or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the current package modules: parse_xml, parse_html, parse_xmlstring, parse_htmlstring.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows; import statements do not involve data processing or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Comments '# BBB' are benign placeholders; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements with benign comments. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or external interactions are present. The comments are non-informative and do not suggest malicious intent. All indicators point to a benign, straightforward module import pattern with no security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
