  "purpose": "The code imports multiple parsing modules related to XML and HTML, likely for processing structured data within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the current package for parse_xml, parse_html, parse_xmlstring, parse_htmlstring",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no execution of untrusted data or external actions",
  "flows": "No data flows observed; only static imports are declared",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The comment '# BBB' does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from the current package modules, with no additional logic, data handling, or external interactions. The comments are non-informative and do not suggest malicious activity. Since the code only performs module imports, there are no apparent security risks, malware, or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing straightforward module imports for XML and HTML parsing functionalities. No malicious behavior or security concerns are evident.",
