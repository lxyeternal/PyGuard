  "purpose": "Import various parsing modules (XML and HTML parsers) within a package.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the current package namespace.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only imports modules without executing further logic.",
  "anomalies": "All imports are straightforward with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports four modules: parse_xml, parse_html, parse_xmlstring, parse_htmlstring, all from the local package. Each import is annotated with a comment 'BBB', which provides no security or malicious context. There is no execution, data processing, or untrusted input handling visible. The simplicity and clarity suggest no malicious intent or anomalies. The code appears to be standard module imports, likely part of a larger package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement for parsing modules with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
