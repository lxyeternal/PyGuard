  "flows": "Imports are static references; no data flow from untrusted sources or sinks",
  "anomalies": "Comment 'BBB' appears repeatedly; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing four modules. The comments 'BBB' do not indicate any malicious activity and may be placeholders or markers. There are no dynamic executions, user inputs, or network interactions. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or other anomalies are present. Overall, this code simply imports modules and does not perform any actions that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
