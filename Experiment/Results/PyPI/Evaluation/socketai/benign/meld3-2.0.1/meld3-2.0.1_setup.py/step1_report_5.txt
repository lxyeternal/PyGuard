{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the 'meld3' Python package, including version checks, metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info from sys.version_info, package metadata, and static strings in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity; version checks are straightforward, and metadata is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code structures, or dynamic code execution. The version checks and package setup are standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment validation based on Python version, sets up package metadata, and calls setuptools.setup() with static parameters. All actions are typical for a package setup script. No dynamic code, external data processing, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code is well-structured and follows standard conventions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is intended solely to configure package installation and metadata.",
