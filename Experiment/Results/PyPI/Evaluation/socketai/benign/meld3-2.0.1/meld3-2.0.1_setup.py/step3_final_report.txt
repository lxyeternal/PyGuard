  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script performing environment validation and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version checks",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed or external outputs",
  "flows": "Version info from sys.version_info used to enforce environment constraints",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version checks and metadata definitions",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that performs environment validation via sys.version_info, raises exceptions if requirements are not met, and defines package metadata such as name, version, description, classifiers, author info, license, dependencies, and package modules. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or processing of untrusted input. The version checks are simple and standard. The package is marked as unmaintained, which could pose future security concerns due to lack of updates, but this does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and follows best practices for setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only concern is its unmaintained status, which could lead to future vulnerabilities if undiscovered issues exist, but this is not indicative of malicious intent. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score could be marginally increased to 0.1 to reflect the unmaintained status, but given the current analysis, it remains very low. Overall, the package is safe to use, with no immediate security concerns.",
