  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the meld3 Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, string literals, package metadata variables, setup() function arguments",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network or data leaks present",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; version checks are straightforward",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors; version validation is standard",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment validation for Python versions, defines package metadata, and calls setup() for package installation. The version checks are standard and do not process external input dynamically. No obfuscated or malicious code segments are present. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It simply enforces minimal Python version requirements and provides package metadata.",
