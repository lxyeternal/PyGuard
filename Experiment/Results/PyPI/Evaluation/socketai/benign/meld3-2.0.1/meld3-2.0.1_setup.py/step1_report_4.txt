{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'meld3' package, including dependency and metadata definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools and sys modules; version checks; static assignment of package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or data; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations beyond standard setup.",
  "flows": "Reads system Python version info to enforce compatibility; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code; the code is straightforward setup logic. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version checks and raises exceptions if incompatible Python versions are used, which is standard practice. It defines package metadata and dependencies, all in a static manner. There are no inputs from external sources, no dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious patterns. The package description notes it is unmaintained but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe and typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. It mainly enforces Python version compatibility and defines package metadata.",
