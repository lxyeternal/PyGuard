  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only concern is its unmaintained status, which could lead to future vulnerabilities if undiscovered issues exist, but this is not indicative of malicious intent. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score could be marginally increased to 0.1 to reflect the unmaintained status, but given the current analysis, it remains very low. Overall, the package is safe to use, with no immediate security concerns."
