  "sources": "sys.version_info, hardcoded strings, and package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potentially vulnerable operations.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.version_info influences flow control, but no untrusted data flows to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. Version checks are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment checks and defines package metadata for distribution. It only uses standard library modules and static strings. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. No suspicious behavior or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup.py file for packaging, with no signs of malicious code or sabotage. It appears safe and benign.",
