{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define platform-specific selection functions, constants, and a set of foreign function interface (FFI) definitions for interacting with a native library, likely for text or data processing using Objective-C and Core Foundation types.",
  "sources": "The code reads system architecture info from sys.maxsize and objc.arch; it also contains hardcoded string constants for enums and function signatures; no user input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with external native functions via FFI, which could be a sink if untrusted data were passed, but in this static definition, no direct untrusted data handling is visible.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are observed; the code is primarily defining constants, function signatures, and platform-specific helper functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious anomalies detected. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or backdoors. It appears to be a configuration or interface layer for native library interaction.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs platform detection (sys.maxsize, objc.arch) and defines platform-specific functions. It then sets up dictionaries with constants, enums, and function signatures for FFI calls to native Objective-C and Core Foundation libraries. There are no indications of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The code is static and appears to be part of a larger library or framework, likely for text or data analysis, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the static analysis, the code is a configuration and interface layer for native library calls, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any data handling, network activity, or other suspicious operations.",
