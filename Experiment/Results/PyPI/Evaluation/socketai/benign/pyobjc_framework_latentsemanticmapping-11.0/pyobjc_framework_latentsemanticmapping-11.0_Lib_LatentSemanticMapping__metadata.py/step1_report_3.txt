{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a generated Python module for interacting with Objective-C classes and functions related to a framework involving text analysis, clustering, and data management.",
  "sources": "Code reads system architecture (sys.maxsize, objc.arch), imports modules (objc, sys), and accesses constant strings and functions defined within.",
  "sinks": "Function definitions and constants are set, but no direct data outputs or external network communication are evident. No clear sink points for untrusted data handling or leakage.",
  "flows": "Initial system info influences function definitions; constants and functions are set up for potential use elsewhere, but no actual data flow, processing, or network transmission occurs in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is largely static, generated, and contains no obvious malicious logic. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is detected. The structure is complex but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is generated and appears to set up constants, functions, and types for an Objective-C bridging framework. It uses conditional logic based on system architecture and CPU architecture. No network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The absence of dynamic code execution, no external data transfer, and lack of suspicious function calls indicate no malicious intent. The code is primarily configuration and setup code with no indication of malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This is a generated configuration module for Objective-C interactions with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not perform any harmful actions, data leaks, or malicious control flow. The code is safe based on current analysis.",
