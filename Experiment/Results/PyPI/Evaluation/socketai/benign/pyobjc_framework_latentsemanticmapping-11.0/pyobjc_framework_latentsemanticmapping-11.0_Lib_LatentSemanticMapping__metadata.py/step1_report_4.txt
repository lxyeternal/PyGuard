{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define platform-specific selection functions, constants, and function signatures for Objective-C interoperation, likely as part of a larger application or library for text processing or machine learning.",
  "sources": "Data is read from system properties (sys.maxsize, objc.arch), string constants, and external modules (objc, sys, typing).",
  "sinks": "Function signatures, constants, and data structures are set up but no external data is directly used or sent in this snippet. No immediate sinks for untrusted data are evident.",
  "flows": "Conditional functions select platform-specific code based on system architecture; constants and functions are defined statically. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious code is present. The code is straightforward configuration for Objective-C interoperation.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up platform-specific functions and data structures for Objective-C based APIs, likely used for text or data processing. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or harmful operations. It does not perform network activity, file modifications, or contain code that would suggest sabotage. No anomalies such as hidden backdoors or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to serve as a configuration or interface layer for Objective-C interaction within a larger application. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this code snippet.",
