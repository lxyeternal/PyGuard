{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package wrapper for the 'LatentSemanticMapping' framework on macOS, facilitating integration with the framework via PyObjC.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (sys.path), module imports (pyobjc_setup), and package metadata (VERSION).",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that process untrusted data; it only configures package setup.",
  "flows": "The flow involves setting up the environment and executing the setup function to prepare the package, with no data flowing from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and typical of a Python package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, modifies sys.path, and calls a setup function from pyobjc_setup to configure the package. It references minimal documentation and relies on standard package setup practices. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activities. The script is purely for packaging and does not perform any network operations, data collection, or other potentially malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script for a macOS framework wrapper, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not exhibit any signs of malware or obfuscation.",
