  "purpose": "Set up and configure Python wrappers for the LatentSemanticMapping framework on macOS.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), sys.path.insert, import pyobjc_setup, setup() call",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data processing points present",
  "flows": "Code imports and modifies sys.path, then calls setup with package details; no untrusted data flow detected",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is a standard setup script for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies sys.path to include the current directory, then imports a setup function from pyobjc_setup, and calls setup() with package metadata. No user input handling, no network activity, no credential handling, and no obfuscated code. The code is typical for package setup and does not perform any suspicious operations. It simply defines package configuration for distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for a Python package providing wrappers for a macOS framework. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior, and there are no security risks present.",
