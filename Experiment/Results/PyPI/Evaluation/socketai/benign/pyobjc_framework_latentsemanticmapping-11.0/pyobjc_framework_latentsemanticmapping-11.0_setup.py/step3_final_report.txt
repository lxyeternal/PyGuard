  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'LatentSemanticMapping' framework wrapper on macOS using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file path (__file__) and imports modules os, sys, and pyobjc_setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or external command execution present.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> modifies sys.path -> calls setup() with static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a framework wrapper, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute external commands. The code is clear, minimal, and typical for such purposes. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, which are appropriate. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores and assessments are consistent and appropriate.",
