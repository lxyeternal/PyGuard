  "purpose": "Set up and configure Python package wrappers for the LatentSemanticMapping framework on macOS using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ for current directory, importing os, sys, and pyobjc_setup; defining version string.",
  "scopes": "The code manipulates sys.path, imports modules, and calls setup functions with package metadata.",
  "flows": "sys.path modification -> import pyobjc_setup -> call setup() with package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or unusual code patterns. The code appears to be a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration for packaging a framework wrapper, using standard libraries and pyobjc. It does not include network activity, code execution, or data manipulation beyond package setup. The minimal and straightforward nature indicates no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for packaging PyObjC framework wrappers. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
