{
  "purpose": "The code provides a setup configuration for the PyObjC framework, including custom build, testing, and installation commands, primarily for packaging and distributing the framework on macOS.",
  "sources": "Various: subprocess calls (e.g., sw_vers, clang, xcrun), environment variables (e.g., CFLAGS, PATH), file system reads (e.g., SDKSettings.plist, pyobjc-api.h), and network-related code (via subprocess and pkg_resources).",
  "sinks": "Subprocess outputs used for version info, SDK detection, and compiler checks; file reads for configuration files; manipulation of sys.path and sys.modules; potential for network or environment data leaks through subprocess and environment variables.",
  "flows": "Sources like subprocess outputs and environment variables feed into version checks, SDK detection, and compiler validation; file system reads and sys.path modifications influence build and test processes; no evidence of data being sent externally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to retrieve system info (macOS version, SDK info, compiler version) is standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected. No obfuscated code or unusual control flow. The code is structured for build automation and testing, with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs system introspection (macOS version, SDK info), compiler validation, build customization, and test suite execution. All subprocess calls and file reads relate to configuration and environment setup typical of a build script. No data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or suspicious file manipulations are evident. The code's purpose is to facilitate building and testing the PyObjC package on macOS systems, with standard practices for environment and compiler checks. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for a Python package, performing environment setup, build configuration, and testing routines. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. Its structure and functions are consistent with typical build and distribution scripts, with no suspicious or harmful actions detected.",
