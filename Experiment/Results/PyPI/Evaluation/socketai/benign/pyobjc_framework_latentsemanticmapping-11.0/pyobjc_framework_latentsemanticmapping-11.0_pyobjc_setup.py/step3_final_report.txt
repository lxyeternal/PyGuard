  "purpose": "Build and test setup script for PyObjC framework, involving environment detection, configuration, and test execution.",
  "sources": "Uses subprocess to gather system info (macOS version, SDK info, compiler version), reads configuration files, environment variables, and dynamically loads test modules.",
  "sinks": "System info commands via subprocess, file reads, sys.path and sys.modules modifications, dynamic import of test modules.",
  "flows": "Standard data flow from environment variables and system commands into build configuration and testing routines; no evidence of data exfiltration or malicious network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors. Use of subprocess and dynamic imports are typical for build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs routine build and test setup operations, utilizing subprocess calls for environment detection and configuration. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or malicious data flows are present. The reliance on environment variables and subprocesses is standard in such scripts, with minimal security risk. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.15-0.2) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured build and test setup for PyObjC, with no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The minor risk score reflects typical build environment reliance, not actual threats.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
