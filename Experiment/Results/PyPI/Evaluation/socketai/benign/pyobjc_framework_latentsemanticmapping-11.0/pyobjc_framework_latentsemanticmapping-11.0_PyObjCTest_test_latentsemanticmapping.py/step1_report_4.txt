  "purpose": "Unit tests for the LatentSemanticMapping framework bindings in Python, verifying constants, types, and functions.",
  "sources": "File reading from /usr/share/dict/README to add words to text objects.",
  "sinks": "File reading source could potentially inject untrusted data into the system; no other sinks are identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the dictionary file into text creation and addition functions, but these are part of normal processing, not malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Usage of file reading is standard, and no network or system modification functions are invoked.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs unit testing on the framework's constants, types, and functions. It reads from a system dictionary file, which is benign in this context. No code injection, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. All functions are called in a test context, and no data leaks or malicious actions are evident. No obfuscation or unusual language features are used. The code structure is straightforward, aiming at verifying API correctness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for a framework interface with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses normal file I/O and function calls within a testing context. No malware or security threats are detected.",
