  "anomalies": "No actual code present beyond a comment; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior visible",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a comment indicating 'Unittests' with no actual code content. Without any implementation, there are no sources, sinks, data flows, or anomalies to analyze. Since no executable code exists, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet contains only a comment and no executable code. Therefore, there are no security concerns, malicious behavior, or anomalies present. The snippet appears to be a placeholder or header for test cases rather than active code.",
