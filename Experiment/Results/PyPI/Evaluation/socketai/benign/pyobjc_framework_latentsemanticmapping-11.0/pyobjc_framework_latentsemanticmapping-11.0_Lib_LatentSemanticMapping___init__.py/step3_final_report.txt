{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically loads an Objective-C framework, sets up __dir__ and __getattr__ functions for attribute access, and cleans up internal modules, serving as a framework binding setup routine.",
  "sources": "Import statements, objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr call, assignment to globals(), deletion of sys.modules['LatentSemanticMapping._metadata']",
  "sinks": "Assignment of __dir__ and __getattr__ functions to globals, deletion from sys.modules",
  "flows": "Code imports modules -> creates framework directory and getattr functions -> assigns functions to globals -> deletes internal module from sys.modules",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute creation (__getattr__), assignment to globals, deletion of internal module from sys.modules",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard framework binding setup by dynamically creating directory and attribute functions for the framework, assigning them globally, and cleaning up internal modules. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The use of dynamic attribute functions and module deletion is typical in such contexts and not inherently malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are identified. The code's purpose is legitimate, and the overall security assessment is that it poses minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign framework setup routine for macOS Objective-C bindings. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
