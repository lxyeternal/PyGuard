  "purpose": "Initialize and set up the LatentSemanticMapping framework by dynamically importing and configuring framework components.",
  "sources": "Import statements: sys, Foundation, objc, and internal _metadata module. Usage of objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr to generate directory and attribute getter functions.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to globals()['__dir__'] and globals()['__getattr__'], deletion of sys.modules entry for '_metadata'.",
  "flows": "Imports → createFrameworkDirAndGetattr generates dir and getattr functions → assigns to globals → deletes _metadata module from sys.modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr to dynamically create framework directory and attribute accessors. Deletion of internal module from sys.modules; no explicit code validation or sanitization steps. No direct network or file operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically sets up a framework by leveraging Objective-C runtime features via objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr. It imports essential modules and removes the _metadata module from sys.modules to possibly prevent further access or to clean up namespace. The deletion of the _metadata module and the assignment of custom __dir__ and __getattr__ functions indicate dynamic attribute management, common in plugin or extension frameworks. No malicious payloads, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to serve as a setup utility for a framework without any obfuscated or malicious code. Given the limited scope and lack of external data handling, it poses no apparent security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a framework setup routine utilizing dynamic attribute generation via Objective-C runtime functions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on its content. The code is primarily for framework initialization and cleanup.",
