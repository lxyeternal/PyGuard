  "purpose": "Set up and configure the LatentSemanticMapping framework for use within Python, dynamically creating framework directories and getters.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, Foundation, objc, _metadata); framework path and creation functions",
  "sinks": "Dynamic attribute creation and deletion of modules; no apparent data leak points",
  "flows": "Imports -> Framework setup -> Dynamic directory and attribute functions -> Cleanup of module",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic creation of framework directories and attributes; deletion of a module from sys.modules; no docstrings or documentation, potentially obscuring intent",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports system libraries and creates framework directory and getter functions using objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr. It then assigns these functions to global __dir__ and __getattr__ for lazy attribute access. Finally, it deletes a metadata module from sys.modules to possibly conceal its internal workings. These behaviors are typical for setting up a bridge to system frameworks and do not inherently indicate malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard framework setup routine for bridging Python with a macOS system framework. While it employs dynamic attribute creation and module cleanup, these are common in such bridging code and do not suggest malicious intent. There is no evidence of malware, data exfiltration, or sabotage within this snippet.",
