{
  "purpose": "Initialize and set up the LatentSemanticMapping framework by dynamically importing framework components and modifying module globals.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, Foundation, objc, and internal _metadata module; use of objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr to dynamically generate __dir__ and __getattr__ functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential dynamic attribute access via __getattr__, which could be used to access arbitrary attributes, but no explicit unsafe operations or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The setup function imports modules, creates dynamic directory and attribute functions, assigns them to globals, and deletes the _metadata module reference, then the setup function is immediately called and removed.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic framework loading and modification of __dir__ and __getattr__, which could be unusual but are standard in dynamic plugin or framework setups. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code is evident. The immediate removal of _setup() is a typical pattern to prevent re-execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs dynamic framework loading via Objective-C bridge, creating custom directory and attribute functions for the framework. It manipulates module globals for dynamic attribute access, which is common in plugin architectures. No malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The approach is standard for system framework integrations on macOS. There is no obfuscated or suspicious code behavior. The removal of the _setup function right after execution prevents re-initialization, which is normal. Overall, the code seems to serve a legitimate purpose of setting up framework access without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for framework integration on macOS, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It employs dynamic loading and attribute management typical of such system-bound modules. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
