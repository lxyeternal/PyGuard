  "purpose": "Initialize and set up a Python wrapper for the LatentSemanticMapping framework on macOS, dynamically creating framework directory and attribute accessors.",
  "sources": "Import statements, use of objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr to dynamically generate directory and attribute getter functions.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to __dir__ and __getattr__, deletion of sys.modules entry for _metadata.",
  "flows": "Imports sys and other modules, calls createFrameworkDirAndGetattr with framework info, assigns functions to globals, deletes a module entry.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic creation of __dir__ and __getattr__, deletion of a module from sys.modules, use of inline dynamic code with createFrameworkDirAndGetattr.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically sets up framework accessors using Apple's Objective-C bridge via objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr. It imports system and framework modules, then assigns the generated directory and attribute functions to global variables for later use. It also deletes a specific module from sys.modules, which could be unusual but is not inherently malicious. There are no signs of data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code behavior. The use of dynamic attribute creation is typical for bridging frameworks but warrants caution if used maliciously; here, it appears to be legitimate setup code for framework access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup routine for dynamically linking a macOS framework with Python, with no evident malicious intent. The use of dynamic attribute generation and deletion from sys.modules is typical in such context and not suspicious per se.",
