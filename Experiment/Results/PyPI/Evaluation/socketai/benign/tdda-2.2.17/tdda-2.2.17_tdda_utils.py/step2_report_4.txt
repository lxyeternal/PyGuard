  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports systematically.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if reported issues are present in the code**\n\n- The reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response content. Since there's no detailed report content, I cannot verify if specific issues are present in the code based on these reports.  \n- The code itself appears to be a set of utility functions and a class, with no obvious malicious or vulnerable patterns.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary**\n\n- The reports lack any descriptive details beyond \"Empty response.\"  \n- Without additional context, these reports do not specify any security issues, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior.  \n- The \"error\" message seems to be a placeholder or a generic message rather than an actual security concern.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores given to each issue**\n\n- Since no detailed issues are provided, and all reports are identical with \"Empty response,\" it’s unreasonable to assign high risk or malware scores.  \n- The scores should be minimal or zero unless there's evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- No evidence suggests any vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.  \n- The code is straightforward utility functions with no external input handling that could be exploited.  \n- Therefore, assigning a high risk score is unjustified.\n\n**Step 5: Review malware scores**\n\n- The code does not perform any network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration.  \n- No malware behavior is evident.  \n- Malware score should be zero.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports do not specify any assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities.  \n- Without concrete evidence, assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are unfounded.\n\n**Step 7: Check for consistency between scores and report content**\n\n- Given the lack of detailed issues, scores should be low, reflecting no known or suspected vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Code review:**\n\n- The code appears safe and does not contain malicious or vulnerable patterns.  \n- The functions are utility helpers with no security implications.\n\n**Based on the reports:**\n\n- All reports are empty and do not provide actionable information.  \n- No issues are identified or implied.\n\n**My estimate for scores:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                               |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score   | 0.0               | No malicious activity detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated Score| 0.0             | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.            |\n| Risk Score      | 0.0               | No vulnerabilities or security issues identified.          |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports lack sufficient detail to identify any issues.\n- The code itself is benign and does not warrant concern.\n- Final scores should be minimal, reflecting no risk or malware concerns.\n\n**Critical note:** Always seek detailed report content to accurately assess security risks.",
