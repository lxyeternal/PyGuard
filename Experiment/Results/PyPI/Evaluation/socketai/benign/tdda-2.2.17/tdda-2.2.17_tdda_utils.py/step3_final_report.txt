  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling null values, path expansion, string quoting, and a dummy object class.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read external input; `os.path.expanduser()` reads user path info; `DQuote()` processes string input; `Dummy` initializes attributes from kwargs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; functions perform local string and path operations only.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; functions operate independently on provided arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises simple utility functions and a dummy class, with no network, file, or command execution. `nvl()` replaces nulls, `handle_tilde()` expands user paths safely, `DQuote()` escapes backslashes and newlines but not all special characters, and `Dummy` creates a flexible object. No security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are evident. The reports are empty, providing no additional context. Given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The empty reports do not indicate any issues. Scores should reflect very low risk and no malware or obfuscation presence.",
