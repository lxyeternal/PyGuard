{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'tdda', including package data, dependencies, and entry points, for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'tdda.version', reads 'README.md' file, lists directory contents for data files, and accepts external dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no network or file writing operations based on untrusted input; primarily configuration code.",
  "flows": "Uses version info and file listings to configure package metadata and data files for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code. Uses standard setup patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: importing modules, reading static files, defining data collection functions, and calling setup() with package info, data files, dependencies, and entry points. No input validation or user input handling is present. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed. The code is straightforward, typical for a Python package setup script, and does not contain code that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It performs expected functions for packaging a Python project without any suspicious or malicious code patterns.",
