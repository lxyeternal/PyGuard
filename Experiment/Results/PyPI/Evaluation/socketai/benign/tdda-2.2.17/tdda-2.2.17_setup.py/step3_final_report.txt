{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for configuring and distributing the package.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md, imports version info from local module, directory traversal for package data collection.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, no network activity, no code execution of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "File reading for long description, directory traversal for package data, importing version info.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() without a context manager, which could lead to resource leaks but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with straightforward logic. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. The only minor concern is the open() call without a context manager, which is a style issue but not security-related. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard packaging code with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The minor resource leak issue does not elevate the security risk. Overall, the package appears safe for use.",
