  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'tdda' Python project, including data files, entry points, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for long description and gathers files from specified directories for package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present. The script mainly handles file system operations and package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' to include in package metadata, collects files from directory structures to package, and defines entry points for CLI commands.",
  "anomalies": "The 'data' function recursively collects files from directories; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are evident. The code structure is typical of setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports version info securely from the package subdirectory. It reads local files without executing or processing untrusted input. The 'data' function performs directory traversal safely to gather files for packaging, respecting exclusions. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is present. All dependencies are standard and specified with version constraints. The entry points define CLI commands without malicious behavior. Overall, the code serves its intended purpose without signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package, with no malicious behavior, supply chain security risks, or suspicious anomalies detected. It securely reads local files, collects package data, and defines entry points for command-line tools.",
