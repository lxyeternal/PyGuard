{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the tdda Python project, including data files and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file; importing version from tdda.version; reading directory contents for data files; environment variables indirectly via setuptools and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Reading files and directory contents to build package data; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or hidden backdoors; straightforward package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily uses standard setup functions and directory traversal for package data. It imports version info from a local module and reads a README file. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or untrusted input handling is present. No network activity, file manipulations beyond package data collection, or other suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
