  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the tdda Python library, including package data, entry points, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description, importing version from tdda.version, listing directories for package data, environment variables (via os), and setup configuration inputs.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows directly lead to untrusted data being executed or leaked; no code injection or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Reading the file to populate long_description -> Gathering package data files -> Configuring setup parameters -> Installing dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' without context manager (potential resource leak), but no malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks using setuptools. It reads the README.md file for description, dynamically gathers data files from subdirectories, and specifies dependencies and entry points. The code does not execute untrusted input or perform network operations. The only noteworthy point is the open() call without a context manager, which could be improved but is not malicious. No obfuscated code, code injection, or malware indicators present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The code performs standard packaging functions safely.",
