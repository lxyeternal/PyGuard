{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'tdda'. It defines package metadata, dependencies, data files, and entry points for command-line scripts.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing version from tdda.version, listing directory contents for data files, and defining setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or executes untrusted data. No external data sinks or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading package data files, importing version info, and configuring package installation parameters. There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard setup operations, directory listing, and package configuration without any obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures using setuptools, including reading a README file, listing directory contents for package data, importing version info from a local module, and defining dependencies and entry points. The functions used are straightforward, and no dynamic code execution or untrusted data handling is observed. The directory traversal and data listing functions are typical for packaging scripts. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It primarily handles package metadata and file inclusion, with no suspicious behaviors identified.",
