  "purpose": "A testing utility for comparing strings and files with features for ignoring patterns and re-writing reference outputs, primarily used in test-driven data analysis.",
  "sources": "File reads for expected data, environment variable 'TDDA_FAIL_DIR' for fail directory, command-line arguments for behavior flags.",
  "sinks": "Writing actual output files, copying files, printing diff suggestions, and logging messages.",
  "flows": "Input data from files or strings flows into comparison functions; failures trigger writing output files and diff reports.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in 'normalize_function' ('trstrip' instead of 'rstrip'), but no malicious intent or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file and string comparisons with optional ignoring of patterns and re-writing of reference files. It uses environment variables and command-line args in typical ways. No network activity, no code injection, no backdoors, and no obfuscation are present. The only issue is a benign typo that could cause runtime errors if 'rstrip' is used with rstrip=True, but it does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe testing utility designed for verifying textual output. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The minor typo is a bug but not security-related. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the potential for file overwriting but within normal testing practices.",
