The low security risk score is appropriate, with a minor concern regarding untrusted zip extraction, which is a standard operation in such contexts. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in supply chain scenarios where source integrity is maintained."

The minor typo is a bug but not security-related. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the potential for file overwriting but within normal testing practices."
