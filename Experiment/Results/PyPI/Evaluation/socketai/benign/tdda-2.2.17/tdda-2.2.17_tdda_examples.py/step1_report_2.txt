{
  "purpose": "The code copies example files from a source directory to a specified destination, including unzipping account data from a zip archive.",
  "sources": "Reads input from filesystem: example source directories, zip files, and script arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "File read/write operations, directory creation, and extraction of zip files; no direct data leakage or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Source: sys.argv input or filesystem reads -> Sink: file operations and zip extraction.",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.system-like commands via os.mkdir, shutil.rmtree, and zipfile extraction; no obvious hardcoded secrets or backdoors. No obfuscated code or malicious API misuse detected. No network connections or suspicious data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs filesystem operations such as copying files and unzipping archives. It includes functions to copy example files, handle directories, and extract zip files. There are no indications of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or secret exfiltration mechanisms. The code relies on standard libraries and typical file handling logic, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors. The only potential concern could be the extraction of zip files, but this is a common benign operation. No suspicious behaviors or malware patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard file management tasks with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It securely copies files and extracts data as intended, with no indicators of supply chain attacks or malware.",
