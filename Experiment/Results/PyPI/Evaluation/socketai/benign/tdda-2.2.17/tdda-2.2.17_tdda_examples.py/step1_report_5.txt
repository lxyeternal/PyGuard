{
  "purpose": "The script copies example files from a source directory to a specified destination, including unzipping account data when needed.",
  "sources": "Reads from local directories, zip files, and file system functions such as os.listdir and zipfile.ZipFile.",
  "sinks": "File read/write operations; zip extraction; printing to stderr; os.mkdir, os.rmdir, and sys.exit.",
  "flows": "Reads source files and directories; copies data to destination; extracts zip contents; handles user input via sys.argv.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no dynamic code execution; no obfuscated code; no network activity; standard file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical file copying and extraction tasks from local directories, with filtering for certain file types and directory names. It includes safe practices such as ignoring cache directories and skipping certain file extensions. No external network calls, no execution of untrusted code, and no suspicious data handling observed. The use of zipfile.ZipFile is for local zip extraction, not malicious. No anomalies indicating malicious intent or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script designed to copy example files and handle zip archives locally. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs standard file I/O operations safely.",
