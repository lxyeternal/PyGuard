  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for copying example files and extracting a known archive. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is detected. The low security risk score is appropriate, with a minor concern regarding untrusted zip extraction, which is a standard operation in such contexts. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in supply chain scenarios where source integrity is maintained."
