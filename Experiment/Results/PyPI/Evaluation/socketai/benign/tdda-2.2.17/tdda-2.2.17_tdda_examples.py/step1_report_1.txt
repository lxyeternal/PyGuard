{
  "purpose": "The script copies example files from a source directory to a specified destination directory, including handling zip files and recursive copying of directories.",
  "sources": "Reads from the filesystem: source directories, zip files (accounts.zip), and user input via command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "File read/write operations, directory and zip extraction functions, printing to stderr, and process exit calls.",
  "flows": "User input (destination directory) influences file copying operations; zip file extraction reads from zip archive and writes to filesystem; recursive directory traversal reads from source and writes to destination.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'r' mode to open files for reading; potential for reading large or untrusted files. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No obfuscated code detected. The only dynamic operation is file and directory handling, which is standard for file copying scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file and directory copying, with additional handling for zip files containing account data. It includes safeguards such as ignoring cache directories and skipping certain file types (.pyc, ~). The script accepts user input for destination directory and performs necessary validations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The usage of standard Python libraries for file handling and zip extraction indicates routine behavior. No obfuscation or malware patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard utility for copying example files, including zip extraction. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It operates with typical file handling and user input processing, with no suspicious activities detected.",
