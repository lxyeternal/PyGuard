  "purpose": "A utility script to copy example files from source directories to a specified destination, including unzipping a specific archive ('accounts.zip') and handling directory traversal.",
  "sources": "File system reads via os.listdir, open() calls for copying files, zipfile.ZipFile for extracting 'accounts.zip'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; file reads and writes are standard, with no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Source directories are read; files are copied directly or unzipped into the destination directory.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file copying and zip extraction operations using Python's os, shutil, and zipfile modules. It handles directory traversal carefully, skipping cache directories and certain file types. The zip extraction is straightforward but could be risky if the archive is malicious; however, this is a common operation in such utilities. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is readable and well-structured, with appropriate error handling for file operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for copying example files and extracting a known archive. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is detected. The low security risk score is appropriate, with a minor concern regarding untrusted zip extraction, which is a standard operation in such contexts. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in supply chain scenarios where source integrity is maintained.",
