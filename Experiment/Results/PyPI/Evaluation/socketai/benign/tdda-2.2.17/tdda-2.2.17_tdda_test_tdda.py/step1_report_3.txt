{
  "purpose": "This script runs all tests associated with the TDDA framework, primarily for testing and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (TDDA_CONFIG_TESTS), imported modules, sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Environment variable setting (os.environ), print statement, potentially imported test modules",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence import and execution flow; sys.argv triggers test execution; imported modules may execute code upon import",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors detected. Usage of environment variables is standard for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script sets environment variables to control test configurations and imports various modules from the 'tdda' package. The main function triggers the execution of all tests. The code relies on standard testing patterns, environment variables, and module imports. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are observed. The code appears to be a straightforward test runner for the 'tdda' testing framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a test runner for the TDDA framework with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It uses environment variables and imports modules that likely execute tests. There are no suspicious behaviors or malicious code detected.",
