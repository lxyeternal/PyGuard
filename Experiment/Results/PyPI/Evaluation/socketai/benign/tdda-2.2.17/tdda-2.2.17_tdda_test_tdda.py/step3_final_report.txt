  "purpose": "A script to run all TDDA tests, managing environment variables and importing necessary modules to execute test cases.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'TDDA_CONFIG_TESTS', module imports, command-line arguments via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "ReferenceTestCase.main() execution, environment variable manipulation",
  "flows": "Environment variable check -> conditional import -> setting environment variables -> calling main test runner",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard test runner pattern, minimal environment variable use",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test runner that conditionally imports modules based on environment variables, sets an environment variable to indicate testing mode, and executes all tests via ReferenceTestCase.main(). It does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity. The environment variable usage is typical for configuration. No malicious payloads or suspicious logic are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign test runner with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
