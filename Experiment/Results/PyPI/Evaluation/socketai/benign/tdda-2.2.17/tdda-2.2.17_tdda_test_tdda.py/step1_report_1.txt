{
  "purpose": "Run all TDDA tests for the project, including configuration, reference tests, constraints, and serial metadata tests.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (TDDA_CONFIG_TESTS), standard input (sys.argv), imported test modules",
  "sinks": "Environment variable check influences test configuration, potentially affecting test environment, but no direct data leaks or malicious data flow identified",
  "flows": "Environment variable TDDA_CONFIG_TESTS affects conditional import; sys.argv influences test execution; environment variable 'TDDA_TESTING' set during test run",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; the code primarily manages test execution setup",
  "analysis": "The code sets an environment variable indicating testing mode, conditionally imports test configuration modules based on environment variables, and runs all tests via a main function. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or malicious behaviors are evident. It appears to be standard test runner setup with no external data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The environment variable usage is straightforward and related to test configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard test runner for the TDDA testing framework with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It only manages test execution and environment setup.",
