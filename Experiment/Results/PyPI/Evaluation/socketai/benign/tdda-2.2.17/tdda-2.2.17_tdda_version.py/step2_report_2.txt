  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines version components as integers: `TDDA_MAJOR_VERSION = 2`, `TDDA_MINOR_VERSION = 2`, `TDDA_EDIT = 17`.\n- Constructs a version string `TDDA_VERSION` using string formatting.\n- Assigns `version = TDDA_VERSION`.\n- When run as main, prints the version string.\n\n**Review of Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no untrusted input, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior.\n- The purpose is solely to define and display a version string.\n- No anomalies, no external data sources, no dynamic code execution.\n- The analysis in each report correctly concludes that the code is benign and serves a simple version reporting function.\n\n**Assessment of Scores:**\n- Confidence: 1 in all reports is justified, as the code is very simple and the analysis is consistent.\n- Obfuscated: 0, because there's no obfuscation.\n- Malware: 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- SecurityRisk: 0, since there's no indication of security issues.\n\n**Potential Issues or Inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities that are based on assumptions; the code is evidently safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risk.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**Final note:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is as benign as it appears. No further action is necessary.",
