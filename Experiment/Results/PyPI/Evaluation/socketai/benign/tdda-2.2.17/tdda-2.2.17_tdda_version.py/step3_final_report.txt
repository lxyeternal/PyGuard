  "purpose": "Define and display a static version string for the software.",
  "sources": "Static integer constants for version components; string formatting to create version string.",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputs the version string to standard output.",
  "flows": "Constants -> string formatting -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no dynamic or external data sources.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version components as static integers, formats them into a version string, and prints it when executed as the main module. There are no inputs, external dependencies, or dynamic code execution. The code is simple, clear, and serves solely to report version information. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The confidence level of 1 is justified given the straightforward analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version display utility with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
