  "purpose": "Define and display a version string for a software component.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version components (TDDA_MAJOR_VERSION, TDDA_MINOR_VERSION, TDDA_EDIT); string formatting to create TDDA_VERSION; assignment to 'version'; print statement.",
  "sinks": "The print function outputs the version string; no untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "Version components are formatted into a string and then printed; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version number components as integers, constructs a version string using string formatting, and prints it when executed directly. There are no inputs, external data, or suspicious activities. The code is straightforward and appears to serve as a simple version display utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script merely defines and outputs a version string, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
