  "purpose": "Define and display a version string for a software component.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version components and the __name__ check for main execution.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs the version string to standard output.",
  "flows": "The version string is constructed from internal constants and printed when executed as a script.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The versioning logic is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version components as integers, formats them into a string, and prints this string if the script is run directly. There are no input sources or untrusted data flows. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to serve a basic version reporting purpose without any external data handling or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple version information display with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign and intended for basic version reporting.",
