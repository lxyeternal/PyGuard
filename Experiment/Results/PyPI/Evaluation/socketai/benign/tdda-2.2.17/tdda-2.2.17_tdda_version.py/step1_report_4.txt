  "purpose": "Define and display a version string for the software",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version components (TDDA_MAJOR_VERSION, TDDA_MINOR_VERSION, TDDA_EDIT)",
  "sinks": "The print function outputs the version string to the console",
  "flows": "The version string is constructed from hardcoded variables and then printed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with no obfuscation or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version components as integers, formats them into a version string, and prints it when executed as the main module. No user input, external data, or sensitive information is involved. The structure is simple, and there are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves a basic purpose of defining and printing a version number. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
