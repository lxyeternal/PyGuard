{
  "purpose": "Provides Python support libraries for test-driven data analysis, referencing different modules such as referencetest, constraints, and rexpy.",
  "sources": "Imports from tdda.version and local modules referencetest, constraints, rexpy.",
  "targets": "No data input/output operations, network communication, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and sets a version alias; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports components of the tdda library and assigns the version to __version__. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or network activity. All imports appear standard for a Python library. No indications of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package module initialization with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It simply imports and exposes components of the tdda package.",
