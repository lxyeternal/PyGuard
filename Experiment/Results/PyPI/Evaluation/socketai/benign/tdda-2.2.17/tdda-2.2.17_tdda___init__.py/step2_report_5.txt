  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as primarily consisting of documentation comments and straightforward import statements.\n- No data inputs, outputs, network communications, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The version import is standard for package modules.\n- The overall confidence in benignity is high (score 1), and malware or obfuscation scores are zero across all reports.\n\n**Specific Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Issue Presence:**  \n   - The code matches the description; it only contains docstrings and import statements.  \n   - No malicious code, data flows, or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the benign nature of the code.  \n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Review:**  \n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the code content.  \n   - Security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate given the benign analysis.  \n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**  \n   - None of the reports assign risk scores above 0.5; all are 0, which is justified given the lack of any malicious indicators.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's static analysis.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis, accurately reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n\nGiven the uniformity and thoroughness of the reports, I concur with their assessments. The code is a standard package module with no security concerns.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- Maintain high confidence.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and free from malicious or obfuscated content. The reports are accurate and justified.",
