  "purpose": "Provides documentation and import statements for the tdda Python package, which supports test-driven data analysis, constraints discovery, and regular expression inference.",
  "sources": "Static strings and import statements",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external outputs observed",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; only package setup and documentation",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of package documentation and straightforward import statements. It imports version information and core modules for reference testing, constraints, and regex inference. There are no functions, data processing, external network calls, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package initialization script with no malicious activity or security risks.",
