  "purpose": "Provides documentation and import statements for the tdda Python library, supporting test-driven data analysis, constraints discovery, and regex inference.",
  "sources": "Import statements from tdda.version and submodules referencetest, constraints, rexpy; documentation string at the beginning.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; no external data transmission or system modification.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no data processing or external communication identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code primarily consists of documentation and imports.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward module with a docstring explaining package functionality and import statements for various submodules. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external calls are present. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or data leaks. The content appears to be a standard package initialization file with documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module initialization with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely imports public modules and contains descriptive documentation, indicating a safe and standard library structure.",
