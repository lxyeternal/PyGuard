{
  "purpose": "The code provides documentation and import statements for the tdda package, supporting data analysis and testing utilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the tdda package modules and the version import from tdda.version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not handle user input, network data, or external data flows.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and contains documentation strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and descriptive docstrings, with no dynamic code, data processing, or external communication. The absence of user input, network activity, or malicious constructs indicates a benign and standard package initialization module. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest no security risks or malicious intent. All signals point to a safe, well-structured, and non-malicious code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified based on the static, documentation-only nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
