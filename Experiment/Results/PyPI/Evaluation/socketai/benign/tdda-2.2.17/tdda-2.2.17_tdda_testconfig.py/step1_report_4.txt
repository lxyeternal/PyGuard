{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of unit tests that gather system configuration information, including environment variables, system commands, and library versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables ('PATH'), executes system commands ('type tdda' and 'which tdda'), and imports Python modules (numpy, pandas).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that lead to data leaks or system modification. Output is primarily printed to stdout.",
  "flows": "Sources include environment variables, system commands, and module imports. These are only printed, with no data sent externally or stored elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, backdoors, or hardcoded credentials are present. The code only performs system info gathering without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward unit test module that reports system and environment information. It runs system commands, accesses environment variables, and inspects library versions. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious data exfiltration. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network communication beyond standard system commands, or contain hidden backdoors. Its structure and purpose are benign and consistent with system diagnostics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign system information gathering script used for debugging or environment verification. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security flaws.",
