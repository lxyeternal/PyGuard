{
  "purpose": "The script is a diagnostic utility to display system command information, environment variables, and package versions.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (PATH), executes system commands ('type tdda' and 'which tdda'), and imports Python modules (numpy, pandas).",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to standard output; no data is sent elsewhere. No evidence of untrusted data affecting system or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and command outputs are printed directly; no untrusted input flows into dangerous sinks like system modification or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.popen() to run shell commands, which could be risky if input is manipulated; however, commands are static strings. No use of dynamic execution or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs environment inspection and version reporting. It reads environment variables and executes fixed shell commands using os.popen(). These commands are static and intended for system diagnostics. No user input handling, no network activity, and no data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No suspicious behavior such as backdoors, malicious data collection, or code obfuscation is evident. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical diagnostic scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign diagnostic utility for system and environment inspection. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. Its use of os.popen() is standard in such scripts, with no evident malicious intent.",
