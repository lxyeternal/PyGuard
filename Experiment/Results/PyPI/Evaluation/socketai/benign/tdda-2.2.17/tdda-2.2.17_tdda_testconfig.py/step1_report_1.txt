{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform system environment inspections and version checks for certain Python packages, likely for diagnostic or informational purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system commands ('type tdda', 'which tdda') via os.popen, environment variable 'PATH', and sys.path",
  "sinks": "Output to console via print statements; no direct untrusted data sinks, no network or file write operations observed",
  "flows": "Reads from environment variables and system commands; outputs to console; no flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.popen to execute system commands, which could be exploited if input was manipulated; however, command strings are static, so no injection risk here. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment inspection by executing system commands and printing environment variables. It employs standard modules like os, sys, and unittest, with no code obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The use of os.popen is generally safe here because the commands are static strings. There are no network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors present. Overall, this appears to be diagnostic code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving diagnostic purposes without malicious or security-risk behavior. No indicators of malware or security vulnerabilities detected.",
