  "purpose": "A script to run all TDA framework tests, setting environment variables and conditionally importing configuration modules based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('TDDA_CONFIG_TESTS', 'TDDA_TESTING'), standard library imports, and test invocation functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; the code only sets environment variables and calls test functions.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence imported modules and test execution; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward test runner with standard practices. Minor typo in comment ('enviroment' instead of 'environment'), but non-security relevant.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured test orchestrator that sets environment variables, conditionally imports modules, and runs tests via ReferenceTestCase.main(). No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Environment variables are used for configuration, which is typical in testing scripts. No network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The minimal risk score accounts for environment variable influence but does not indicate a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign test runner with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The environment variable manipulations are typical for test configurations. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
