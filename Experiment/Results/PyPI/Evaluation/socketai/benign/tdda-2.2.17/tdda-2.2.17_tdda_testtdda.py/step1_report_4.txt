{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to run a suite of tests related to the TDDa framework, including reference tests, constraint tests, and configuration checks.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'TDDA_CONFIG_TESTS', imported modules, and command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is written or sent to external systems. The script primarily executes test functions and sets environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences conditional import; command-line arguments are passed to test runner. No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. The code structure is straightforward, focusing on test execution. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific testing modules and sets environment variables to control test behavior. Conditional import based on environment variable is standard practice. The main function sets a testing flag and invokes the test runner. All actions are related to testing procedures with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test execution script for the TDDa framework. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply runs a suite of predefined tests based on environment settings and command-line inputs.",
