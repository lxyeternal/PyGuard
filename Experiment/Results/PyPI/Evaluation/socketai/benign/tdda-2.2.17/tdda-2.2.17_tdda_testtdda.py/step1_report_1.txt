{
  "purpose": "This script runs all tests related to the TDA (Testing Data and Data Analysis) framework, including configuration and reference tests.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'TDDA_CONFIG_TESTS'; imported modules and their internal data sources (not explicitly shown); system environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potentially influenced by environment variables, but no direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'TDDA_CONFIG_TESTS' influences import behavior; setting 'TDDA_TESTING' environment variable influences test execution; main function calls test suite execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to control test configuration; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed; code is straightforward test runner.",
  "analysis": "The code sets an environment variable to indicate testing mode, conditionally imports configuration modules based on an environment variable, and runs all tests via a main function. There is no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity. It primarily functions as a test orchestrator using the TDA framework. The environment variable manipulation and test invocation are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate test runner for the TDA framework with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply manages test execution based on environment variables.",
