  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on code signals such as obfuscation, malicious payloads, and insecure practices.",
  "sources": "Code segments involving dynamic execution (`exec`, `getattr`), network requests, environment variables, and system calls.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into `exec`, network communication, environment variable access, and system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources like dynamic code execution and environment variables feed into potential sinks such as network functions, system calls, or reflection-based code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `exec`, reflection (`getattr`), dynamic code features, hardcoded URLs, and network/system calls without clear validation or sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits dynamic features (`exec`, `getattr`) which are often used in obfuscated or malicious scripts but are also common in legitimate complex code. No concrete malicious payloads or suspicious network domains are identified. The code's use of environment variables and system calls warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The absence of hardcoded secrets or damaging operations suggests low risk. The scores assigned in the reports align with these observations, with moderate concern primarily due to dynamic code features and network interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not show definitive signs of malware or heavy obfuscation. The overall security risk is low, with some features warranting monitoring. The scoring in the reports is consistent with the observed signals, and no significant discrepancies are present.",
