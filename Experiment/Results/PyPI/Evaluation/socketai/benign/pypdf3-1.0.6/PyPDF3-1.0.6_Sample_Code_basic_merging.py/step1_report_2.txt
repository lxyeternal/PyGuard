{
  "purpose": "The code combines multiple PDF documents into a single output PDF file by appending and merging specified pages from input files.",
  "sources": "Reads input PDF files 'document1.pdf', 'document2.pdf', 'document3.pdf' via open() calls, and the 'merger.write()' method writes to output file.",
  "sinks": "Writes the combined PDF output to 'document-output.pdf'.",
  "flows": "Input files are read through open(), data flows into the PdfFileMerger methods (append and merge), then the merged PDF is written to disk via merger.write().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Usage of deprecated library 'PyPDF3' is noted but not malicious. No data exfiltration, network communication, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely opens input PDF files in binary read mode and appends/merges pages as specified, then writes the result to an output file. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The use of 'PyPDF3' is a deprecated library but does not imply malicious intent. The code performs standard PDF manipulation operations without any suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate PDF merging tasks without any malicious or maliciously intended behavior. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity. Overall, it appears safe.",
