  "conclusion": "The code is a benign PDF merging utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0 given the lack of vulnerabilities. Slightly elevated risk scores in some reports (0.1-0.2) due to library deprecation are justifiable but not necessary. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy."
