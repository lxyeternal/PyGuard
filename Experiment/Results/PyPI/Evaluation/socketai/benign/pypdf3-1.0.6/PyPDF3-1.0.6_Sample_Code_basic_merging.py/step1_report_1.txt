  "purpose": "Merge multiple PDF documents into a single output PDF file.",
  "sources": "Reading PDF files from disk (document1.pdf, document2.pdf, document3.pdf).",
  "sinks": "Writing the merged PDF to 'document-output.pdf'.",
  "flows": "Input files are opened for reading; their content is processed by PdfFileMerger; the output is written to a file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscated code. The code uses standard file handling and a well-known library (PyPDF3).",
  "analysis": "The code imports a PDF merging library, opens three PDF files in binary mode, and performs standard PDF merge operations (append and merge at specific positions). It then writes the combined result to an output file. The library used is PyPDF3, which is a common open-source PDF handling library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code performs legitimate PDF processing tasks. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward PDF merging utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates purely on local files without any suspicious behavior.",
