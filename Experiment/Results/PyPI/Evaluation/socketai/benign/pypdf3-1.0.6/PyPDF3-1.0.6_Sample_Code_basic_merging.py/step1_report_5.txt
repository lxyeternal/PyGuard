{
  "purpose": "Merge and manipulate multiple PDF documents by appending and inserting specific pages.",
  "sources": "Reading input PDF files: 'document1.pdf', 'document2.pdf', 'document3.pdf'.",
  "sinks": "Writing the output PDF file 'document-output.pdf'.",
  "flows": "Input files are read (sources) and processed via PdfFileMerger methods, then written to an output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Usage of deprecated or less common library 'PyPDF3' may indicate outdated code but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the PdfFileMerger class from PyPDF3, opens three PDF files for reading in binary mode, performs page manipulations (append and merge), and writes the merged PDF to a new file. There are no suspicious data flows, no untrusted user input handling, nor external network communications. The code performs straightforward PDF merging operations, which are typical and benign. No anomalies like code obfuscation or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves a legitimate purpose of merging PDFs with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard PDF manipulation script without any suspicious activity.",
