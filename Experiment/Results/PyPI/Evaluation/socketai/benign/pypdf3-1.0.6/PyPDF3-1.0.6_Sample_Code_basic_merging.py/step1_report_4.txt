  "purpose": "Merge and manipulate multiple PDF documents into a single output PDF.",
  "sources": "Open file streams for 'document1.pdf', 'document2.pdf', 'document3.pdf'.",
  "sinks": "Write merged PDF data to 'document-output.pdf'.",
  "flows": "Input file streams are read by 'merger.append' and 'merger.merge' methods, then the output is written to a file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No use of environment variables or insecure data handling observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code opens three PDF files in binary read mode, uses the PyPDF3 library to merge and manipulate these PDFs, then writes the result to a new PDF file. All operations appear to be straightforward PDF processing tasks without any hidden or malicious actions. There are no network communications, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code does not process untrusted input beyond reading local files, and it does not include any potentially malicious commands or code injections.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard PDF merging operations with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical use of the PyPDF3 library for document manipulation.",
