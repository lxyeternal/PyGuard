  "purpose": "Merge multiple PDF documents into a single output PDF file.",
  "sources": "Reading PDF files from disk using open() for 'document1.pdf', 'document2.pdf', and 'document3.pdf'.",
  "sinks": "Writing the merged PDF to disk using open() for 'document-output.pdf' and merger.write().",
  "flows": "Input files are opened and passed to PdfFileMerger methods (append and merge), then output is written to disk with merger.write().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution, and no unusual data handling. Usage of standard PDF merging functions without unusual parameters.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward PDF merging operations: opening three PDFs, merging pages from the first two, appending the third, and saving the output. No user input or external network interactions are involved. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are detected. The code uses standard library functions in a typical manner, and the file operations are straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard PDF merging task without any signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It reads and writes files in a typical way, with no indication of supply chain or security risks.",
