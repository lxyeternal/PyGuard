{
  "purpose": "Merge multiple PDF documents into a single output PDF with specific page operations.",
  "sources": "Reads input PDFs ('document1.pdf', 'document2.pdf', 'document3.pdf') in binary mode.",
  "sinks": "Writes the merged PDF to 'document-output.pdf'. No untrusted data handling or external network activity.",
  "flows": "Input files are opened, specific pages are appended or merged, then the output is written to a file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Uses deprecated library 'PyPDF3' but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard PDF merging operations with straightforward file handling. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The only concern is the use of a deprecated library, which is a maintenance issue but not a security threat. No anomalous data flows or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign PDF merging utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0 given the lack of vulnerabilities. Slightly elevated risk scores in some reports (0.1-0.2) due to library deprecation are justifiable but not necessary. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy.",
