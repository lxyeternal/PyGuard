  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate PDF processing script with embedded JavaScript for automation and static credentials. While these features could be misused if the PDF is distributed maliciously, there is no active malicious behavior or sabotage detected. The malware score should be set at 0.2 to reflect potential misuse of JavaScript, and the overall security risk is moderate but justified. The code is not obfuscated, and no malicious intent is evident."
