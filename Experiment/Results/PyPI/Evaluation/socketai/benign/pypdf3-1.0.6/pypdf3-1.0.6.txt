      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate PDF processing script with embedded JavaScript for automation and static credentials. While these features could be misused if the PDF is distributed maliciously, there is no active malicious behavior or sabotage detected. The malware score should be set at 0.2 to reflect potential misuse of JavaScript, and the overall security risk is moderate but justified. The code is not obfuscated, and no malicious intent is evident."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign PDF merging utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0 given the lack of vulnerabilities. Slightly elevated risk scores in some reports (0.1-0.2) due to library deprecation are justifiable but not necessary. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy."
