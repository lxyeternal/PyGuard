  "purpose": "Implementation of stream filters for PDF decoding, including decompression, predictor algorithms, and various encoding schemes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from in-memory stream objects, stream filters, and decode parameters within PDF stream objects.",
  "sinks": "Processes data internally; no external sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from compressed or encoded form through decoding functions, potentially involving predictor adjustments, back to raw data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Fallback mechanisms for IronPython are standard for cross-platform support.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard PDF stream decoding routines, including zlib decompression, PNG prediction filters, TIFF headers, and other encoding schemes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The fallback for IronPython uses typical .NET libraries, which is standard practice. The code handles untrusted data but does not perform external system calls or network operations. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), consistent with the purpose of data decoding utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of PDF stream filters with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate given its function. All reports' assessments are accurate; no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
