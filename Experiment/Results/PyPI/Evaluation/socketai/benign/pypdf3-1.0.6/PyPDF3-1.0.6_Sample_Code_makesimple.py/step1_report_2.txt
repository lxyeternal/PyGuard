  "purpose": "Generate multi-page PDF files with sample text content.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from command line arguments, predefined list 'nps' in main.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations to create PDF files on disk.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (np) from the loop determine number of pages; data flows from function inputs to file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No use of insecure environment variables or dynamic code execution. The script performs simple PDF generation with no external network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and uses 'reportlab' for PDF creation. It defines a function to create multi-page PDFs with sample text. The main block iterates over a predefined list to generate files named 'simple0.pdf', 'simple1.pdf', etc. All operations are straightforward file I/O and text rendering with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign PDF generator with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The code's structure and behavior are consistent with its purpose as a simple PDF creation utility.",
