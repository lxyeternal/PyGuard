{
  "purpose": "Generate multi-page PDF files with simple text content using the reportlab library.",
  "sources": "Input filename parameters from the loop and command line arguments (though command line args are not actively used in current code).",
  "sinks": "The code writes PDF files to the filesystem; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Loop over predefined page counts, generate PDFs, and write output files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily uses reportlab to generate PDF files with static content. It reads filename parameters from a list and formats page content accordingly. No input from untrusted sources, network connections, or environment variables are used. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data theft, network activity, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely to generate sample PDF files and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious intent.",
