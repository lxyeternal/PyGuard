{
  "purpose": "Generate multi-page PDF files with sample text content.",
  "sources": "Input from command line arguments (argv), static variables (TEXT), loop variables.",
  "sinks": "File writing via reportlab.pdfgen.canvas (save), printing output to stdout.",
  "flows": "Main loop creates filenames, calls make_pdf_file which writes PDF content to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines a function to generate PDF files with multiple pages containing sample text, and runs this function for predefined sizes, writing PDFs to disk. It only generates PDFs locally and prints filenames. No user input or external data sources are used that could be exploited. There are no network connections, code injections, or backdoors. The code is straightforward, with clear logic for PDF creation, and no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign PDF generator script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely creates PDF files locally with static content. No malware or malicious intent detected.",
