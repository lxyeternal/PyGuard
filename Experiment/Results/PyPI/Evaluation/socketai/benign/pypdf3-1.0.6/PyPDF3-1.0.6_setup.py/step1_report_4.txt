  "purpose": "Setup script for the PyPDF3 library, defining its metadata and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from 'PyPDF3/_version.py' file; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Reads version string from file, then passes metadata to setup(), no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'distutils' (deprecated), but this is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a version string from a local file using regex, then calls setup() with package metadata. It does not process user input, network data, or execute any code that could be malicious. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious actions are present. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging the library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
