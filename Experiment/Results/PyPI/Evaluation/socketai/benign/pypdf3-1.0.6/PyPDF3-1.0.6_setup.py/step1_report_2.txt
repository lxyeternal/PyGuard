  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the PyPDF3 library, including reading version info and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version string from 'PyPDF3/_version.py' file",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data output or external system effects",
  "flows": "Reading version from file -> setup configuration, no external data flow beyond file I/O",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; standard setup process, no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The script reads a version string from a local file, then uses this data to configure package metadata via setuptools. It imports 're' for regex parsing, which is standard, and does not execute any untrusted or external data. No malicious behavior or suspicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only performs file reading and package configuration, which are typical for such scripts.",
