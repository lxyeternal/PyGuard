{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python package setup script that reads version information from a local file and configures package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from 'PyPDF3/_version.py' using regex.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local file -> passes metadata to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package setup without obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical package configuration: it reads a version string from a local file using regex, then calls setup() with package metadata. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The use of distutils is deprecated but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. All signals indicate benign, standard behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It poses no supply chain threat or security concern.",
