  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a typical Python package setup script.\n- Reads version info from a local file `PyPDF3/_version.py` using regex.\n- Uses `distutils.core.setup()` to configure package metadata.\n- No external or untrusted data inputs beyond reading a local version file.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code segments.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of code that reads a version string from a file**: This is standard practice, not malicious.\n- **Use of `distutils` instead of `setuptools`**: Outdated but not malicious.\n- **No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks**.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Use of `distutils`**: Deprecated, but not a security concern. It may be a maintenance issue but not a security risk.\n- **No validation of the version file content** beyond regex matching: Slightly fragile but not malicious.\n- **No dynamic code execution or external inputs**: The script is static and safe.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is accurate. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0 or close to it, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- Since the code performs standard package setup tasks without any suspicious behavior, a **malware score of 0** is justified.\n- The code is not obfuscated, so **obfuscated score of 0** is correct.\n- The overall security risk is negligible; thus, a **risk score of 0** or very close to it is appropriate.\n\n### Potential Inconsistencies:\n- The only minor inconsistency is the confidence level in report 4, which is 0.9, slightly below 1, but given the straightforward nature, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, non-malicious setup script. It reads version info from a local file, uses common modules, and performs no suspicious operations. There are no signs of supply chain attacks, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this script. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary. The code poses no security threat and is typical for package configuration.",
