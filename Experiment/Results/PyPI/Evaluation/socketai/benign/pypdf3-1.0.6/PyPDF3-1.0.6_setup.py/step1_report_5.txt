{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up a Python package named PyPDF3, including reading version information and specifying package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading version string from 'PyPDF3/_version.py' file; importing modules 'distutils.core' and 're'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is directly written or executed in a malicious manner.",
  "flows": "Version string is read from the file and used in setup; no untrusted data flows to potentially dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code reads version info from an external file but does not validate the content beyond regex matching. No obfuscated or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations for a Python package, including reading a version string via regex. It uses 'distutils' for setup, which is common. No external inputs are processed dynamically or insecurely. The only file I/O is reading version info, which appears benign. No code injection, malicious network activity, or suspicious behavior identified. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It reads version info securely, specifies package metadata, and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
