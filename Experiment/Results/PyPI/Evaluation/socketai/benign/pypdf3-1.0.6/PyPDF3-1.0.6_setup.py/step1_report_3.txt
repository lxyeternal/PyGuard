{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the PyPDF3 library, including metadata and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from 'PyPDF3/_version.py' file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects; only reads a local file for version info.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from file; no flow to external systems or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'distutils' instead of 'setuptools', which is outdated but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup procedure: reading the version string via regex from a local file, then passing metadata to 'setup()'. No external network activity, data leaks, or suspicious code are present. The only notable aspect is reliance on 'distutils', which is deprecated but not malicious. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a typical packaging script for a Python library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It properly reads version info from a local file and prepares package metadata. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
