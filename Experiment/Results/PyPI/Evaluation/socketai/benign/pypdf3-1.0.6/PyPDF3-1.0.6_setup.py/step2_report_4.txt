  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The script reads version info from a local file and performs standard setup operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0. This aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard package setup with no external data processing or suspicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0. Correct, as the code is straightforward.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Uses 'distutils' (deprecated but not malicious), reads version info from a local file, no external or untrusted data.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0. The deprecation note is not a security concern; the code remains benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, reads version info, no malicious behavior.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0. The analysis is consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; straightforward package setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None of the reports identify any malicious activity. The code is purely for package setup, reading version info from a local file, and calling `setup()`.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code segments are present; all code is clear and standard.\n- **Security Risks:** The code does not process untrusted input, execute external commands, or perform any network operations. The only file I/O is reading a version string, which is safe.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:** The reports correctly identify that the script is standard and benign. There are no assumptions that lead to false positives.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (consistent across all reports and justified)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall, the code is a typical, benign setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.**",
