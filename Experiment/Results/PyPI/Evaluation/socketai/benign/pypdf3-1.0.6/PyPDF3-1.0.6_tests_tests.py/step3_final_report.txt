{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for PDF processing, including text extraction, image extraction, font handling, and embedding JavaScript for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads PDF files from resource directory, loads files into PdfFileReader, extracts text and images, and embeds JavaScript via addJS().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; embedded JavaScript is for testing, not malicious activity; no network or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Source files are read into PdfFileReader; text and images are extracted; JavaScript is embedded via addJS() and stored in PDF catalog; no external or malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs controlled PDF reading, extraction, and JavaScript embedding within a testing context. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or network activity are present. JavaScript snippets are benign and used for testing purposes. The use of temporary files and resource files is standard and safe. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for PDF functionalities with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The embedded JavaScript is controlled and typical for testing. Scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
