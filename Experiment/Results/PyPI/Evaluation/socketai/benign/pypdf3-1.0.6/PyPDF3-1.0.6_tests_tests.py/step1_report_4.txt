{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for testing PDF file reading, image extraction, font handling, and adding JavaScript to PDFs.",
  "sources": "File reads from RESOURCE_ROOT directory for PDF files and text extraction. No external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leakage, system modification, or network transmission. The code manipulates PDFs locally without network activity or system commands.",
  "flows": "Reads PDF files -> Extracts content or images -> Writes PDFs with embedded JavaScript in memory. No untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'addJS' could embed JavaScript in PDFs, which is common but potentially malicious if used improperly. No evidence of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code performs PDF reading, text and image extraction, and appending JavaScript for printing. The test files are loaded locally from a resource directory. The only dynamic code modification involves adding JavaScript to PDFs, which is a standard feature but can be misused if the PDF is shared maliciously. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious payloads. The JavaScript injection is controlled within test cases and does not seem malicious. Overall, the code appears to be standard testing code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is for testing PDF processing functions, including text extraction, image extraction, font handling, and adding JavaScript. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks identified. The use of addJS could embed scripts, but in this context, it is within a testing framework. No signs of malware or malicious activity are present.",
