  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the reasonableness of their risk scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a URI/IRI parsing library based on RFC standards.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of data leakage, system commands, or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a well-structured, RFC-compliant URI parser with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 — Slightly above zero, perhaps due to general caution, but no real risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard regex patterns, parsing, and pattern compilation.\n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- The command-line interface only outputs pattern data.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 — Very low, appropriate for a benign utility.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on pattern definitions, matching, parsing, and command-line pattern display.\n- No signs of malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- The code is a straightforward URI parser.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.0 — Fully justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing safe pattern matching and URI handling.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code.\n- Command-line output is benign.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 — Slightly above zero, but still minimal.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Again, a pattern definition and URI handling library.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external system influence.\n- The code is standard and safe.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.0 — Fully justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. I concur with a malware score of **0** for the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear, with no obfuscation techniques. I agree with **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1–0.2), justified by the fact that this is a URI parsing library—potentially misused if untrusted data is passed, but inherently safe. I would assign a **risk score of around 0.1** to **0.2**, consistent with the reports.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores for the code:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.1**\n\nThis reflects a benign, RFC-compliant URI/IRI parsing library with no malicious or obfuscated code, and minimal inherent security risk when used properly.",
