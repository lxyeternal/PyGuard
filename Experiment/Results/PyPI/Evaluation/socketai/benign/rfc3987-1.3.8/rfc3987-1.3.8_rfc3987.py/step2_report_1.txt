  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for signs of malicious activity, and assess the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a standard RFC-compliant URI/IRI parser with no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. It emphasizes that the regex patterns are standard and that the functions are for parsing, validation, composition, and resolution. The confidence score is high (0.9), and malware/security risk scores are low (0.2 and 0.1).\n\n- **Code Check:** The code is a well-structured library focused on regex-based URI/IRI handling. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious patterns are present. The only \"anomalies\" are the extensive regex patterns, which are standard for such libraries.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No malware or malicious behavior detected. The low security risk aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a utility for parsing and validating URIs/IRIs, with no malicious activity. Confidence is very high (0.95), malware score is 0, and security risk is minimal (0.1).\n\n- **Code Check:** Same as above; no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The command-line interface only outputs pattern data.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a standard URI/IRI parser with no signs of malware.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a utility for URI/IRI handling with no malicious behavior. Confidence is perfect (1.0), malware is 0, and security risk is 0.\n\n- **Code Check:** Same observations; no malicious activity, code injection, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe and standard.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The same pattern—standard URI/IRI parsing utility with no malicious intent. Confidence is high (0.95), malware is 0, and security risk is low (0.2).\n\n- **Code Check:** No malicious code, no network activity, no system commands, just pattern matching and string handling.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is a standard regex-based URI/IRI parser with no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no malicious data handling. Confidence is perfect (1.0), malware is 0, and security risk is 0.\n\n- **Code Check:** Same as previous; no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the code as a standard, RFC-compliant URI/IRI parsing library with no malicious features.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They do not overstate the security posture; they acknowledge the code's purpose and lack of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores justification:**  \n  The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code or behavior. The security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions?**  \n  The only \"risk\" is that the code could be misused if untrusted inputs are passed into functions—standard for URI parsers—but this is inherent and not malicious.\n\n- **Obfuscation and malware scores:**  \n  All reports correctly identify obfuscation and malware as zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Overall malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to potential misuse of URI parsing, but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, RFC-compliant URI/IRI parsing library with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to account for potential misuse, but not a security issue)\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe and suitable for supply chain inclusion.",
