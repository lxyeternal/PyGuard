{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and regular expressions for parsing, validating, composing, and resolving URIs and IRIs according to RFC 3986 and RFC 3987 standards.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input strings provided to functions like parse() and match(), and from command-line arguments in the main block.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions that generate output (print statements), but there are no evident sinks that send data over networks, write files, or invoke system commands with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input strings from parameters flow into parse() and match() functions, which use regex patterns to process the data. There are no dangerous flows involving untrusted data leading to harmful actions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is largely standard for URI parsing with no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic execution. The main block simply prints pattern info or handles command-line args without executing external commands or code. No backdoors or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines regex patterns for RFC-compliant URI/IRI components, and provides functions for pattern compilation, matching, parsing, composing, and resolving URIs. The patterns are meticulously crafted, with provisions for unicode and BMP constraints, but they are for standard URI processing. The main execution block offers pattern inspection via command-line args. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, code injection, or backdoors. Overall, the code appears a well-structured URI parser utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, well-documented URI/IRI parsing library that contains no malicious or sabotage code. It provides useful utilities for handling URIs securely and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
