{
  "purpose": "The code provides RFC-compliant URI and IRI parsing, validation, composition, and resolution utilities using regex patterns. It is designed for handling URI/IRI strings according to RFC standards.",
  "sources": "Input strings for parsing, validation, and resolution functions; command-line arguments for pattern display.",
  "sinks": "No system calls, network activity, or data leaks; data flows are limited to regex matching and string processing.",
  "flows": "Input strings are matched or parsed via regex patterns; parsed components are used for composition or resolution; no external or malicious sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected. Regex patterns are complex but standard for URI validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, RFC-compliant URI/IRI parser library utilizing regex patterns for validation, parsing, composition, and resolution. It does not perform any network, system, or malicious operations. The regex patterns are extensive but standard for URI handling. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. The command-line interface only outputs pattern data, which is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, RFC-compliant URI/IRI parsing utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It is safe for supply chain use, with minimal inherent security risk due to potential misuse of untrusted input, which is typical for such libraries.",
