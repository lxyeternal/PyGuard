{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'rfc3987' Python package, used for package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from setuptools/distutils, and rfc3987.__doc__, rfc3987.__version__",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is used in critical operations or output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from sources to sinks that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code. The code straightforwardly loads metadata and calls setup().",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import 'setuptools' and falls back to 'distutils.core' if not available. It then imports 'rfc3987' and extracts its docstring to generate description fields. The setup() function is called with metadata, including author info, URLs, and package details. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used, and there are no suspicious code constructs or obfuscated elements. The code is standard for a Python package setup script, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging the 'rfc3987' library. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It simply defines package metadata for distribution.",
