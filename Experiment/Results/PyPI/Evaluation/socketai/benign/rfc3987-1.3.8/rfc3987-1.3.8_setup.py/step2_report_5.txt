  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup.py for rfc3987, importing the module, extracting __doc__ and __version__, and passing these to setup().\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no external data handling, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, notes the unconventional use of __doc__ for description but finds no malicious intent.\n- **Findings:** No external data or malicious code; use of __doc__ is benign.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** Static data, no untrusted data handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard package setup with no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no external data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard setup script with no malicious signs.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence:** The code is straightforward, standard for Python packaging.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no obfuscated code, no external system calls, no external data leaks.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the absence of security issues.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, given the lack of any security concerns.\n\n**In conclusion**, the reports are consistent and accurate. The setup script is benign, with no signs of supply chain risks or malicious activity.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
