  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no external data handling, straightforward package setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, standard setup script.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious behavior, unconventional use of __doc__, but harmless.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5. Given the lack of malicious activity but noting the unconventional pattern, a risk score of 0.5 might be slightly high but still acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard setup script, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5. Consistent with prior assessments.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical setup script with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious code or behavior. The code only reads static module attributes and performs package setup. **Final malware score: 0.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, straightforward, with no obfuscation patterns. The use of `__doc__` and `__dict__` is unconventional but benign. **Final obfuscated score: 0.**\n\n- **Risk Score:** The only point to consider is the risk score of 0.5 assigned in some reports. Since the code is purely for package setup, with no external data, no code injection, and no malicious activity, the risk should be minimal. However, since the code relies on package attributes and could, in theory, be manipulated if the package's `__doc__` or `__version__` were maliciously altered, a very cautious approach might assign a low but non-zero risk. Given the evidence, I would set the risk score to **0**.\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0** |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this with zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
