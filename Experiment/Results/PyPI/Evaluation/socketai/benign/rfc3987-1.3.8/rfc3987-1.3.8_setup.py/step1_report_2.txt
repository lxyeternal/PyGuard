  "purpose": "This script defines the setup configuration for the 'rfc3987' Python package, specifying metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'setuptools' or 'distutils.core'; attributes from 'rfc3987' such as '__doc__' and '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no execution of untrusted data or external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup configuration data is static and sourced from package attributes.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'rfc3987.__doc__' for parsing description strings is unconventional but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import setup from 'setuptools', falling back to 'distutils.core' if unavailable. It then accesses 'rfc3987.__doc__' to extract description strings, which is a standard pattern for package metadata. The setup() call is a typical distribution configuration with static data and no user input handling. There are no indications of malicious code, external data fetching, or obfuscated behavior. The only minor concern is the unconventional use of the package's own __doc__ string for description data, which is harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or external data leaks.",
