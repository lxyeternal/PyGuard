  "purpose": "Setup script for the rfc3987 Python package, defining package metadata and installation configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports the rfc3987 module and reads its __doc__ and __version__ attributes.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Imports rfc3987's documentation and version, then uses these to populate setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of rfc3987.__doc__ and __dict__ for string formatting is unconventional but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import 'setuptools' and falls back to 'distutils' if unavailable, a common pattern. It imports rfc3987 and extracts its documentation string and version information for setup configuration. The setup() call uses these attributes to define package metadata, including name, description, long description, author details, URLs, license, classifiers, and keywords. No suspicious or malicious behavior, external data handling, or code injection is observed. The code is straightforward and adheres typical packaging standards.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses package metadata from rfc3987 for setup parameters without any suspicious code patterns.",
