{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the Python package 'rfc3987' for distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools/distutils, rfc3987 module documentation, rfc3987.__version__, rfc3987.__dict__",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; setup configuration uses static data and module attributes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with proper module attributes; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The script imports the setup function from setuptools or distutils, then imports the rfc3987 module. It extracts the module's docstring and version for use in setup parameters. All values used are static or derived from the module's attributes. There is no code execution beyond static data handling, no input/output processing, and no network or system calls that could be malicious. The structure follows a typical setup.py pattern, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely configures package metadata for distribution, with no suspicious activity.",
