{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging the rfc3987 Python library, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's __doc__ string and __version__ attribute for description and version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks are present; the code does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The static data from the module's attributes flows into the setup() function to define package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional use of __doc__ for description, but this is benign and does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script that imports package metadata and passes it to setuptools or distutils. It contains no external data handling, user input, or dynamic code execution. The use of module attributes is static and safe. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward, benign package setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and overall risk are accurate and should be maintained.",
