{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python class and associated configuration for managing 'API access keys' for the 'New Relic' provider within a Terraform CDK context, enabling infrastructure as code management of API keys.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from constructor parameters such as 'account_id', 'key_type', 'id', 'ingest_type', 'name', 'notes', 'user_id', and optional provider and connection settings.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data could flow from input parameters directly into resource configurations, but there are no evident sinks that exfiltrate data or execute harmful commands. No explicit data leakage or command execution is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through class properties into resource definitions, with no evidence of untrusted data being used insecurely or reaching dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation. The code structure appears standard for Terraform CDK resource definitions. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly adheres to defining a resource class with properties, constructor, and configuration structures for managing API keys in a Terraform CDK context. It includes type checks, resource import functionality, and reset methods, all consistent with typical infrastructure as code patterns. There is no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, reverse shells, or other malicious behavior. The initial import of 'pkgutil' and 'publication' are benign or related to package management. No suspicious network activity or system manipulation is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard infrastructure as code resource class for managing API keys with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured module for resource management without malicious behavior.",
