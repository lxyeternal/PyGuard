{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Terraform resource class for managing New Relic API access keys via CDKTF, handling configuration parameters, import, and property management.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, class properties, and internal attribute storage",
  "sinks": "Property setters and internal attribute assignments; no external data sinks or network activity",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class attributes and configuration data structures; no external or untrusted data flows detected",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated resource class employing typical patterns: type validation, property getters/setters, import functions, and configuration data classes. It uses well-known libraries and does not contain network calls, dynamic code execution, or malicious logic. All signals point to benign, infrastructure-as-code resource management code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, benign, and aligns with standard practices for resource definitions in Terraform CDK. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.",
