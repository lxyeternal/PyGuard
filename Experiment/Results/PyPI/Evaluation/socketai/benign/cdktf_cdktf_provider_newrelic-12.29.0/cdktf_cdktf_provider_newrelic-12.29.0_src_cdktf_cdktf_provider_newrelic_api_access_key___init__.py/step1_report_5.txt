{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and data structures for managing API access keys for the New Relic provider within a Terraform CDK (Cloud Development Kit) setup. It primarily provides resource configuration, import functions, and property setters/getters.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters (e.g., scope, id, account_id, key_type, etc.), and from internal attributes such as '_values' and properties via jsii.get() calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include setting resource attributes (e.g., accountId, keyType, id, name, notes, userId) which could be misused if manipulated with untrusted data, but in this context, they are standard configuration points. No direct data leak or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into resource configuration objects; these are then used in resource creation. There are no network calls, data exfiltration, or code execution flows in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to be auto-generated boilerplate for infrastructure as code resource definitions. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variable names are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical infrastructure-as-code resource class definition using jsii and CDK constructs. It includes type hints, property setters/getters, resource import functions, and resource configuration data structures. It relies on external libraries and does not perform any runtime logic beyond property management. No indications of malicious activity such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors are present. It appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation for resource management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard resource definition module for managing New Relic API access keys within Terraform CDK. It contains no malicious behavior, no hidden backdoors, nor any suspicious logic. It is consistent with infrastructure configuration patterns and appears safe.",
