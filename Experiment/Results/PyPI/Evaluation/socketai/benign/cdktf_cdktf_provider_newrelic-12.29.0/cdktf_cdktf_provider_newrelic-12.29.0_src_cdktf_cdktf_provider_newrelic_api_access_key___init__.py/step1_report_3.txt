{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python class and associated data structures for managing a 'New Relic API Access Key' resource within a Terraform CDK framework, including methods for creation, import, and attribute management.",
  "sources": "Data sources include constructor parameters, environment variables indirectly (via dependencies and provider), and static definitions within class and function signatures.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the methods that set resource attributes (e.g., account_id, key_type, id, etc.), which could accept untrusted input, and import functions that may process external identifiers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters and import functions to attribute setters, which ultimately influence resource configuration. No untrusted external data appears to be processed insecurely or injected into execution contexts.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or misleading variable names are present. The code appears standard for a resource definition in a Terraform CDK context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical CDKTF resource class with associated configuration data types. It uses type hints and validation functions, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. The structure is consistent with generated resource classes, with no suspicious logic. All data flows are within expected boundaries for resource configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, legitimate resource class for managing a New Relic API access key within Terraform CDK. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior, nor does it exhibit security vulnerabilities. The code is well-structured and follows common patterns for infrastructure-as-code definitions.",
