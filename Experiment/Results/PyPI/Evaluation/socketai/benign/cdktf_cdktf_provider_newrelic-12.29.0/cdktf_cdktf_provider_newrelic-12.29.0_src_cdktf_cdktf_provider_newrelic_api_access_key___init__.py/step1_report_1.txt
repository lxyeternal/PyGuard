{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for managing and importing API access keys for the 'newrelic' Terraform provider, including resource configuration, property management, and type checking.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters, class attributes, and type annotations within the class constructors and methods.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are evident; however, the code involves the creation and configuration of Terraform resources which may interact with external systems like cloud providers or APIs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., account_id, key_type) flow through class initializers and setters, influencing resource configuration; type checking functions validate input data; resource import and reset functions modify resource state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are observed. The code uses standard libraries, conventions, and SDKs for infrastructure as code management. No signs of obfuscation, malicious data handling, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical SDK or framework-based implementation for defining and managing Terraform resources, specifically for New Relic API access keys. It employs type checking, resource configuration, and import capabilities in a standard manner. There are no embedded network calls, file manipulations, or dynamic code executions indicating malicious intent. The functions and classes follow predictable patterns aligned with infrastructure as code best practices. Overall, the code is consistent with legitimate SDK or auto-generated resource management modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate resource definition for managing New Relic API access keys within Terraform CDK. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It functions as a structured interface for resource configuration and import, using standard libraries and patterns.",
