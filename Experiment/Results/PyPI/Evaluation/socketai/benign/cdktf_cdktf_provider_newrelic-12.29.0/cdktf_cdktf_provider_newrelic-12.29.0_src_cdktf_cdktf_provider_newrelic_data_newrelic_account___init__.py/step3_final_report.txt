{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Terraform data source class for retrieving a New Relic account, managing input parameters and resource configuration within the CDKTF framework.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, package metadata (typeguard version), and internal class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Class properties and methods that set or get attribute values; no external data transmission or output.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class attributes; class instantiation via jsii.create; property setters update internal state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network calls, no external data exfiltration, and no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, generated or framework-based implementation for managing a Terraform data source in Python. It uses typical patterns such as class inheritance, property management, and jsii integration. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The package metadata access and extend_path usage are common and benign. The code does not perform any external communication, data leaks, or execute untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of a Terraform data source class for New Relic accounts. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is 0, consistent with the detailed analysis.",
