  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual content, data flows, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code manages a Terraform data source for New Relic accounts, with input via constructor parameters and class attributes. It notes the package metadata access (typeguard version), which is benign.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The data flows are standard—parameters into class attributes, with no external data transmission or code execution. The only sinks are setting class properties, which are safe.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or obfuscated code detected. The extend_path usage is a normal package extension pattern.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a standard, auto-generated infrastructure module. No signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly describes the class as a Terraform data source, with input via parameters and class properties.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The use of jsii.create and jsii.set are standard for CDK constructs; no external system calls or data leaks are evident.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of jsii and type checks are typical.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, non-malicious code for resource configuration.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—class for Terraform data source, input via constructor args, environment metadata.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network activity; data flows are internal.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no external communication.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate infrastructure code.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the class as a data source for New Relic accounts.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transmission, no command execution, only internal property management.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe resource class.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others—standard resource class, input via parameters.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data flows, no network or file operations.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate code.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None. The code is a typical, auto-generated or framework-based resource class for Terraform CDK, managing configuration data with standard patterns.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nGiven the detailed review, the code is a standard implementation for a Terraform data source in Python, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The data flows are typical for infrastructure as code modules, and there are no external network calls, file manipulations, or secret exfiltration mechanisms.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate, and does not pose any security threat.",
