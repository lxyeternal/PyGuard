  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a generated SDK class for a Terraform data source for New Relic key transactions. It performs input validation, property access, and resource management via jsii, with no external network activity or malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as boilerplate for resource configuration, with no signs of malicious activity. The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) seem appropriate given the lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The low security risk score (0.1) is acceptable considering the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the resource configuration for a New Relic key transaction. No malicious activity or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's nature. The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are reasonable.\n\n- **Verdict:** No concerns. The code is standard infrastructure code with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the resource definition and configuration, again standard for CDKTF data sources. No external or malicious activity is observed.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion that this is legitimate IaC code with no malware or security risks is correct. The scores are appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the code's purpose as a Terraform data source with no signs of malicious behavior. The dynamic type checking is standard for compatibility.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly dismisses any security concern, and the scores reflect that.\n\n- **Verdict:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes the class manages Terraform data sources, with potential \"dangerous sinks\" in resource creation and import functions, but finds no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n- **Assessment:** While the report mentions potential risks in resource management functions, these are standard patterns in IaC tooling. No external network activity, credential handling, or malicious code is present.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 — consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior?** No. All reports agree that the code is boilerplate for resource configuration, with no network activity, credential handling, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Obfuscation or hidden malicious code?** No. The code is straightforward, with standard patterns and no suspicious constructs.\n\n- **Scores justification:** The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified. The obfuscated score of 0 is correct. The risk scores are very low, reflecting the code's purpose as infrastructure configuration code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 — very low, primarily due to the nature of infrastructure code, which could be misused if modified maliciously, but no such evidence exists here.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, auto-generated SDK class for managing a Terraform data source in CDKTF. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for potential misuse if altered, but currently very safe)\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more conservative or aggressive scoring approach.",
