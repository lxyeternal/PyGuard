{
  "purpose": "Defines a Terraform data source for retrieving New Relic key transaction information via CDK for Terraform (CDKTF).",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters such as 'name', 'account_id', 'guid', 'id', and optional provider/provisioner settings. Imports modules for type checking, jsii, cdktf, constructs, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters like 'name', 'account_id', 'guid', 'id' flow into the constructor and configuration objects. No data flows to external sinks; the code mainly constructs configuration data for Terraform.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code utilizes standard constructs for defining infrastructure resources. The presence of type checking and import functions appears typical for CDKTF-generated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a CDKTF data source in Python, including class definitions, constructor, and type checking stubs. It imports necessary modules, performs input validation, and defines resource configuration structures. No evidence of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, system modification, or backdoors, is present. The code's purpose is to facilitate infrastructure as code for monitoring in New Relic, which is consistent with legitimate use. All functions and class structures follow typical patterns for CDKTF resource definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate infrastructure as code construct for interfacing with New Relic via Terraform and CDKTF. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears safe and intended for resource data retrieval.",
