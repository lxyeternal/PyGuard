  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Describes a class wrapping a Terraform data source for New Relic key transactions.\n- **Sources & Flows:** Reads input parameters, passes configuration to JSII, no external data leaks or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Standard SDK boilerplate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate SDK code, no malware or security risks.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1 (low)\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature—standard resource class, no malicious signals.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines a Terraform data source for New Relic key transaction.\n- **Sources & Flows:** Reads parameters, no evidence of data exfiltration or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. Standard infrastructure code.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies the code as typical infrastructure code, no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above—Terraform data source for New Relic key transaction.\n- **Sources & Flows:** Reads configuration, no external or untrusted data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious indicators, standard pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n- **Confidence:** 1, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The code is standard and safe; the report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar resource class, with focus on configuration and type checking.\n- **Sources & Flows:** No external data leaks or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no secrets, standard use of type checking.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard IaC code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The code is typical for CDKTF resource definitions, no malicious signals.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Manages a Terraform data source for New Relic key transactions.\n- **Sources & Flows:** Reads parameters, no external network or data exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Uses standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, non-malicious code.\n- **Confidence:** 1, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The code is standard resource management code, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports describe standard SDK/CDK code for Terraform resource management.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws identified.\n- **Scores consistency:** All scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: very low) are consistent with the code content.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected; the code is boilerplate for infrastructure as code.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The reports avoid assumptions and focus on code analysis, correctly identifying the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores justification:** The risk scores are appropriately low, given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The code is standard for a CDKTF resource class, generated or written for infrastructure management.  \n- No external communication, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.  \n- The type checking and import functions are typical for maintaining compatibility and safety.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, legitimate infrastructure code with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and reasonable.",
