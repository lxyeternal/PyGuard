{
  "purpose": "Defines a Terraform data source for retrieving a specific New Relic key transaction based on its name or GUID, used for infrastructure as code management.",
  "sources": "Reads data from imported modules, environment, and user-provided parameters (name, account_id, guid, id).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; the code mainly initializes data structures and calls SDK methods.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the class constructors and configuration data, which are then used by the jsii framework to generate or import Terraform resources. No data is observed flowing into untrusted sinks or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code imports modules that are standard for CDK for Terraform and Terraform provider interactions. No suspicious code patterns, such as dynamic execution or hidden backdoors, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for a Terraform data source resource using jsii, with typical constructor and property methods. It includes type checking and configuration management but does not perform any network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No malicious behaviors such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoor mechanisms are evident. The presence of functions for type checking and resource configuration aligns with standard IaC practices.",
  "conclusion": "The source code appears to be legitimate infrastructure as code (IaC) definitions for managing New Relic key transactions with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It functions as part of a Terraform provider wrapper, with no suspicious behavior observed.",
