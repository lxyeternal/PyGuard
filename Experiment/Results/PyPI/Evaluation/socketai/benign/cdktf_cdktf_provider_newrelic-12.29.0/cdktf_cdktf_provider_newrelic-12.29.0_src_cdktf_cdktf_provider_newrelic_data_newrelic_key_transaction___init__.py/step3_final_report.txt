{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python class representing a Terraform data source for New Relic key transactions, used within the CDKTF framework to manage infrastructure configurations.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as name, account_id, guid, id; accesses properties via jsii; performs type checking; manages resource configuration and import functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration points are present; the code is purely for resource configuration.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class properties; configuration is passed to jsii for resource management; no external or untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors; standard SDK boilerplate and type checking functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK class for managing a Terraform data source via CDKTF. It performs input validation, property access, and resource import/export functions without any network activity or malicious logic. The absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns indicates a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are consistent with the code's nature as infrastructure-as-code boilerplate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and intended for infrastructure management. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current scoring accurately reflects its benign, standard SDK role.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
