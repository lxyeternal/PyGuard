  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Analysis:**\n   - The code appears to be an auto-generated or manually crafted set of Python classes and data structures for managing a Terraform resource related to \"newrelic_workload\".\n   - It uses the `jsii` framework for interoperability, indicating it's part of a CDK (Cloud Development Kit) construct library.\n   - The classes include resource definitions (`Workload`), configuration data classes (`WorkloadConfig`, `WorkloadStatusConfigAutomatic`, etc.), and complex list/output reference classes for nested structures.\n   - The code contains extensive type checking via `check_type` functions, which are stubbed out at the bottom.\n   - The resource and nested configurations seem comprehensive, covering various properties, including search queries, status configurations, rollups, thresholds, etc.\n\n2. **Security & Malware Considerations:**\n   - The code itself is mostly boilerplate for resource modeling; no executable logic, external code execution, or malicious patterns are present.\n   - The presence of `jsii` and complex data classes is typical for infrastructure-as-code libraries.\n   - There are no signs of embedded malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or system calls beyond what is typical for resource definitions.\n\n3. **Report Summary:**\n   - All reports are \"Empty response\" with no actual report content provided.\n   - No specific issues, errors, or suspicious findings are described in the reports.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - Since no actual issues are reported, the malware score should be **0**.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be **0**, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The risk score, reflecting potential security impact, should be **0** unless there's an underlying vulnerability or malicious intent, which isn't evident here.\n\n5. **Logical & Reasoning Checks:**\n   - The code's logic appears consistent with typical CDK resource classes.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is declarative and boilerplate.\n   - No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present.\n\n6. **Final Recommendations:**\n   - The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk) should all be **0**.\n   - The reports lack content, so no further analysis is possible or necessary.\n   - The code appears safe and legitimate for its purpose.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis assessment is based on the provided code and the absence of any suspicious activity or embedded malicious patterns.",
