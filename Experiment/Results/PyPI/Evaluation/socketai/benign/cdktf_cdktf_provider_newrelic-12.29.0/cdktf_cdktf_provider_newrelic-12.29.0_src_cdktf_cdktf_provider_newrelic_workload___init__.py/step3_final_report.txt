  "review": "The provided code is a comprehensive, boilerplate SDK for managing a Terraform resource related to 'newrelic_workload'. It uses jsii for interoperability and defines resource classes, configuration data structures, and nested complex list classes. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward, declarative, and typical for infrastructure-as-code SDKs. The reports are empty and contain no evidence of issues. Therefore, the overall security and malware risk scores are zero, and the code is deemed safe and legitimate for its purpose.",
