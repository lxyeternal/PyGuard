{
  "purpose": "This code defines a data source for retrieving New Relic notification destination details using Terraform CDK (Cloud Development Kit) constructs, including classes for resource configuration and attribute management.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration input parameters such as account_id, id, name, secure_url, and various connection and lifecycle settings during object initialization and attribute accessors.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially flow through the input parameters like 'secure_url' and 'connection' if they are supplied externally, but the code itself does not perform any insecure operations or external communications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters during class instantiation into internal state, with attributes accessible via properties. No external or network interactions are present; data is confined within class methods and attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a standard implementation of a CDK data source with type checking, class definitions, and resource configuration. No obfuscation, malicious function calls, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for managing Terraform data source configurations, with type-safe property accessors and initializers. It uses type hints, runtime type checks, and standard resource attribute management. No network activity, external data leaks, or malicious code constructs are detected. The functions serve to enforce type correctness and manage resource attributes in a typical infrastructure-as-code pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, structured, and typical of a Terraform CDK data source implementation. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks based on its static analysis. It functions solely as a resource configuration helper with no evident security threats.",
