  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim:** The code is a boilerplate SDK-generated resource for querying New Relic notification destinations via CDKTF. No malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a standard, generated SDK with no signs of malware or security risks.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate; obfuscated score of 0 is correct; security risk is negligible.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, reasonable, and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim:** The code is a typical Terraform CDK data source, with no external or malicious data flows. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes that data flows are confined within class properties and methods, with no external communications or malicious logic.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate; obfuscated score of 0; security risk is minimal.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim:** Similar to above, the code is standard for resource configuration, with potential data leakage points limited to properties like 'secure_url'. No malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The detailed reasoning confirms that the code is purely configuration-focused, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is correct; obfuscated score of 0; security risk is negligible.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim:** The code is an SDK component for managing data sources, with no external data leaks or malicious behavior. It is typical infrastructure code.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly emphasizes the absence of network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0; obfuscated score of 0; security risk of 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim:** The code is a standard SDK module for Terraform data sources, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's structure and purpose, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0; obfuscated score of 0; security risk of 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, assigning a score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward SDK/generated code, obfuscation score of 0.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the nature of the code—configuration classes, type checks, resource definitions—there's no security risk or vulnerability present.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nBased on the static analysis, the code is a standard, SDK-generated infrastructure-as-code component with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe within its intended scope.",
