{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions for interacting with the Terraform data source for New Relic notification destinations, primarily for infrastructure as code management using CDKTF.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, class properties, and type hints. It also accesses module imports such as jsii, publication, typeguard, and various Terraform provider modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any obvious sinks that process untrusted data into system effects or external communications, such as network connections, file writes, or command executions.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves initializing data classes with user-provided configuration, type-checking inputs, and creating JSII objects to interface with Terraform resources. There are no source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are detected. The functions perform standard type-checking and object creation for Terraform resource management. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions, data structures, and type validation functions, all aligned with managing Terraform data sources through CDKTF. The typeguard usage and class properties are typical for such SDKs. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration. The module appears to be a standard part of an infrastructure SDK with no malicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured SDK module for managing Terraform data sources related to New Relic notification destinations. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior and poses no security risk. The code performs type validation, class instantiation, and resource referencing without any suspicious activities.",
