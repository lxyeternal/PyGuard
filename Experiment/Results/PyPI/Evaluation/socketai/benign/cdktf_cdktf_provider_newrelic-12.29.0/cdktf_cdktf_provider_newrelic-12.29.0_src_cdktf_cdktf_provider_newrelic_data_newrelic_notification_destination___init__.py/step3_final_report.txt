{
  "purpose": "Generated SDK classes for querying and managing New Relic notification destinations via Terraform CDK, focusing on resource data access and configuration.",
  "sources": "Class initializers, property getters/setters, type checks, and resource interaction methods; no external data input beyond configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Internal class attributes, resource configuration data, and property outputs; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class properties and methods; no external data exfiltration or malicious data processing detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; code is standard SDK-generated infrastructure code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard generated classes for Terraform data sources, with typical type validation, resource configuration, and property management. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external communication are present. The structure aligns with SDK patterns, and no suspicious patterns or secrets are embedded.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, SDK-generated interface for Terraform to access New Relic notification destination data. It poses no malware, obfuscation, or security risks, and the scores are consistent with the static analysis.",
