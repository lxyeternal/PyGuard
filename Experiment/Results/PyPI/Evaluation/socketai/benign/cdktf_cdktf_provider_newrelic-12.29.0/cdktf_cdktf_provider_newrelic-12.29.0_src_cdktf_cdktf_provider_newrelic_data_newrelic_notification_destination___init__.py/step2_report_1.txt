  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim:** The code is a generated SDK interface for querying New Relic notification destinations via CDKTF, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Evidence:** Reads parameters, uses jsii for resource interaction, no external data leaks, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Assessment:** The code is primarily boilerplate, with standard class structures, type checks, and resource configuration. No suspicious patterns or malicious indicators are present.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and security risk is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion is consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a legitimate data source for Terraform CDK, with standard patterns.\n- **Evidence:** Reads configuration parameters, no external communication, standard type checks, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code is typical SDK-like infrastructure code, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0, matching the report.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim:** The code manages data for Terraform CDK, with potential data leakage points through 'secure_url' and 'connection' parameters.\n- **Evidence:** Input parameters like 'secure_url' could contain sensitive info; no external data flows or malicious behaviors.\n- **Assessment:** The potential for data leakage exists if sensitive data is supplied, but this is a typical concern in infrastructure code, not malicious intent.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score remains 0, obfuscated is 0, security risk is 0, which is consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis is cautious but reasonable; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim:** The code is a legitimate SDK component, with no malware or malicious behavior.\n- **Evidence:** Reads input data, no network or file operations, standard type validation, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The code is typical for SDKs interfacing with Terraform resources.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The conclusion is consistent and sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim:** The code is a standard SDK module with no malicious activity.\n- **Evidence:** Class definitions, type validation, no external communication, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** All indicators point to a typical infrastructure code pattern.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0, which matches the report.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify the code as generated SDK-like classes for Terraform CDK, managing resource configurations and data access.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, consistent with the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n- **Security Risk:** All are 0, as no external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present.\n- **Potential Data Leakage:** Noted in some reports, but this is inherent to infrastructure code that handles sensitive info, not malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear, generated SDK, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a safe, standard SDK component for Terraform CDK to manage New Relic notification destinations. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is legitimate, generated infrastructure SDK code.  \n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.  \n- The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
