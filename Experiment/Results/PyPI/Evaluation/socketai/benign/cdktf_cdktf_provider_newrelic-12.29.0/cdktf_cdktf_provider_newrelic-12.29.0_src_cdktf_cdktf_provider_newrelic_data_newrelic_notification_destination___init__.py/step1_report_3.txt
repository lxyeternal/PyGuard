{
  "purpose": "This code defines a data source and associated classes for retrieving and managing New Relic notification destination data within the Terraform CDK framework, enabling infrastructure as code management.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from constructor parameters, configuration attributes, and external Terraform state via methods like 'generate_config_for_import'.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage points include 'put_secure_url' and properties exposing 'secure_url' data, which could reveal sensitive URL info. No explicit data exfiltration or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor input parameters to internal attributes and properties. Methods like 'put_secure_url' modify internal state, and attribute getters access stored data. No external or untrusted data sources are invoked dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are observed. The code relies on standard library functions, type guards, and class structures typical for infrastructure code. No obfuscation, network connections, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code adheres to typical patterns for defining Terraform CDK data sources with proper type checks, class structures, and property management. No suspicious behavior such as network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious code logic is evident. The focus is on resource configuration and data access, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, intended solely for managing Terraform data source configurations related to New Relic notification destinations. It does not contain malicious behaviors or sabotage indicators. All observed logic is consistent with infrastructure-as-code patterns.",
