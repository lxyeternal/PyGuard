{
  "purpose": "The code defines a data source class for Terraform CDK that interfaces with the New Relic service to manage service level alert helpers, including configuration structures and helper methods.",
  "sources": "Data input parameters for the class constructor, property setters, and method parameters such as alert_type, sli_guid, slo_period, slo_target, custom_evaluation_period, custom_tolerated_budget_consumption, id, is_bad_events, connection, count, depends_on, for_each, lifecycle, provider, provisioners.",
  "sinks": "Property getters that access internal stored values and methods like generate_config_for_import that may produce import configuration data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into constructor and configuration objects; property setters update internal state; generate_config_for_import and other methods generate import configurations based on stored state.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'publication.publish()' at the end of the file, which is typical for package setup but does not pose a security risk. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic present. The code contains many 'check_type' calls for type validation, which is standard and not suspicious. The presence of helper functions (_typecheckingstub__*) for type hints is typical for generated or checked code and shows no malicious intent. No network or system calls, reverse shells, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily auto-generated or boilerplate for a Terraform CDK data source, including class definitions, configuration data types, and type-checking stubs. It uses standard libraries and packages without any indication of malicious behavior. The only notable activities are type validations, class and property definitions, and method signatures. There are no network operations, file manipulations, or secret leaks. The 'publication.publish()' call suggests packaging or distribution setup but does not imply malicious activity. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, benign infrastructure as code module without malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated module for interfacing with Terraform and the New Relic API. It contains no malicious logic, backdoors, or security risks. The presence of type validation and class definitions indicates it is meant for infrastructure management rather than malicious activity.",
