  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a data source class for CDKTF interacting with New Relic, primarily defining data structures, type checks, and configuration patterns.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are from constructor parameters into internal configuration objects; no external network, file, or code execution occurs.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. Use of stub functions for type checks is standard. The code is SDK-like, focusing on data modeling.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity; high confidence (0.9).  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0. Both are reasonable given the content.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Content:** \"Empty response\" — no information provided.  \n- **Implication:** Cannot evaluate, but no malicious content present.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, describing a data source class for Terraform with configuration and import functions.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data from parameters into class properties; no external communication.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Standard boilerplate; no suspicious code, no network or file operations. Use of jsii and type checks aligns with SDK patterns.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, standard SDK code; very high confidence (0.95).  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0, consistent with analysis.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines a data source class for Terraform CDK with configuration and helper methods.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from constructor parameters into internal state; no external data transmission.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious logic. Use of 'publication.publish()' is typical for package setup.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, benign code; very high confidence (1).  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0, appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, defining a Terraform data source class with configuration data types and methods.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Input parameters to class properties; no external data exfiltration or malicious activity.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Standard auto-generated code, no suspicious activity, no secrets, no obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard infrastructure code; high confidence (1).  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are appropriately low (0 or 0.2), reflecting the benign nature of SDK/auto-generated code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, as the code does not perform any network, file, or system modifications.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the scores assigned in the reports. The code is standard SDK-generated infrastructure as code, with no malicious or sabotage intent. The type checks and class structures are typical and do not suggest obfuscation or malware.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, just due to the complexity of the code and potential for misconfiguration, but not malicious)\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and aligned with standard SDK patterns.**",
