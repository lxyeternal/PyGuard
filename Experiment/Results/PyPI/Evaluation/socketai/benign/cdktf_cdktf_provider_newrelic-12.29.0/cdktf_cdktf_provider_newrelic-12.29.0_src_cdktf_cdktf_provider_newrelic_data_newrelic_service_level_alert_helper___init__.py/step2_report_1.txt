  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a data source class for CDKTF interacting with New Relic, based on standard SDK patterns.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from constructor parameters into internal configs, with no external data transmission.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. Use of stub functions for type checks is standard for generated SDK code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, typical SDK pattern with no malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Security Risk:** Low (0.2), consistent with SDK code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Empty response, no data.\n- **Analysis:** Cannot evaluate, but no code or activity present.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or code.\n- **Confidence:** Not applicable, but default to 0.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining a Terraform data source for New Relic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into class properties; no external network or file activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard patterns for infrastructure code.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard code for infrastructure as code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, defining a data source class with configuration and import functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into class properties; no external or malicious actions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No backdoors, secrets, or suspicious constructs; standard generated code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate SDK code.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar purpose, standard infrastructure code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into internal structures; no external malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior; standard boilerplate, no obfuscation or suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Clearly benign, auto-generated infrastructure code.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity (score 0). The code is SDK-generated, configuration classes, and contains no executable or network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports mention obfuscation; the code is clear and straightforward (score 0).\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or vulnerabilities, the overall risk remains very low (scores around 0.2 to 0.3 are reasonable).\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is standard SDK-generated infrastructure as code, with no signs of sabotage, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The type checks, class definitions, and import functions are typical for such SDKs.\n- No external network, file, or command execution is present.\n- The reports' assessments are consistent with the code content.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (reflecting the inherent complexity but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured SDK code for Terraform CDK, with no malicious or sabotage elements.",
