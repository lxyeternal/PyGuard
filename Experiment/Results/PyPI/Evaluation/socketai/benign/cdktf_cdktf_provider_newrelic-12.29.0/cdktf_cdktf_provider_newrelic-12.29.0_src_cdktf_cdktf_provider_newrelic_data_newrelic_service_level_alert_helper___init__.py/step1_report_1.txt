{
  "purpose": "Define a data source class and associated configuration for interacting with the New Relic service level alert helper within the CDK for Terraform framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard and third-party modules, class initializers, property getters/setters, type hint checks, and stub functions for type validation.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or malicious actions could occur if untrusted input influences network connections, file operations, or code execution, but the code primarily defines data structures and configuration patterns without executing external commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into internal configuration objects and class properties, with type checks and setting of internal state, without executing or transmitting data over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code relies on external libraries and standard patterns for infrastructure as code. The presence of stub functions for type checks and extensive optional parameters might obscure malicious intent but appears consistent with SDK-generated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions, property accessors, and configuration data structures used in infrastructure as code. It performs runtime type checks and object initialization in a typical manner for SDKs. No suspicious network activity, file manipulation, or code execution is evident. The functions with 'stub' in their names serve as type check placeholders, which is standard for type safety in generated code. The code does not include any obfuscated language features, code injection, or hidden backdoors. Overall, the structure and content align with safe SDK patterns, and no malicious behavior or sabotage is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a typical SDK-generated data source and configuration class for Terraform CDK, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It focuses on data modeling, type safety, and configuration management without executing external or harmful actions.",
