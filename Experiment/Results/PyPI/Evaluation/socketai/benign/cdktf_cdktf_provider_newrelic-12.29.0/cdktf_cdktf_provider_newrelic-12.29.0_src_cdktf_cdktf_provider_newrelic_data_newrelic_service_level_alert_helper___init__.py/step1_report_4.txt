{
  "purpose": "Defines a data source class for interacting with the 'newrelic_service_level_alert_helper' in Terraform via CDKTF, including configuration and import functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as 'pkgutil', 'abc', 'datetime', 'enum', 'typing', 'jsii', 'publication', 'typing_extensions', 'typeguard', 'importlib.metadata', and local modules; uses environment variables indirectly via imported modules; reads class and method parameters; accesses class properties and methods.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'jsii.create' for object instantiation; 'jsii.sinvoke' for method invocation; 'jsii.get' and 'jsii.set' for property access and mutation; no other untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Inputs to class constructor flow into configuration object; configuration passed to 'jsii.create'; class methods invoke 'jsii' functions; class properties access internal '_values' dict; no external network, file, or system commands are called.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or suspicious variable names; no dynamic code execution or misleading constructs; standard use of CDKTF and jsii appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a typical CDKTF data source class with configuration, property getters/setters, and import logic. The initial imports are standard modules and local dependencies. 'jsii' functions handle object creation and method calls. The class structure adheres to expected patterns for Terraform CDK constructs. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden backdoors are present. The functions primarily manage configuration and resource state within the expected scope. The type checking stubs are simple no-op placeholders for static analysis, not malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, implementing a standard CDKTF resource data source class with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It follows conventional patterns for infrastructure as code modules and does not contain any signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks.",
