  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the security implications, correctness, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report states the code defines a data source class and configuration for the CDK for Terraform, with no external or malicious actions.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** Data flows are limited to constructor parameters into internal configuration; no external network, file, or code execution occurs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is typical SDK-generated code, focusing on data modeling and configuration management. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (low). The confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code content. The low security risk score is reasonable given the absence of external actions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Content:** \"Empty response\" — no information provided.\n- **Assessment:** Cannot evaluate; no data to analyze.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a data source class for Terraform, with standard patterns.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** Data flows are from parameters into internal properties; no external data sinks.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard for infrastructure as code, with no signs of malicious activity. Use of JSII, dynamic proxies, and boilerplate is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The confidence is very high (0.95).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, a standard CDKTF data source class, with typical imports and configuration patterns.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external network or file operations; data flows within class properties.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Use of 'jsii' functions is standard for SDK code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is benign, auto-generated infrastructure code, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The confidence is perfect (1).\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion is accurate; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports—defining a data source for Terraform/CDK with configuration classes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data exfiltration or malicious actions; data flows are confined to configuration.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The use of 'publication.publish()' is standard for package setup.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard, auto-generated, and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The confidence is high (1).\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code is a typical SDK-generated Terraform CDK data source class with associated configuration data types.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Consistently scored as 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (mostly 0 or 0.2), which is appropriate given the absence of external actions or secrets.\n- **Confidence Levels:** High, indicating these assessments are reliable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Evaluation & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0.0. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be 0.0. No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be very low, around 0.0 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security risk.\n\n**Additional notes:** The code is standard infrastructure as code SDK code, with no signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The extensive use of type checks and generated boilerplate is typical and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, but accounting for minimal configuration complexity)\n\nThis assessment aligns with all provided reports and the code content.",
