{
  "purpose": "Define and manage a Terraform resource for New Relic events-to-metrics rules using CDK for Terraform (CDKTF).",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party modules, and internal JSII bindings; the code reads configuration parameters for resource setup and property inputs.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to process or output untrusted data; it primarily sets internal configuration data for resource management.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (name, nrql, account_id, etc.) flow into resource configuration objects; no external data flows or untrusted sources are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The typeguard checks involve version-based type validation, which is standard. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data leaks are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class and function definitions for managing a Terraform resource via CDKTF, including type-checked constructors, property accessors, and resource import methods. It employs standard patterns for resource configuration and type validation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, file system access, or covert data exfiltration. The presence of type guard functions and resource property setters are typical for infrastructure-as-code modules. No obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or malicious payloads are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate infrastructure management module for a Terraform provider, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It securely manages resource configuration parameters without performing any suspicious actions.",
