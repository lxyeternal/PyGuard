  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logical consistency, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages a Terraform resource for New Relic event-to-metrics rules via CDKTF. It uses standard imports, type validation, and resource configuration. No malicious behavior, external network activity, or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code review. The code is a typical resource class with no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (slightly above zero, but justified as minimal configuration complexity).\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard patterns, type checks, and resource configuration. No suspicious code, dynamic execution, or network activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward class for resource management. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical resource class for Terraform with standard input handling, type checks, and property management. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is legitimate infrastructure code, with no hidden behaviors.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar findings—standard resource class, no external data leaks, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical SDK wrapper, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a resource class for managing New Relic rules, with standard data flow, no external or untrusted data sources, and no malicious behaviors.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears legitimate, with no signs of sabotage or malicious payloads.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low, justified by the nature of the code).\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is a standard resource class for Terraform/CDKTF, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1-0.2), justified by the configuration complexity but not indicating any security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.\n\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal, related to configuration management, not security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a Terraform resource class for managing New Relic event-to-metrics rules via CDKTF. No evidence of supply chain security issues, malicious payloads, or obfuscation.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed. Continue monitoring for any external dependencies or updates, but the current code appears safe and well-structured.",
