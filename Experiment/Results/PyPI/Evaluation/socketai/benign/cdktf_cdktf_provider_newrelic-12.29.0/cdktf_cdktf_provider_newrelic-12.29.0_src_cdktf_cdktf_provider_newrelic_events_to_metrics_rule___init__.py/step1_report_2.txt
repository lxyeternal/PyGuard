{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Terraform resource class for managing New Relic event-to-metrics rules via CDK for Terraform (CDKTF). It provides structures and methods for creating, importing, and configuring these resources.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'name', 'nrql', 'account_id', 'description', 'enabled', 'id'. Data access through class properties and constructor arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include property setters that assign values to resource attributes, which could lead to misconfiguration if malicious data is injected.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through constructor parameters to internal property assignments. Properties like 'name', 'nrql' are set directly via class properties, and some optional parameters are stored in internal dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code uses standard patterns for resource class definitions and type checking. No suspicious dynamic code execution or network operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical resource class definition using jsii and cdktf libraries. It includes type hints, type checking functions, and resource configuration data structures. The 'check_type' functions ensure type safety. The resource properties and methods are standard for Terraform resource wrappers. There is no evidence of obfuscated code, external network calls, or malicious behavior. The imports are standard, and the logic is limited to data encapsulation and validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a Terraform resource class for New Relic event-to-metrics rules. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The design is consistent with typical infrastructure-as-code SDKs. No supply chain security threats are evident.",
