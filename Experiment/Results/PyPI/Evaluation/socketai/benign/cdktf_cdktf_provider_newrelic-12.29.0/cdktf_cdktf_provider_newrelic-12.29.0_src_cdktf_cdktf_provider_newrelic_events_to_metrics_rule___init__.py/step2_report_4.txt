  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages a Terraform resource for New Relic event-to-metrics rules via CDKTF. It uses standard libraries, type guards, and JSII bindings. No untrusted data processing or output is observed.\n\n- **Findings:** The report correctly notes the absence of malicious behaviors, such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The typeguard functions and resource property setters are typical for infrastructure modules.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears legitimate, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate. Obfuscated score of 0 is justified, as the code is clear and standard. Risk score of 0.2 is low but acceptable, given the nature of infrastructure code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, this code defines a Terraform resource class for managing New Relic rules. It involves data flow through constructor parameters and property setters.\n\n- **Findings:** No evidence of backdoors, dynamic code execution, or external network activity. The code employs standard patterns and type checks.\n\n- **Assessment:** Legitimate resource class, safe for use. No malicious behaviors detected.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with findings. Security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines classes and functions for managing Terraform resources, primarily through constructor inputs and property setters.\n\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, external calls, or obfuscated patterns. The code is typical for infrastructure-as-code SDKs.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, appropriate. Security risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, it defines resource classes with configuration parameters, type checks, and jsii interactions.\n\n- **Findings:** No malicious behaviors, network activity, or hidden payloads. The code is standard SDK boilerplate.\n\n- **Assessment:** No security concerns.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, consistent. Security risk is low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines resource classes and configuration data for managing New Relic rules via CDKTF, with standard data flows and no external untrusted sources.\n\n- **Findings:** No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The code uses typical patterns.\n\n- **Assessment:** Legitimate infrastructure code.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe standard resource class definitions, data encapsulation, and type checks for Terraform resources using CDKTF and JSII. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident.\n\n- **Malware Risk:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there are no malicious behaviors.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear, with no obfuscation patterns; scores of 0 are justified.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Given the nature of the code—configuration wrappers for infrastructure—the risk remains low, and scores around 0.1–0.2 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2\n\n**Reasoning:** The code is a straightforward SDK/resource class for managing infrastructure resources. It contains no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The type checks and class structures are standard for such SDKs.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, legitimate, and aligns with typical infrastructure-as-code patterns. No supply chain security concerns are present based on the provided reports.",
