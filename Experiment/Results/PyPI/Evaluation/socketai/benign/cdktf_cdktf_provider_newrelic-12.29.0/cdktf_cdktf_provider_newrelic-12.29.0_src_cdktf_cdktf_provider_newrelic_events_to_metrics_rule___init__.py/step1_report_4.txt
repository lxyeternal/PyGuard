{
  "purpose": "Defines a Terraform resource for managing New Relic events-to-metrics rules via CDK for Terraform (CDKTF).",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters such as name, nrql, account_id, description, enabled, id; imports various libraries and modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses jsii to instantiate and manipulate resources; no untrusted data sinks like network or file operations observed.",
  "flows": "Parameter inputs flow into resource instantiation via jsii.create; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; code appears to be a standard SDK wrapper for Terraform resources.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions, type checks, and resource configuration for deploying New Relic rules using CDKTF. It imports necessary modules, performs type validation, and initializes resource configurations. No suspicious functions or dynamic code execution is present. No network, file, or environment variable manipulation that could indicate malicious activity. The code strictly adheres to resource management patterns and SDK conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of a CDKTF resource class for managing New Relic rules. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The logic is straightforward and adheres to SDK patterns, with no evident security risks.",
