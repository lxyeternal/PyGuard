{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions for managing a Terraform resource related to NewRelic event-to-metrics rules, enabling infrastructure as code automation and resource management.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily received through class constructors, method parameters, and property setters, especially 'scope', 'id_', 'name', 'nrql', and optional configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data could flow into resource properties like 'account_id', 'description', 'enabled', and 'id'. These are used for resource configuration, not for direct data leakage. No apparent sinks for untrusted external output or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into class properties and configuration objects. There are no indications of data flowing into external systems, network communication, or executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only class definitions, data structure setup, type checking, and resource configuration logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. Functions are standard type check wrappers. No use of system calls, network operations, or external data exfiltration mechanisms is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be an auto-generated or standard resource class definition for Terraform CDK (Cloud Development Kit for Terraform). It leverages typed class properties, constructor parameters, and configuration data for managing infrastructure resources. All code uses well-known libraries, and no dynamic code execution or external network activities are observed. The code's purpose is to facilitate resource configuration and import operations, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard resource management class for Terraform in Python, designed to facilitate infrastructure configuration for NewRelic rules. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. It appears to be legitimate and safe for use within infrastructure as code workflows.",
