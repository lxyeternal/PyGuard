{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package for the New Relic provider bindings, managing module imports, version checks, and typeguard configuration for SDK setup.",
  "sources": "Module path extension, importlib.metadata for version info, standard library imports, submodule imports for registration",
  "sinks": "No external data flows, network activity, or data leaks detected",
  "flows": "Module imports and registration without external data transfer or execution flows",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SDK package setup script. It extends module paths, retrieves package version info, configures typeguard based on version, and imports numerous submodules to register types with jsii. There are no external network calls, no obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials, and no malicious patterns. The dynamic imports and version checks are standard in SDK initialization, and the code structure is straightforward and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard package initialization script for a Python SDK for the New Relic provider. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
