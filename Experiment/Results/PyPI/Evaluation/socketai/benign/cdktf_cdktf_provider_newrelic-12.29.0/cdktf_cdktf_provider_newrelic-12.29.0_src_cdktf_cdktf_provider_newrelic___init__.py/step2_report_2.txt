  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the findings are accurate, consistent, and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard package initialization script, managing module imports, version checks, and typeguard configuration. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code's purpose as setting up a Python SDK for the New Relic provider, with no signs of malicious behavior. The logic about dynamic imports, version management, and typeguard configuration is standard for such packages.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is boilerplate for package setup, with no external network activity or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The observations are consistent with the code, which mainly handles module imports, versioning, and type checking. No suspicious patterns or malicious activity are evident.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — **reasonable, given the minimal risk but acknowledging very slight inherent risk in dynamic imports.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the code's role in registering modules with jsii, managing version checks, and module imports. Finds no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes that the code is standard for SDK setup, with no external network calls, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The low security risk score is justified.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — **appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, highlights that the code is a typical package setup script, managing module imports, versioning, and typeguard configuration, with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's purpose and structure. No suspicious activity or malicious patterns are detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing standard package initialization, module registration, and version management. Finds no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion is consistent with the code, which is typical for SDK setup scripts.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — **justified.**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis**\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is a standard SDK initialization script, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code's purpose and find no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Score Justification:**\n  - Malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n  - Obfuscated score is 0, as no obfuscation patterns are present.\n  - Risk scores are low (0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk due to dynamic imports and version checks, which are standard in such packages.\n\n- **Potential for Higher Scores:** Since no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present, increasing scores would not be justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimation**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Slight inherent risk due to dynamic imports and runtime checks, but overall very low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The package appears to be a legitimate, standard SDK setup module with no security concerns.",
