  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and assessing the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard Python package initialization script for a CDKTF provider, involving module path extension, dynamic module imports, version checks, and typeguard configuration.\n- It uses `importlib.metadata` to retrieve package version info.\n- It manages type safety with `typeguard`, adjusting behavior based on version.\n- It imports a large number of submodules, registering types with jsii.\n- No external network calls, file manipulations, or dynamic code execution beyond module imports are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose appears to be setting up a Python SDK for the New Relic provider.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly states that the code initializes a Python package for New Relic provider bindings.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no suspicious behavior, considers it standard boilerplate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, correctly identifies package setup.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Also notes no malicious activity, describes the code as boilerplate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes the code as a package initialization for SDK, managing module imports and type registration.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no external network activity, no suspicious code, and describes the code as standard setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Slightly conservative on securityRisk, which is reasonable given the code's nature. No malware detected.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous, describes package setup.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, standard module registration, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as handling module imports, versioning, and metadata—accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity, standard package initialization.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95\n- **Assessment:** Slightly conservative but justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports 0, consistent with the straightforward, transparent code.\n- **Risk Score:** All are very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Given the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions.** The code is a standard, legitimate package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimation**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (No malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (Code is transparent and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.05** (Very low, just a cautious default for package setup code)\n\n**Rationale:** The code is purely for module registration, version management, and type checking—typical for SDKs and open-source packages. No external or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, legitimate, and standard for its purpose. No adjustments needed beyond minor cautious scoring.",
