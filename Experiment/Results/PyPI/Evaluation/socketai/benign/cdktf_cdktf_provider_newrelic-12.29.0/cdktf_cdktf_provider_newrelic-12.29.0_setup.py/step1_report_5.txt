{
  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata and setup configuration for a Python package 'cdktf-cdktf-provider-newrelic' using setuptools, including dependencies, package data, and project URLs.",
  "sources": "Reading JSON string for package configuration; reading README.md file for long description; importing modules (json, setuptools); defining setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "Calling setuptools.setup() with the prepared kwargs, which will use the provided data to build and distribute the package.",
  "flows": "JSON string parsed into kwargs -> reading README.md -> setup() function call, which processes the package metadata and files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code actions; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. The JSON contains only standard package info. The code reads a local README.md file, which is typical. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package configuration data from a JSON string, including package details, dependencies, and package files. It reads a local README.md for the long description. The setup() call uses this data to prepare the package. There are no signs of malicious code such as code injection, network communication, or hidden behaviors. All actions are consistent with standard Python package setup procedures. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It only manages package metadata and files for distribution.",
