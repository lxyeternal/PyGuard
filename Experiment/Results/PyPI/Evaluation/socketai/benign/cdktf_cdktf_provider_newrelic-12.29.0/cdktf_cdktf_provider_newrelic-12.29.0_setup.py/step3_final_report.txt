  "purpose": "Load package metadata from JSON, read README.md, and invoke setuptools.setup() for package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading JSON string containing package metadata; reading README.md file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "JSON data is loaded into kwargs; README content is assigned to long_description; setup() is called with kwargs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static JSON data, straightforward setup process, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: deserializing static JSON metadata, reading a README file, and calling setuptools.setup(). No suspicious patterns, no obfuscated code, no network activity, and no handling of secrets or credentials. The operations are static and transparent, indicating benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals and scores are consistent with this assessment.",
