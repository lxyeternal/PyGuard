  "purpose": "This script loads package metadata from a JSON string, reads a README.md file for a long description, and sets up the package using setuptools.",
  "sources": [
    "json.loads() call with embedded JSON string",
    "file reading of 'README.md'",
    "setuptools.setup() invocation with provided metadata"

  "sinks": [
    "setuptools.setup() - writes package metadata to build system",
    "reading 'README.md' content into long_description"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "JSON string is parsed into kwargs object",
    "kwargs['long_description']' is set from 'README.md' file content",
    "setuptools.setup(**kwargs) processes the package setup"
  ],
  "anomalies": "The JSON contains extensive package metadata, which is normal for a setup script. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code reads a local file and loads data from a JSON string, both standard procedures. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or network activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code loads package metadata from a static JSON string, reads a README.md file to include detailed description, and invokes setuptools.setup() to prepare the package for distribution. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are detected. The JSON metadata describes package details but does not contain secrets or sensitive data. File reading is straightforward and confined to local filesystem. No external network activity or code injection is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a normal, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs typical operations required for packaging a Python library.",
