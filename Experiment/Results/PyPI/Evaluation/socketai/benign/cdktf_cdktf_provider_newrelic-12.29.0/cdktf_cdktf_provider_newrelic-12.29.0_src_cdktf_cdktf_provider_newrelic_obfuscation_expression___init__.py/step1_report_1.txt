{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Terraform resource class for managing New Relic obfuscation expressions, including configuration data types and methods for resource creation and import.",
  "sources": "Data sources include input parameters such as 'name', 'regex', 'account_id', 'description', 'id', and optional provider, connection, and lifecycle configurations; no external untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are resource attribute setters like 'account_id', 'name', 'regex', 'description', and 'id', which handle user-provided configuration data. No direct output of untrusted data to external systems is observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the configuration object 'ObfuscationExpressionConfig', which then is used for resource instantiation; no evidence of data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks like network transmissions or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a Terraform CDK resource class with type checking and resource configuration. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The presence of type guard functions and extensive type annotations is typical but does not indicate malicious obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured class definition for managing a Terraform resource related to New Relic obfuscation expressions. It uses standard practices for type safety, resource configuration, and import functionality. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or reverse shells is detected. The functions and classes are consistent with infrastructure-as-code tooling, with no suspicious network activity, hidden backdoors, or obfuscated malicious code segments. The use of type guards and extensive annotations enhances code clarity and safety, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate resource class definition for Terraform CDK, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. It follows typical patterns for infrastructure configuration and management without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
