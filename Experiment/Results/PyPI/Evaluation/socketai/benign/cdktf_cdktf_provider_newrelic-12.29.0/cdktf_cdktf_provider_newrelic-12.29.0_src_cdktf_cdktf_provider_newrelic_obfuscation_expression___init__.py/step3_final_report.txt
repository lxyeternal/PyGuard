  "purpose": "Defines a Terraform resource class for managing New Relic obfuscation expressions, with configuration data types and resource management methods.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as name, regex, account_id, description, id, and optional connection, count, depends_on, for_each, lifecycle, provider, provisioners.",
  "sinks": "Configuration objects and resource attributes; no external untrusted data flows or network communication detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into resource configuration and property setters; no malicious or external sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors identified; standard generated code with type checks and framework functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical auto-generated Terraform CDK resource class for New Relic obfuscation expressions. It uses standard patterns, type validation, and resource management functions. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscation techniques. The resource properties are set via constructor and property setters, with no dangerous operations or external system calls. The extensive use of type hints and framework functions serve safety and correctness, not malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe infrastructure resource class with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is negligible.",
