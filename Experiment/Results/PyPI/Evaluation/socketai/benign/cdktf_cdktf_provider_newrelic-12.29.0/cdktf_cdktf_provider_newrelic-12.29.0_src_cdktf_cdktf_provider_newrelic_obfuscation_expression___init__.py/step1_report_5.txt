{
  "purpose": "Defines a Terraform resource for New Relic obfuscation expressions, allowing users to create, configure, and import such resources in a Terraform CDK environment.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters (name, regex, account_id, description, id), environment metadata (package version), and imports modules for resource creation and type checking.",
  "sinks": "Sets resource properties and invokes jsii.create for resource instantiation; no direct sink of untrusted data or external command execution.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into resource configuration, leading to resource creation via jsii; no untrusted data flows to external sinks or network communications.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; the code appears to be standard boilerplate for defining a Terraform resource with type checking and resource configuration. The check_type function adapts based on package version but does not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions, initializers, property setters/getters, and import statements for resource configuration and type validation. It uses dynamic type checking and resource creation via jsii, consistent with CDKTF patterns. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions related to type checking are for validation only, and resource methods are typical for CDKTF constructs. The only potential concern might be the dynamic type checking mechanism, but it is used solely for validation, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a Terraform CDK resource for managing New Relic obfuscation expressions. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or harmful behaviors. It is standard infrastructure-as-code boilerplate with proper type validation.",
