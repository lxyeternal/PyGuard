  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its structure, and the provided evaluations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines a Terraform resource class for New Relic obfuscation expressions. Inputs are standard configuration parameters with no external untrusted sources evident.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into resource configuration; no evidence of data being sent externally or maliciously.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of type guards and extensive annotations is typical for infrastructure code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that this is legitimate with no malicious intent is accurate. The confidence score (0.9) seems appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar resource definition with standard parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous data flows or external system calls. Input data influences resource configuration but not maliciously.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is typical for CDKTF resource classes.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The low security risk (0.1) and malware score (0) are justified.\n- **Scores:** Consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct, no malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard resource class, with inputs from constructor parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or system command execution; data flows into resource configuration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Typical generated code, no signs of malicious logic.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; legitimate code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, standard resource class with typical input sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious data flows; configuration is standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns. Use of jsii and type guards is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is accurate; no malicious signals.\n- **Scores:** Consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard resource code, with configuration parameters and type checking.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous external operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Typical boilerplate, no obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The low security risk and malware scores are justified.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard Terraform resource class for managing New Relic obfuscation expressions. No evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- **Type Guard & Import Mechanics:** These are typical for infrastructure SDKs and serve type safety and framework functionality, not malicious obfuscation.\n- **Scores & Justification:** All malware scores are 0, obfuscated scores are 0, and risk scores are very low, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 to 0.2 — the code is standard infrastructure code with minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a legitimate, auto-generated resource class for Terraform/CDKTF with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The low scores for malware and obfuscation are justified.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or very close to zero)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
