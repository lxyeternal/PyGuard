{
  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ to include additional locations for module discovery, facilitating package namespace extension.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existing __path__ variable (likely provided by the package environment) and the __name__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input from __path__ and __name__ flows into extend_path, which updates __path__ with additional locations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and uses standard library functions in a typical way; no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs are present. The use of extend_path is standard for namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil and updates __path__ by extending it with additional paths for package discovery. This is a common pattern in namespace packages to aggregate multiple distributions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and relies on standard Python functionality. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard namespace package extension without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical implementation used to support modular package distribution.",
