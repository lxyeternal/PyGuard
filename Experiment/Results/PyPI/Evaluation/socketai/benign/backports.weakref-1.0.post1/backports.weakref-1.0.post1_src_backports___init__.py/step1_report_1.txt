  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for compatibility or package modularity purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and the module name (__name__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code extends __path__ to include additional directories for module lookup, primarily internal.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The use of extend_path is standard for namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil and applies it to __path__, which is typical for namespace packages to allow multiple directories to contribute to the package. There are no external inputs, no data being sent or received over networks, and no dangerous code execution or data handling. The code appears minimal and standard for package setup purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, standard snippet for namespace package extension with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
