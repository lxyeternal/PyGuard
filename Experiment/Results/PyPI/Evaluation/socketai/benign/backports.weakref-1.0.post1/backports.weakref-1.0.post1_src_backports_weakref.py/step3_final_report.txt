{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a resource finalizer that executes a user-provided function when an object is garbage collected or during program shutdown.",
  "sources": "Weak reference creation (`ref(obj, self)`), registration with `atexit`, and internal data structures (`_registry`, `_Info`).",
  "sinks": "Execution of `info.func(*info.args, **(info.kwargs or {}))` during finalization or shutdown.",
  "flows": "From object finalization trigger (garbage collection or program exit) to invocation of user-supplied functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected. Standard patterns used.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of Python's `weakref.finalize`, managing finalization callbacks safely via weak references and `atexit`. It executes user-supplied functions during object finalization or program shutdown, which is expected behavior but could be exploited if untrusted functions are provided. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's structure and logic are straightforward, with proper management of the registry and cleanup procedures. The potential security concern is executing untrusted code, but this is inherent to such mechanisms and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard resource finalization utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from executing user-supplied functions, which is expected in such a context. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting inherent risk but no malicious intent.",
