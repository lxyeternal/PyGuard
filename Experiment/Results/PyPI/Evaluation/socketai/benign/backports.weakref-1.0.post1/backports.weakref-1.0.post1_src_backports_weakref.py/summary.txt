  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard resource finalization utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from executing user-supplied functions, which is expected in such a context. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting inherent risk but no malicious intent."
