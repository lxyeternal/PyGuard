{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'backports.weakref' Python package, used to package and distribute the module.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long description; package discovery via 'find_packages' in 'src' directory.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed in a way that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.rst' -> setup configuration -> package discovery and setup options.",
  "anomalies": "Standard setup script with no suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup procedures using setuptools. It reads a README file for description, specifies package location, and sets metadata including author info and license. No external input processing, no execution of untrusted data, and no obfuscated or malicious code detected. The use of 'setup_requires' and 'use_scm_version' aligns with common package versioning practices. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
