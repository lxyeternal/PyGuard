      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard resource finalization utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from executing user-supplied functions, which is expected in such a context. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting inherent risk but no malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured test suite for weakref.finalize, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The subprocess errors are part of standard testing procedures. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to controlled error handling in tests. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is approximately 0.1, reflecting typical testing environment risks."
