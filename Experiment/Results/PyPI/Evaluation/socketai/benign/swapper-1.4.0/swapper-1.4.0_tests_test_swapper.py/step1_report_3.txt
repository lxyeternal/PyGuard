{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the 'swapper' library in Django, testing model swapping functionality, model loading, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Data sources include 'swapper.load_model()', 'swapper.split()', 'settings.SWAP', and Django model attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include model creation ('create'), attribute access ('_meta.fields'), and dependency functions ('dependency').",
  "flows": "Input from 'load_model' and 'settings.SWAP' influences model loading and behavior; data flows through model creation and attribute access, especially in test_create and swapper functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. Usage of conditional skips based on settings is normal for test conditions.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard Django unit testing code, verifying model swapping mechanics and dependencies. No malicious behavior is evident; the code only interacts with Django ORM, test framework, and swapper API. No code injection, data leaks, or suspicious network activity are present. No backdoors or hidden malicious logic are detected. The code's purpose is purely to test model swapping logic. The code appears clean, well-structured, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of Django unit tests for the 'swapper' library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only interacts with models, settings, and test utilities, which are typical for such tests.",
