{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for Django model swapping functionality using the 'swapper' library, ensuring models swap correctly and dependencies resolve as expected.",
  "sources": "Import statements, swapper.load_model, swapper.split, swapper.is_swapped, swapper.get_model_name, swapper.dependency, Django settings, and model method calls.",
  "sinks": "Model creation (objects.create), attribute access (item.type.name, item.type.code), assertions, and exception raising (ImproperlyConfigured).",
  "flows": "Input data (model names, swap settings) flows into model loading and attribute access; no untrusted external data source appears to influence flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious data; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or data leaks observed. Tests are standard Django testing code, with conditional skips based on settings.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of Django test cases validating model swapping functionality. It uses swapper to load models, perform CRUD operations, and verify dependencies and settings. No code reads external untrusted input, no network or file operations, and no suspicious behavior detected. Conditional skips depend on Django settings and swap configurations. The code does not include any obfuscated or malicious code structures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard Django test code validating model swapping features, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate test suite with no supply chain security threats.",
