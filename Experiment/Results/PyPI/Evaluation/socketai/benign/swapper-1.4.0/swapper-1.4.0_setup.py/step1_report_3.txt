{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for the 'swapper' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and description.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file, import statements, and setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is processed or executed at runtime.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> setup() configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except to read a file; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscated code or hidden functions.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup using setuptools. It reads an optional README file, defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and testing parameters. No code injection, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are evident. The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for packaging a Python module, with no malicious or suspicious behaviors detected. It follows standard practices for package configuration.",
