  "purpose": "Setuptools-based configuration for packaging and distributing the 'swapper' Python module.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, importing setuptools, and defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly reads static files and defines package info.",
  "anomalies": "The 'readme' function attempts to open 'README.md' but handles IOErrors gracefully, which is normal. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code is present. The use of 'use_scm_version=True' with 'setuptools_scm' is standard for version management.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration for a Python package. It imports 'setuptools', defines package metadata, attempts to read a README file with error handling, and configures package classifiers, dependencies, and setup requirements. No malicious behaviors, suspicious code, or security risks are detected. There are no code injection, data leaks, or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for the 'swapper' package. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on its content. No anomalies or indicators of sabotage are present.",
