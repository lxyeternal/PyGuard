{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'swapper' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and long description handling.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, package metadata fields, and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into vulnerable functions or causes security issues.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' (source) flows into the 'long_description' parameter; no other data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a try-except block for file reading is standard; no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no suspicious URL or IP activity. The code is straightforward setup logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package setup using setuptools, reading a README file if available, and defining package metadata. There are no suspicious code paths, external data injections, or hidden behaviors. The only notable operation is reading a file, which is safe and standard for setup scripts. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard operations without any anomalies or malicious code patterns.",
