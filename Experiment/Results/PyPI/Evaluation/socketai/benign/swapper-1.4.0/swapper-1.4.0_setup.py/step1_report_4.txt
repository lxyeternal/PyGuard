{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package called 'swapper' to facilitate its distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, package metadata, and configuration parameters for setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading 'README.md' (if exists) into package long_description; metadata flows into setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code detected. The only dynamic operation is reading a README file with exception handling, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for packaging, defines a long description, and attempts to read a README file with fallback. It then calls setup() with standard package metadata and configuration options. No untrusted input sources or suspicious data flows are present. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling occurs. The structure and content are typical for Python package setup scripts and do not exhibit malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It performs typical package configuration without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
