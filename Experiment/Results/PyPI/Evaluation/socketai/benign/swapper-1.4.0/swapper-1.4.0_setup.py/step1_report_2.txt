{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'swapper', including metadata, dependencies, and description.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file as a long description and uses hardcoded package data; no untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data; the code primarily interacts with the filesystem and package metadata.",
  "flows": "The 'readme' function reads from the filesystem; the setup function uses this data for package configuration. No untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The 'readme' function uses a simple try-except for reading a local file without validation; no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup script using setuptools. It includes a function to read a README file, with fallback to a static description. All usage appears typical for package configuration, with no external inputs or data manipulation that could be malicious. The dependencies and classifiers are standard, and there are no signs of malicious payloads, hidden backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads local files for package description and specifies metadata, dependencies, and classifiers without any suspicious activity.",
