  "purpose": "Standard setup.py configuration for packaging the 'swapper' Python module.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, package metadata definitions, dependencies, classifiers, and setup requirements.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "Reading local file 'README.md' to include as long_description; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup script that imports setuptools, reads a local README file with exception handling, and defines package metadata, classifiers, dependencies, and testing info. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle untrusted input beyond local file reading. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The minor use of try-except for file reading is standard and safe. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate; the slight elevation in risk scores (0.1) is marginal and can be considered acceptable given the minimal risk involved in reading a local file. Overall, the code is benign, and the assessments are accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify this, and the minor risk scores of 0.1 could be lowered to 0 for greater precision. Overall, the code poses no security threat, and the assessments are justified.",
