      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify this, and the minor risk scores of 0.1 could be lowered to 0 for greater precision. Overall, the code poses no security threat, and the assessments are justified."

The slight security risk scores reflect the dynamic nature of settings manipulation but are justified by the code's standard patterns. Overall, the code is safe and poses minimal security concerns."

The slight risk score reflects minimal concerns related to test app inclusion and an unexplained flag, but these are common in development settings. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero."

      "conclusion": "The code contains no malware or obfuscation. The main issue is the insecure, hardcoded SECRET_KEY, which poses a security risk if used in production. The overall security risk is moderate, but no malicious activity is detected. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified given the static configuration and security implications."
