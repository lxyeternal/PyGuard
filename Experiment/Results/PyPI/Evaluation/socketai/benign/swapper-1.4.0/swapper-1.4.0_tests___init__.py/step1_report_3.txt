  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; conditional handling based on Django version is standard",
  "analysis": "The script initializes the Django test environment, sets environment variables, and runs migration commands depending on Django version. It conditionally migrates different apps based on the environment setting. The code appears standard for Django testing setup. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors are present. All commands and environment variable usage are typical for a Django test setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django test environment setup script without malicious intent or security risks. It performs environment setup and database migrations in a controlled manner. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
