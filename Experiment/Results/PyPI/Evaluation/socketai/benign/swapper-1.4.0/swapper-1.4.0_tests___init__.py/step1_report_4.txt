  "sinks": "call_command() functions that execute Django management commands",
  "flows": "Environment variable setting leads to environment configuration; then management commands are executed based on Django version",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard Django test environment setup and migration commands are used.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up the Django testing environment by configuring environment variables, initializing Django if available, and running migration commands accordingly. No input validation or external data sources are involved beyond environment variables. The commands executed are typical for Django test setups. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or backdoors are present. The logic adapts to Django versions, which is standard practice. Overall, this appears to be legitimate test environment setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Django testing environments with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
