  "purpose": "This code sets up a Django testing environment, configuring environment variables and running appropriate migration commands based on Django version.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'; Django version check; management commands ('makemigrations', 'migrate', 'syncdb')",
  "sinks": "Management commands executing database migrations; environment variable influencing migration behavior",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' influences which management commands run; version check determines migration method",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution; straightforward environment setup",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Django environment setup, including setting environment variables, initializing test environment, and executing migration commands appropriate for Django version. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The environment variable usage is standard, and the logic is clear and correct. No external network activity, data leaks, or malicious payloads are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: near zero) are consistent with the benign, typical nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django test environment setup script with no malicious intent or security flaws. The scores assigned across reports are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
