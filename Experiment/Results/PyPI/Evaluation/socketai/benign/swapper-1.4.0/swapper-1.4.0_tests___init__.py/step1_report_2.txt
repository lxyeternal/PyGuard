  "flows": "Environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' influences which migrations are run; data flows from environment variables into command execution",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable for setting Django settings, conditional migration commands based on environment variable value",
  "analysis": "The code initializes the Django environment for testing purposes, setting environment variables and executing migration commands. It adapts for Django versions before and after 1.7. It conditionally runs 'makemigrations' and 'migrate' commands, possibly altering the database schema. The environment variable controls which migrations are executed, but there are no signs of hardcoded credentials or malicious code. The code is standard for test setup, with no suspicious logic, data leaks, or external network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical test environment setup for Django projects, performing migrations based on environment variables and Django version. There is no malicious intent, backdoor, or security risk observed. It appears to be standard test environment configuration.",
