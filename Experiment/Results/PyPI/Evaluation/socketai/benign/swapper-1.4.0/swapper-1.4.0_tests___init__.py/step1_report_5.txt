  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to control migration behavior; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script configures the Django testing environment by setting an environment variable for settings. It then checks for Django version to decide which migration command to run. The commands are standard Django management commands for setting up test databases and applying migrations. No user input is directly used; the code relies on predefined settings. There are no suspicious network activities, data leaks, or malicious code behavior. The code's purpose appears solely to prepare a test environment, with proper version handling. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django setup script for testing and migration, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions as intended for environment setup, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
