{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for managing Django model swapping, app prefixes, and dependencies, mainly used in database migrations and configuration management.",
  "sources": "Settings attributes accessed via getattr and setattr, input parameters such as app_label, model, and optional version, and external calls to apps.get_model.",
  "sinks": "Potential setting modifications via setattr, dynamic model loading through apps.get_model, and string formatting for model and app names.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (app_label, model, version) influence setting attributes and model retrieval; get_model_name and is_swapped determine model swapping; load_model dynamically retrieves models, potentially influenced by settings modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Use of dynamic model loading and settings manipulation is typical in Django projects but could be misused if settings are compromised. No obfuscated code or malware patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard Django utility code for managing model swapping and dependencies. It reads configuration from settings and modifies settings attributes as needed. It uses dynamic model loading and string formatting safely within expected Django patterns. No external network or system access, no data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical Django practices. Potential risks are limited to misconfiguration or misuse if settings are maliciously altered, but this code itself does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard Django utility functions for model swapping and dependency management without any malicious intent or behavior. It performs expected configuration and model loading operations without any suspicious activities.",
