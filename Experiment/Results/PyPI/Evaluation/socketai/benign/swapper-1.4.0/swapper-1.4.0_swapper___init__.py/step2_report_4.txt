  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages Django model swapping and dependencies; no suspicious activity or malicious code detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — very high, given the detailed review.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code. No issues or risks are identified. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard Django utilities for model swapping and dependencies, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly above zero, possibly due to the dynamic nature of settings manipulation, but still low.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The report emphasizes that dynamic attribute access and string formatting are standard in Django, which is correct. The slight security risk score accounts for potential misconfiguration but not malicious intent. This seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for model swapping, no malicious code or suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — similar to previous, due to dynamic operations.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard Django configuration functions, no malicious activity, but potential misconfiguration if settings are compromised.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — again, reflecting the potential risk if settings are maliciously altered, but not from the code itself.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion is appropriate. The code is safe; the risk score is cautious but justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for swappable models, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, reflecting standard configuration code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis and scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risks:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) in some reports, justified by the dynamic nature of settings and model loading, which could be misused if settings are maliciously altered. But the code itself isn't malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The code appears to be standard Django utility functions for managing model swapping and dependencies, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — reflecting minimal inherent risk in dynamic settings manipulation, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate, and aligns with Django best practices.",
