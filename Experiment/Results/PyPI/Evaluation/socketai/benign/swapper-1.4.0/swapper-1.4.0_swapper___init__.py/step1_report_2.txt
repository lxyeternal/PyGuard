{
  "purpose": "This code manages Django model swapping and dependency resolution, providing utilities to handle model configuration and dependencies within Django migrations.",
  "sources": "Settings attributes (settings, e.g., get/setattr), app_label and model parameters, swapped model strings, environment variables if indirectly used through Django settings.",
  "sinks": "settings attribute access (getattr, setattr), string formatting for model references, app/model lookups via apps.get_model, exception handling (ImproperlyConfigured).",
  "flows": "Input app_label and model -> swappable_setting and is_swapped determine model swaps -> get_model_name resolves model to swapped or default -> load_model retrieves model class based on swap status.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic string formatting for setting names and model references is normal for Django. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls are present. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or code that executes untrusted data. No network or file operations are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement standard Django utilities for managing model swapping and dependencies, with proper exception handling and no signs of malicious behavior. It manipulates settings and retrieves models in a typical, expected manner for Django applications. There are no external network calls, no data exfiltration mechanisms, nor backdoors. The dynamic string formatting and attribute handling are standard and pose no security concern. The logic aligns with typical Django practices, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django utility module for model swapping and dependencies management. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. No suspicious or harmful activities are identified.",
