{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for managing Django model swapping and dependencies, including handling custom prefixes and model lookups.",
  "sources": "Imports from Django modules (`apps`, `settings`, `swappable_dependency`, etc.), usage of `settings` attributes, and dynamic model retrieval via `apps.get_model`.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic attribute access and modification of `settings`, model lookup via `apps.get_model`, and string formatting for model names and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Functions like `swappable_setting` and `get_model_name` read from `settings` and use string formatting to generate model references; `load_model` retrieves models based on dynamic names; `set_app_prefix` modifies internal prefix mapping.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity observed. Usage of dynamic model resolution and setting attributes is typical in Django applications, not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for managing model swapping, dependencies, and dynamic loading in Django projects. It manipulates `settings` attributes based on app labels and models, ensuring compatibility with Django migrations. The functions use straightforward string formatting and Django ORM features. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors are present. All dynamic operations are standard practices for Django apps managing swapped models.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django utility module for managing model swapping and dependencies with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical dynamic model handling and configuration tasks. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
