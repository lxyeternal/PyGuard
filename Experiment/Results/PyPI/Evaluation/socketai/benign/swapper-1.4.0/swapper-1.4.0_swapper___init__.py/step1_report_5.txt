  "purpose": "Helper functions for managing swappable models and app prefixes in Django migrations.",
  "sources": "User input is indirectly involved via settings and app/model names; code reads from the Django settings, function parameters, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses Django's settings attributes and apps.get_model, which could potentially load models based on dynamic inputs.",
  "flows": "Model names and app labels are retrieved, possibly swapped via settings, then used to load models and manage dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. The code primarily manipulates strings and interacts with Django settings and models.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions to manage swappable models within Django projects, adjusting settings dynamically, and loading models accordingly. It uses standard Django APIs and pattern-based string manipulation. No malicious patterns, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The functions are focused on configuration management and do not perform any data leaks, code injection, or system tampering. The use of dynamic attribute setting and model loading is typical for Django applications managing customizable models. Overall, the code appears legitimate and aligned with common Django practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django utility for handling swappable models and app prefixes. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It is safe and intended for configuration management within Django migrations.",
