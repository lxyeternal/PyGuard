  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing Django model swapping, dependencies, and app prefixes, facilitating dynamic model configuration.",
  "sources": "Settings attributes (via getattr, hasattr, setattr), app registry (apps.get_model), internal dictionaries (_prefixes).",
  "sinks": "Dynamic attribute access on settings, model loading via apps.get_model, string formatting for model identifiers.",
  "flows": "From app_label/model parameters to settings attributes and model retrieval, with potential influence on application behavior based on dynamic settings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute setting and retrieval, which could be misused if settings are compromised, but no malicious patterns or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Django patterns for managing model swapping and dependencies, with functions to generate setting names, check swaps, load models, and manage prefixes. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The dynamic manipulation of settings attributes is typical in Django configurations but could pose risks if settings are maliciously altered. No obfuscation or malicious intent is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the code's nature and potential for misconfiguration, but do not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Django utility module for managing model swapping and dependencies. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The slight security risk scores reflect the dynamic nature of settings manipulation but are justified by the code's standard patterns. Overall, the code is safe and poses minimal security concerns.",
