  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Django utility module for managing model swapping and dependencies. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The slight security risk scores reflect the dynamic nature of settings manipulation but are justified by the code's standard patterns. Overall, the code is safe and poses minimal security concerns."
