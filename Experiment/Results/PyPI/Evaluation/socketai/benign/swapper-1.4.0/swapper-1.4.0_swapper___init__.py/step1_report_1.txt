{
  "purpose": "This code manages Django model swapping and dependency configurations, providing utilities for handling swapped models, prefixes, and model loading.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters, Django settings, and internal dictionaries like _prefixes.",
  "sinks": "Settings attributes (via hasattr, setattr, getattr), and the app registry (apps.get_model).",
  "flows": "Parameters such as app_label and model are used to generate setting names and model identifiers, which are then used to retrieve or set settings and load models from Django's app registry.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. Usage of dynamic attribute setting (setattr) and retrieval (getattr) appears standard within Django configuration management. No external network access or data exfiltration is evident. The code is purely for internal configuration and model management.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical Django app configuration functions, such as managing model swapping, setting prefixes, and loading models dynamically. It uses standard Django APIs (settings, apps) and safe string formatting. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious data handling is present. No external data flows or network communications are involved. The functions serve legitimate purposes related to Django migration and model configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django utility module for managing model swapping and dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is well-structured for its intended purpose and does not exhibit suspicious anomalies.",
