  "purpose": "Define a base type and item models with swappable type model for a Django application.",
  "sources": "Django model field definitions, swapper.get_model_name function call.",
  "sinks": "Database operations involving ForeignKey relationships, model instantiations, or save methods.",
  "flows": "Model definitions do not execute data flows; they define structure and relationships.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'swapper' for dynamic model swapping is standard but can introduce risk if misused; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract and concrete models with fields for name and description, and a ForeignKey to a swappable model. The use of 'swapper' allows dynamic replacement of the 'Type' model, which is common in pluggable Django apps. No user input handling, external data sources, or code execution mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a straightforward model setup without malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django model definition leveraging 'swapper' for dynamic model replacement. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is standard application code with no apparent malicious or security issues.",
