  "purpose": "Define Django models with a swappable 'Type' model for extensibility and an 'Item' model referencing 'Type'.",
  "sources": "Models import, swapper functions, and model field definitions.",
  "sinks": "Database operations via Django ORM, foreign key relations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input or database queries into model instances; no external untrusted input directly processed in code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'swapper' for dynamic model swapping is standard for pluggable app design; no signs of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract base model 'BaseType' with a 'name' field, and a concrete 'Type' model that is swappable via 'swapper'. The 'Item' model references 'Type' through a ForeignKey with dynamic model name retrieval. All imports are standard Django and 'swapper' library usage. There are no input handling, external code execution, or data leakage mechanisms. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The dynamic swappable model pattern is common for flexible Django app architectures. Overall, the code appears purely for model definition and does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django model setup with swappable models for extensibility. There are no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks in this snippet.",
