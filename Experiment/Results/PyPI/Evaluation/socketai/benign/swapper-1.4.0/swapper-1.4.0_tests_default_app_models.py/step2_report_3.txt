  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the same code pattern: Django models with a swappable 'Type' model using the 'swapper' library, and an 'Item' model referencing 'Type' via ForeignKey.\n- The analysis across reports indicates that the code is standard, well-structured, and intended for flexible model replacement.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code patterns are identified.\n- The 'malware' score is consistently 0 across all reports.\n- The 'securityRisk' scores are low, mostly 0 or 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal risk.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), indicating strong agreement that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code does not contain any issues or vulnerabilities.\n- No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or backdoors are present.\n- Use of 'swapper' is a common pattern for pluggable models, not inherently malicious.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws or errors are evident.\n- They correctly identify the code as standard, with no malicious intent.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), but generally low, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\nGiven the analysis, **no adjustments are necessary** for the scores.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports or the code indicate any malicious activity or security vulnerability that would warrant a higher score.\n- The use of 'swapper' is legitimate and common for flexible Django models.\n- No evidence of supply chain attack vectors or malicious code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports' assessments)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- No further action needed.\n- Continue monitoring for any external configuration issues that might arise from the use of 'swapper', but the code itself is safe.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard Django pattern for swappable models with no malicious or security issues detected. The scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
