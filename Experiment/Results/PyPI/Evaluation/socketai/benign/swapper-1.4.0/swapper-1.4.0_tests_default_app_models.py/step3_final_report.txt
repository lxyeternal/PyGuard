{
  "purpose": "Defines Django models with a swappable 'Type' model using the 'swapper' library, enabling flexible model replacement.",
  "sources": "Import of 'django.db.models' and 'swapper'; model field definitions; use of 'swapper.get_model_name' and 'swapper.swappable_setting'.",
  "sinks": "ForeignKey referencing swappable model; no external data input or output; no external code execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "Model definition reads 'swapper' configurations; ForeignKey resolves to a model name via 'swapper.get_model_name'; no dynamic data flow beyond standard ORM behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward use of Django ORM and 'swapper'; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Django patterns for abstract and concrete models, with 'swapper' facilitating model swapping. No malicious or malicious-looking code is present. The use of 'swapper' is common for extensibility, not a security concern. No external data handling, code injection, or obfuscation detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The minimal risk stems from potential misconfiguration, not malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe, and the reports accurately reflect this.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of pluggable Django models with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scoring in the reports is appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
