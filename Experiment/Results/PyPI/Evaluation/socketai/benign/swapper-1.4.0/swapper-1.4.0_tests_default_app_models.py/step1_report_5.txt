  "purpose": "Define abstract and concrete models for item types and items with swappable model support in a Django project.",
  "sources": "Django ORM model field definitions, swapper.get_model_name() call",
  "sinks": "Database model instantiation and foreign key assignment",
  "flows": "Models and foreign key reference from 'Item' to 'Type' using swapper's dynamic model name resolution",
  "anomalies": "Use of swapper for dynamic model swapping is common, but relies on external configuration; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract and concrete Django models with support for model swapping via 'swapper'. No external input is directly read; the model fields are static. The swapper library is used to dynamically determine the 'Type' model, which is a standard pattern for pluggable models. No unsafe code, obfuscated features, or malicious behavior detected. The foreign key and model definitions are conventional. Overall, the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of swappable Django models with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It facilitates flexible model configuration, which is common in extensible Django applications.",
