  "purpose": "Configuration settings for a Django project, including secret key, installed apps, middleware, and database setup.",
  "sources": "Assignment of SECRET_KEY, INSTALLED_APPS, MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES, and DATABASES variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of SECRET_KEY in cryptographic functions or security features.",
  "flows": "SECRET_KEY is used as a cryptographic secret; other settings configure project components without untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded with a simple value '1234', which is insecure; no other suspicious code or behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up configuration parameters for a Django application, including a weak secret key, static app and middleware lists, and an in-memory database. There are no indications of malicious code, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors. The insecure SECRET_KEY is a security concern but not malicious per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django configuration snippet with a weak secret key. No malicious behavior or malware is evident, though the insecure key should be replaced for production. Overall, it poses a security risk due to the weak secret but no active malicious intent.",
