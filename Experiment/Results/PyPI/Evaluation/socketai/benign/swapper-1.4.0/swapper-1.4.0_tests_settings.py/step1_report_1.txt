  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a Django project, defining secret key, installed apps, middleware, and database settings.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements assigning constant values to configuration variables.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded with a simple value '1234', which is insecure for production environments. The use of an in-memory SQLite database is typical for testing but could be suspicious if intended for production, though not malicious by itself. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets static configuration values for a Django project. The SECRET_KEY is set to a weak, easily guessable string, which is a security risk if used beyond development or testing. The INSTALLED_APPS list contains a test app, indicating a test or development setting. MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES is empty, which is unusual for production but acceptable for testing. The database configuration uses an in-memory SQLite database, common for testing. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected based on this configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior but has security concerns due to the weak, hardcoded SECRET_KEY and testing-oriented database configuration. It appears to be a testing or development setup rather than production code.",
