  "purpose": "Configuration settings for a Django project, including secret key, installed apps, middleware, and database configuration.",
  "sources": "Assignment of SECRET_KEY, INSTALLED_APPS, MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES, DATABASES, and SWAP variables.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flow into untrusted sources or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a weak hardcoded SECRET_KEY ('1234'), which is insecure for production environments. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines typical Django project settings with static values. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded as '1234', which is insecure and could be exploited if used in production. INSTALLED_APPS and MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES are standard, with no suspicious modules. DATABASES is configured with an in-memory SQLite database, suitable for testing but insecure for production. The SWAP variable is set to False and appears unused elsewhere, indicating no malicious intent. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior, but the SECRET_KEY's weakness should be addressed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple Django settings snippet with no malicious activity. The only security concern is the weak hardcoded SECRET_KEY, which should be changed for production use. No malware or malicious behaviors are present.",
