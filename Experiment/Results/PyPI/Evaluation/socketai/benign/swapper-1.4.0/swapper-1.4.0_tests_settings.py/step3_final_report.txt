  "purpose": "Static configuration code for a Django project with a weak, hardcoded SECRET_KEY, minimal middleware, and in-memory database, primarily used for testing.",
  "sources": "Assignment of SECRET_KEY, INSTALLED_APPS, MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES, DATABASES, SWAP; no external inputs or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, external communications, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a weak, hardcoded SECRET_KEY ('1234'), which is insecure for production but typical for testing environments.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward Django configuration with no malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the insecure SECRET_KEY, which could compromise cryptographic signatures or session security if used in production. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage is present. The security risk score should reflect the weak secret but is not indicative of active malicious intent. The malware and obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the static, clear code. The risk score of approximately 0.3 appropriately indicates a moderate security concern due to the insecure secret, aligned with the context of testing setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malware or obfuscation. The main issue is the insecure, hardcoded SECRET_KEY, which poses a security risk if used in production. The overall security risk is moderate, but no malicious activity is detected. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified given the static configuration and security implications.",
