  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a Django application, defining secret key, installed apps, middleware, and database settings.",
  "sources": "Assignment of secret key, list of installed apps, middleware tuple, and database configuration dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Potential exposure of SECRET_KEY if used insecurely; no external sinks such as network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted input sources or data flows identified; static configuration values are used.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded SECRET_KEY with a simple value ('1234'), which is insecure; empty middleware list, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static configuration for a Django project. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded with a weak value ('1234'), which can lead to security vulnerabilities if used in production. The INSTALLED_APPS includes only a test app, and middleware is empty, indicating a minimal or testing environment. No external input, network activity, or suspicious code constructs are present. The database is configured for in-memory SQLite, typical for testing, with no indication of malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic configuration snippet for a Django project, primarily intended for testing or development. The use of a weak hardcoded SECRET_KEY is a security concern, but there is no malicious code or behavior present. Overall, it appears benign but insecure for production use.",
