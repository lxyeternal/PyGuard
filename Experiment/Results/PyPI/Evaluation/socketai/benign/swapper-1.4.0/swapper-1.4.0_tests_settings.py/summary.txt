  "conclusion": "The code contains no malware or obfuscation. The main issue is the insecure, hardcoded SECRET_KEY, which poses a security risk if used in production. The overall security risk is moderate, but no malicious activity is detected. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified given the static configuration and security implications."
