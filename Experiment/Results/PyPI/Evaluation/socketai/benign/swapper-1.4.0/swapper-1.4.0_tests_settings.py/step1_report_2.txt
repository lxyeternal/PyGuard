  "purpose": "Configuration settings for a Django project, including secret key, installed apps, middleware, and database setup.",
  "sources": "Constant assignment of SECRET_KEY, INSTALLED_APPS, MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES, and DATABASES dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Use of SECRET_KEY in Django security mechanisms; database connection parameters.",
  "flows": "The SECRET_KEY is used internally by Django; database settings influence database interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The SECRET_KEY is a simple, insecure value ('1234'), which is a hardcoded credential; minimal middleware; use of in-memory SQLite database.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django configuration snippet. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded as '1234', which is insecure and could compromise Django security features like cryptographic signing. No external input sources or untrusted data handling are present. There are no malicious code patterns such as network connections, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The use of an in-memory database is typical for testing environments and not inherently malicious but indicates a non-production setup. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. Overall, the code is basic configuration with a notable security weakness due to the SECRET_KEY value.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple Django configuration snippet with a very insecure SECRET_KEY but no malicious intent or harmful behavior detected. The security risk is primarily due to the weak secret key, which should be replaced with a secure, randomly generated value for production use.",
