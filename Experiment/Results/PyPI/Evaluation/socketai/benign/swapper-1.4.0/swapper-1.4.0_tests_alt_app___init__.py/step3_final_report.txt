  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network endpoints, dynamic code execution functions (eval(), exec()), file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, data leaks, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input data or environment variables -> dynamic code execution or network functions -> potential data exfiltration or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec(), hardcoded suspicious URLs/IPs, obfuscated variable names, dynamic imports, network activity to external domains, suspicious patterns without clear benign purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high suspicion if it uses eval()/exec(), obfuscated variables, or communicates with suspicious domains, indicating potential malicious intent. Benign code lacks these features, showing straightforward data processing or simple network requests. The presence of obfuscation and dangerous functions increases malware and security risk scores. Absence of such features correlates with low scores. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the described behaviors. The most suspicious report (Report 2) justifies high malware (0.75), obfuscation (0.7), and security risk (0.8). Benign reports (1, 3, 4, 5) correctly have scores of 0 or near-zero, reflecting their safe nature.",
  "conclusion": "The evaluations and scores are well-aligned with the code behaviors described. Report 2's high scores are justified by the suspicious features, while other reports correctly indicate benign code. No adjustments are necessary based on the provided information.",
