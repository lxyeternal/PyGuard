  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script intended for basic data processing or utility functions. There is no explicit indication of malicious intent based on the provided fragment.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'input' variable or function parameters, if any. No external data sources or network inputs are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements or return values. No untrusted data outputs, network transmissions, or file writes are visible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to output sinks via variable assignments and function calls. No complex or suspicious data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual language features are detected. The code structure appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and appears to perform routine operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or privilege escalation. The lack of external dependencies or suspicious constructs supports this. Without additional context or hidden code, the assessment remains low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious activity or security risks. The code appears benign and straightforward.",
