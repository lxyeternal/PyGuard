  "purpose": "Define a Django model 'Type' that inherits from 'BaseType' with an additional 'code' field.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django models and 'BaseType' from another app.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or cause security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model field definitions to database schema; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's models and a base class, then defines a new model 'Type' extending 'BaseType' with a 'code' SlugField. The Meta class specifies an app label. The code appears to be a standard Django model definition with no signs of malicious intent, no external input handling, and no suspicious code constructs. There are no hardcoded secrets, no data leaks, or malicious behaviors evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward Django model definition with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It serves to define a database schema component within a Django application without security risks.",
