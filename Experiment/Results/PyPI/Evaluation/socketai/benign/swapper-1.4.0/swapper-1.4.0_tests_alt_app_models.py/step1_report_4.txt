{
  "purpose": "Define a Django model named 'Type' that inherits from 'BaseType' and adds a 'code' field.",
  "sources": "Import statements from Django and a local module 'tests.default_app.models', and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external effects; model definition does not process input directly.",
  "flows": "The code imports dependencies, then defines a model class with a single field, with no data flow or external data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django model declaration extending 'BaseType' with a single 'SlugField'. No processing of untrusted data, external network calls, or suspicious code behavior is present. It imports standard modules and a local base model, adhering to common Django conventions. No anomalies or malicious indicators detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a normal Django model definition with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not involve data leaks, external communications, or security vulnerabilities within the provided scope.",
