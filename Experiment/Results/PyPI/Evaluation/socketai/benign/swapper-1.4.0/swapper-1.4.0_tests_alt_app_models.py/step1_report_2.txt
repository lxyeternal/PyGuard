{
  "purpose": "Defines a Django model class 'Type' that inherits from 'BaseType', adding a 'code' field.",
  "sources": "Imports from Django ORM and a local 'BaseType' model; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No potential sinks or untrusted data handling points; primarily model definition.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only declares a data model.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django model definition inheriting from 'BaseType'. It introduces a 'SlugField' named 'code'. It imports 'models' from Django and a local 'BaseType' model. There are no user inputs, external data reads, or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or backdoors. The model's purpose appears to be data schema definition, with no apparent malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard Django model class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted input or perform any operations that could be exploited.",
