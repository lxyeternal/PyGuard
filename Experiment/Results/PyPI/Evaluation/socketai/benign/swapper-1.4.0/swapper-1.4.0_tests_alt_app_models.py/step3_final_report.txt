  "purpose": "Define a Django model 'Type' extending 'BaseType' with a 'SlugField' named 'code' and specify the app label.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'django.db.models' and 'tests.default_app.models'.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Import from 'tests.default_app.models' which is unconventional outside testing environments but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django model with minimal complexity. It imports necessary ORM components and a base class from a test module. The model adds a 'SlugField' and specifies an app label. No external inputs, outputs, or network interactions are present. The import from 'tests' could be a concern if used in production, but it does not constitute malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores at 0 and low security risk scores. The only minor concern is the import path, which could be flagged in deployment hygiene but does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Django model with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The import from a test module is a minor concern for code hygiene but not security-related. Overall, the security risk is negligible.",
