{
  "purpose": "Define a Django model named 'Type' that inherits from 'BaseType' with an additional 'code' field.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django models and a base class from an external app; class definition with field declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this code solely defines a data model.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's models and a base class, then defines a new model 'Type' extending 'BaseType'. It adds a 'code' field of type SlugField, which is standard in Django for URL-safe strings. The Meta class assigns an app label. There are no external data inputs, no code execution, or network activities. The code appears straightforward and typical for Django model definitions, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django model definition with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply extends an existing base model with a new field and specifies an app label.",
