{
  "purpose": "Defines a Django model named 'Type' that extends 'BaseType' with an additional 'code' field.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'django.db' and 'tests.default_app.models'; class definition and field declarations.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no handling of untrusted input, no data output, no external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; simple class inheritance and field declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious code constructs. The import from 'tests.default_app.models' could be unconventional in production but isn't inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Django ORM components and a base class from a test module. It defines a model 'Type' extending 'BaseType' with a single 'SlugField'. The 'Meta' class specifies an app label, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, code injection, or backdoors. The import path from 'tests' might suggest test code inclusion, which could be a concern if used outside testing environments, but as presented, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Django model definition with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. The only minor concern is the import from a 'tests' module, which might be inappropriate outside testing contexts but doesn't constitute malicious behavior.",
