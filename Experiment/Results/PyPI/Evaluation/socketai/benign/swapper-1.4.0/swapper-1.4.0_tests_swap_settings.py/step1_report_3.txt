  "purpose": "Configure application settings by importing and extending settings from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from . import settings', usage of 'settings' attributes for configuration.",
  "targets": "No direct untrusted input or data manipulation present; configuration data used.",
  "flows": "Import of settings → assignment of configuration variables → extension of 'INSTALLED_APPS'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; 'SECRET_KEY' is sourced from 'settings'. 'SWAP' is set to True without context, but not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local 'settings' module and assigns its attributes to local variables. It appends an app to 'INSTALLED_APPS'. No untrusted data sources, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The only notable point is the addition of 'tests.alt_app' to 'INSTALLED_APPS', which could be a testing artifact but not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward configuration setup with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration snippet importing and extending settings. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The usage is typical for Django or similar frameworks, with no signs of malware or malicious activity.",
