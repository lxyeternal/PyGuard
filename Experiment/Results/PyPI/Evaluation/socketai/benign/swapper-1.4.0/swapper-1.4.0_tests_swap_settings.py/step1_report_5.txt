{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a configuration module that imports settings from a local module and assigns certain configuration variables for a Python application, likely a Django project.",
  "sources": "Reading from local module '.'' (import settings), and accessing attributes such as MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES, DATABASES, INSTALLED_APPS, and SECRET_KEY from settings.",
  "sinks": "Assignment operations that modify or utilize imported configuration variables, such as appending to INSTALLED_APPS, and setting SECRET_KEY.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported settings module into local variables, then potentially modifies or extends these variables (e.g., adding 'tests.alt_app' to INSTALLED_APPS).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets other than SECRET_KEY which is imported from settings; the code dynamically extends INSTALLED_APPS. The presence of 'SWAP=True' is unusual but not inherently malicious; it could be a flag used elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code imports configuration settings from a local module and assigns them to local variables. It then appends an additional application ('tests.alt_app') to the list of installed apps, which might be for testing purposes. The SECRET_KEY is imported, avoiding hardcoding secrets in this file. The 'SWAP' flag is set to True, its purpose is unclear but not suspicious by itself. There are no suspicious functions, network operations, or data leaks. The code structure is straightforward and typical for configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration pattern, extending the installed apps list for testing. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
