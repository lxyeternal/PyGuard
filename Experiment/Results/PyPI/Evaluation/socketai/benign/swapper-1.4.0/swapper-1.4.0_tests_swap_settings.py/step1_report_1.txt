{
  "purpose": "Configuration setup importing settings and defining application constants.",
  "sources": "Imports from local module 'settings', access to attributes like SECRET_KEY, DATABASES, MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES, INSTALLED_APPS.",
  "sinks": "None directly involving untrusted data; no sinks for untrusted input or external output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'settings' module into local variables; no user input or external data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials beyond referencing 'settings.SECRET_KEY'. The addition of 'tests.alt_app' to INSTALLED_APPS is typical for testing environments; no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports configuration data from a local 'settings' module, assigns multiple settings variables, and appends a test application. There is no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external data handling. No evidence of malicious behavior or malicious code patterns. The only potential concern is the exposure of SECRET_KEY, but since it is imported from 'settings', which presumably manages secrets securely, there is no indication of compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It follows typical Django-like project patterns for importing and configuring application settings.",
