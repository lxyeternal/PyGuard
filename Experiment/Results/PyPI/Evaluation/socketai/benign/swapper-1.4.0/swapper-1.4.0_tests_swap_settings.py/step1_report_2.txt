  "purpose": "Configure application settings by importing and assigning settings values, and extend installed apps.",
  "sources": "Import statement for local settings, assignment of constants and settings variables, tuple concatenation for INSTALLED_APPS.",
  "sinks": "Assignment operations that use imported settings, especially SECRET_KEY and INSTALLED_APPS.",
  "flows": "Imported settings are used directly in variable assignments; adding 'tests.alt_app' to INSTALLED_APPS affects application modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets aside from SECRET_KEY which is imported; appending an app 'tests.alt_app' might be for testing, not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports configuration settings from a local module, then assigns these to local variables. It adds a test app to the INSTALLED_APPS list, which is a common development practice. The SECRET_KEY is imported from settings, not hardcoded. No code injection, dynamic execution, or suspicious data flow is evident. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. All actions appear standard for a Django-like settings module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration snippet with no signs of malicious behavior. It properly uses imported settings and appends a test module, which is typical. No security threats or malware indicators are present.",
