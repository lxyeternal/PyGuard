  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code imports settings, assigns variables, and appends a test app. No untrusted data, no dynamic execution, no obfuscation. The only potential concern is the SECRET_KEY, but it's sourced from a presumably secure settings module.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, given it's a standard configuration.\n\n- **Comment:** The reasoning is sound. No issues with the logic or code flow. The confidence is high.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard pattern: import, assign, extend INSTALLED_APPS with a test app. No suspicious activity or data flow.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — still low, considering it's a typical test app inclusion.\n\n- **Comment:** The analysis is consistent. No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern: import, assign, append to INSTALLED_APPS. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no external data.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — standard configuration.\n\n- **Comment:** The conclusion aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, straightforward import and assignment, appending a test app, no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — consistent with minor testing configuration.\n\n- **Comment:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern: import, assign, extend INSTALLED_APPS, no suspicious behavior. The variable `SWAP=True` is noted as unusual but not malicious.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — negligible.\n\n- **Comment:** The analysis is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple configuration snippet. No evidence of code execution, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** None apparent. All reports agree on the benign nature.\n\n- **Scores Justification:**\n\n  - **Malware:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which is justified given the code's nature.\n\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n\n  - **Risk:** Very low, reflecting the minimal security concern.\n\n- **Potential Adjustments:**\n\n  - The risk scores could be uniformly set to 0, given the absence of any suspicious activity or security concern. The small risk scores (0.1 or 0.2) seem to account for the inclusion of a test app, which is standard in development but could be flagged in strict security assessments. However, since it's a common pattern, maintaining a very low risk score (e.g., 0) is reasonable.\n\n- **Additional Considerations:**\n\n  - The `SECRET_KEY` is imported from `settings`, which is best practice. No hardcoded secrets are present.\n\n  - The `SWAP=True` variable is unusual but not malicious; it could be a feature flag or configuration parameter.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (consistent with all reports and code analysis).\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected).\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk present).\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard configuration pattern for a Python (likely Django) project. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The inclusion of a test app is typical and not suspicious. The scores should reflect this by setting malware, obfuscated, and risk scores to zero for an accurate security assessment.",
