{
  "purpose": "Configuration setup importing settings, extending installed apps, and defining variables for a Python project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local 'settings' module, reading variables like SECRET_KEY, MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES, DATABASES, INSTALLED_APPS.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'settings' into variables; appending 'tests.alt_app' to INSTALLED_APPS; no external or untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable 'SWAP=True' without context; appending a test app ('tests.alt_app')—common in testing but potentially misused if deployed in production.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration snippet importing settings, assigning variables, and extending the installed apps list. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The SECRET_KEY is imported from a settings module, which is standard practice. The 'SWAP' variable is an unexplained feature flag but not inherently malicious. The inclusion of a test app is typical for development environments. The code does not involve any external data, dynamic execution, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified given the benign nature, with minor risk due to test app inclusion and the 'SWAP' flag. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign configuration snippet with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The slight risk score reflects minimal concerns related to test app inclusion and an unexplained flag, but these are common in development settings. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero.",
