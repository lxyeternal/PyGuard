  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their findings, scores, and reasoning.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no untrusted data, no obfuscation. The only potential concern is the exposure of SECRET_KEY, but it is imported from 'settings', which is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues identified. The low risk score reflects minimal concern.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1—standard configuration, appending a test app, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score, possibly due to the addition of a test app, but still reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—importing settings, appending a test app, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent; the zero risk score aligns with the lack of issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable, given the context.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others, with mention of 'SWAP=True'—not inherently suspicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- **Code content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward configuration loader importing settings and extending the installed apps list.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** All reports assign zero, which is appropriate. No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable, considering the addition of a test app and the 'SWAP' flag, which is unexplained but not suspicious.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified; no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Given the context, a low but non-zero risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate, reflecting minimal concern but acknowledging the presence of test app inclusion and an unexplained 'SWAP' flag.\n\n### My overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: the code is standard configuration code with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The slight risk reflects the inclusion of test components and the unexplained 'SWAP' variable, which warrants minimal concern but no immediate threat.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are consistent.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The overall evaluation indicates no security threat from this code snippet.",
