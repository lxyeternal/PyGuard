  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for testing extension modules, but its dynamic import mechanism without validation poses a security risk if untrusted modules are present. No malicious code is evident, and the malware score should be 0. The primary concern is the potential for code execution via filesystem manipulation. The security risk score should be around 0.4, reflecting the moderate risk due to dynamic import without validation."
