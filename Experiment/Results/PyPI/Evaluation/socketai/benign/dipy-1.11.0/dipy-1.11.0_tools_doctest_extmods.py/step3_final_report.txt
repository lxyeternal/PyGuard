{
  "purpose": "Collects extension modules from a specified package by traversing its directory and runs doctests on each imported module.",
  "sources": "Filesystem traversal to find files with shared object extension; module name construction from directory structure; dynamic import via __import__() based on filesystem paths.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import (__import__) executing code during module loading, potentially executing malicious code if modules are compromised.",
  "flows": "Input package name -> filesystem walk -> identify extension files -> construct module names -> dynamic import -> run doctests.",
  "anomalies": "No validation or sanitization of module names before import; reliance on filesystem structure; no sandboxing or validation of imported modules.",
  "analysis": "The script performs filesystem traversal to locate extension modules and dynamically imports them without validation, which can execute malicious code if malicious modules are present. The use of __import__() on filesystem-derived module names is inherently risky, especially in untrusted environments. No obfuscation or network activity is detected. The main security concern is code execution during import, which could be exploited if an attacker places malicious modules in the package directory. The code itself is benign and intended for testing, but its approach introduces potential security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for testing extension modules, but its dynamic import mechanism without validation poses a security risk if untrusted modules are present. No malicious code is evident, and the malware score should be 0. The primary concern is the potential for code execution via filesystem manipulation. The security risk score should be around 0.4, reflecting the moderate risk due to dynamic import without validation.",
