  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate automation utility with no active malicious intent or payloads. The primary security concern is the unsafe use of subprocess with shell=True and unvalidated inputs, which could be exploited in malicious environments. The malware score remains at 0, and the obfuscation score at 0. The overall security risk is low but warrants caution regarding input sanitization. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and appropriate."
