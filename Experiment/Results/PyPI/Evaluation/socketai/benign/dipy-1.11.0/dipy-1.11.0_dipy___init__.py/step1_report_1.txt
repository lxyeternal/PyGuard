{
  "purpose": "The code provides documentation and utility functions related to the 'dipy' package for diffusion imaging in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as sys.version, sys.executable, sys.platform, and the numpy and dipy package versions. It also imports the 'dipy' package and the 'version' module.",
  "sinks": "None observed; there are no data sinks or external communications, no logging, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "The get_info() function gathers environment and package data for potential reporting or debugging, but it does not transmit or store this data externally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code mainly consists of standard imports, documentation, and a utility function.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing system modules and 'dipy' components, and defining a utility function to collect environment details. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious logic. The submodules list appears to be for package organization, and no external or untrusted inputs are processed. The purpose appears purely informational and organizational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving documentation and environment information purposes. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The security risk is negligible.",
