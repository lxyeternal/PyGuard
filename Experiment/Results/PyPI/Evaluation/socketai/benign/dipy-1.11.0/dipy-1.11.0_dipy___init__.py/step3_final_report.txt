{
  "purpose": "Collects environment and package version information for the dipy library and its submodules.",
  "sources": "Imports from os.path, sys, numpy, and dipy; data from __version__ and sys module attributes.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The function get_info() gathers system info and package versions without external data flow or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign utility module that provides environment and package metadata. It imports standard modules and the dipy package, defines a function to collect system info, and lists submodules for package organization. No external network calls, data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a utility for environment info collection. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores accurately reflect its safe nature.",
