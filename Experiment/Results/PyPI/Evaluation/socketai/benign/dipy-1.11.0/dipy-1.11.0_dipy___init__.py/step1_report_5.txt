{
  "purpose": "Provides metadata and utility functions for the 'dipy' diffusion imaging Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads data from standard library modules (os.path, sys), and the 'dipy' package's version module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no network, file, or external system interactions with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The function 'get_info()' gathers system and package information, but does not process untrusted input or produce untrusted output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a version attribute from the 'dipy' package. The 'get_info()' function collects environment and package metadata. It appears to be a benign utility for gathering system and package info. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or data exfiltration observed. The list of submodules and metadata exports are standard for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility module for a scientific Python package. It contains no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious code elements are present. Overall, this code is safe and intended for legitimate purposes.",
