{
  "purpose": "The code provides metadata and utility functions for the 'dipy' Python package, primarily for versioning and information retrieval about the package environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the package's own modules, such as 'dipy.version', and system environment variables like 'sys.version', 'sys.executable', and '__file__' for obtaining system and package information.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data for effects such as data leaks, system modification, or network activity.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing internal modules and system data, then assembling a dictionary with environment and version info, without any data processing that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns are present. The code performs straightforward information collection and module listing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system modules and internal package data to compile environment information. It defines a function 'get_info' that retrieves system and package details without executing any external or untrusted code. The list of submodules and exports is static and defined explicitly. No external data sources or network interactions are present, and no suspicious behaviors such as code injection or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard utility module for package metadata and system info collection. It contains no malicious or suspicious behaviors. Overall, the code appears safe with a security risk score close to zero.",
