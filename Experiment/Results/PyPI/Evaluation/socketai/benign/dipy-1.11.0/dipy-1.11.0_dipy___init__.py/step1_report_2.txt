  "purpose": "This script provides metadata and utility functions for the 'dipy' package, including version info and submodule listings.",
  "sources": "Reads input from __file__, dipy.version.git_revision, sys (version, executable, platform), and numpy.__version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external outputs; no data leaks or external communications are present",
  "flows": "get_info() collects system and package information without propagating untrusted data externally",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation observed; functions are straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a function to gather environment and package info. The submodules list and __all__ variable are standard for module exports. No malicious logic, network activity, or suspicious behaviors detected. The function get_info() only returns system and package metadata, with no external calls besides standard imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module providing package metadata and submodule listings. No indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
