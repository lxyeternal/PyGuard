  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code is straightforward, mainly importing modules, defining a `get_info()` function, and listing submodules.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data exfiltration.\n   - The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain any suspicious patterns.\n   - The submodules list and `__all__` are standard for package organization.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - All reports consistently identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n   - The reports correctly interpret the purpose and behavior of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (~0.1).\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - None of the reports assign such high scores.\n   - Given the benign and transparent nature of the code, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - No claims in the reports are based on unfounded assumptions; all are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the benign analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score**: **0.1** — Very low, reflecting the minimal security concern.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard utility module for a scientific package, serving informational purposes without any malicious or suspicious elements. The existing scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Note:** No further action needed; the code is safe.",
