{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate synthetic diffusion MRI phantoms, add noise, and simulate various fiber configurations for imaging analysis and testing.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function parameters (e.g., t, angles, radii, func), external data files via get_fnames, and optional rng for randomness.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include add_noise (adding noise to data), and data storage in volumetric arrays, but no direct untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from parameter inputs to calculations in orbital_phantom, through eigenvector computations, tensor simulations, and noise addition, ending with volumetric data output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are detected. Usage of random number generator is standard; no suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a scientific simulation tool for creating diffusion MRI phantoms. Functions are well-documented, with clear input and output parameters. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are identified. The noise addition uses standard numpy and dipy functions. No network connections, data exfiltration, or system harm routines are present. External data files are loaded from standard dipy datasets for simulation purposes, and there are no hidden or suspicious code pathways. The overall structure is typical for scientific computation, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate scientific simulation script for generating diffusion MRI phantoms. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe for use in research and testing environments.",
