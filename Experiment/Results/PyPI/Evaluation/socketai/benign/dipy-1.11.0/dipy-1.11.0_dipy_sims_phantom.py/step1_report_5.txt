{
  "purpose": "This code generates synthetic diffusion MRI phantoms with optional noise addition for testing and simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters for noise addition, functions generating the orbit-based phantom data, and user-defined functions for shape generation.",
  "sinks": "Potentially adds noise to data, modifies the 'vol' array, and performs file I/O indirectly through 'get_fnames'. No direct untrusted data sink identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed to generate a 3D/4D volume. The 'add_noise' function applies noise to the data. The 'orbital_phantom' creates and modifies 'vol' based on geometric calculations. Noise or data parameters flow into the 'add_noise' function, which affects the output volume.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code uses standard scientific libraries with expected functionalities. No obfuscation, code injections, or malicious code patterns detected. Commented-out code for visualization is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a scientific simulation script designed to generate diffusion MRI phantoms with optional noise. It employs legitimate mathematical operations, numpy array manipulations, and library functions to create synthetic data. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. It does not perform network communications, access system files, or execute external commands. All functions and parameters align with standard simulation tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign scientific tool for generating synthetic diffusion MRI data. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It mainly performs data generation and noise addition for research purposes.",
