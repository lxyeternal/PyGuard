{
  "purpose": "This code generates synthetic diffusion MRI phantoms based on 3D orbit functions, adds Rician noise, and models diffusion tensors for simulating diffusion-weighted imaging data.",
  "sources": "Reads data from numpy arrays, user-defined functions for orbit paths, and external data via get_fnames(), gradient_table(), and numpy random generator rng.",
  "sinks": "Adds noise to data via vox.add_noise(), creates diffusion signals with single_tensor(), and potentially reads from external files through get_fnames().",
  "flows": "Data is generated or imported (e.g., orbit paths, gradient tables), then processed through eigenvector calculations, tensor simulations, and noise addition. Noise is added to the diffusion signals, and the volume data is constructed by summing signals at various positions determined by the orbit functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The code uses standard scientific libraries and functions. No obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or system modifications are present. Commented-out code and plotting code are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code creates synthetic diffusion MRI data using mathematical functions and standard neuroimaging libraries. It computes eigenvectors for diffusion tensors, simulates diffusion signals, and adds Rician noise, all within expected scientific computation practices. External data acquisition via get_fnames() is used solely for loading gradient information. The noise addition, tensor calculations, and data synthesis follow standard procedures without signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate scientific tool designed for generating and analyzing diffusion MRI phantoms. It contains no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is well-structured for simulation purposes, with no suspicious network, system, or data leakage activities.",
