{
  "purpose": "The code generates diffusion MRI phantoms, adds Rician noise, and models diffusion tensors for simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "External data via get_fnames() for gradient information; input parameters for orbit functions and noise settings.",
  "sinks": "No external data exfiltration or network communication; data flows within the simulation functions and noise addition.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> data generation (orbit functions) -> tensor modeling -> noise addition -> output volume.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code structure is clear and scientific.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard scientific simulation tool for generating diffusion MRI phantoms with optional noise. It relies on well-known libraries and external data sources typical for such tasks. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The noise functions and tensor modeling are legitimate procedures. External data dependencies are standard and do not pose security risks. The optional RNG parameter is used for reproducibility, not malicious purposes. Overall, the code is benign and intended for research.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent scientific tool for diffusion MRI phantom generation with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minimal external data use and standard practices confirm its safety.",
