  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate pytest setup for test discovery and execution. It employs dynamic imports based on filesystem paths, which could be exploited if the environment is compromised, but in standard controlled testing environments, this is acceptable. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, with a low to moderate security risk due to dynamic import potential."
