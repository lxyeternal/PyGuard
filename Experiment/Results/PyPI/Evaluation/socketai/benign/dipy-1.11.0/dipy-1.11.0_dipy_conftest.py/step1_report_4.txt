  "purpose": "The code configures pytest for testing a Python project, including custom test collection, warning handling, and test execution.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (DIPY_WERRORS), pytest configuration options, and file paths during test collection.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable evaluation affects test behavior; imported modules could execute code if imported dynamically.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence whether warnings are treated as errors. During test collection, modules are dynamically imported based on filename patterns, and test functions are called during runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Use of dynamic import with `importlib.import_module()` is standard for plugin or test discovery but could potentially execute malicious code if a malicious module is present and imported. The code does not contain obfuscated code or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages pytest test collection and configuration. It uses regex to identify test modules and imports them dynamically for test execution, which is a common pattern but carries a risk if malicious modules are present in the filesystem. It sets numpy print options to maintain compatibility and modifies warning behavior. The custom exception class is straightforward. No suspicious network activity, file modifications, or malicious payloads are present. The code appears to be standard test infrastructure with safe practices. Dynamic imports should be noted but are not inherently malicious in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest configuration script for managing test discovery, execution, and warning behavior. No malicious behavior or sabotage is detected. The only potential security concern is the dynamic import of modules during test collection, which is typical but could be exploited if malicious modules are present in the filesystem.",
