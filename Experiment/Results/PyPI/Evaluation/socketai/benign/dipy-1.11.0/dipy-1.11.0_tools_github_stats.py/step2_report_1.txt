  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described code and logic, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script queries GitHub issues/pulls, handles pagination, generates reports. No malicious behavior, no secrets, no obfuscation. Uses standard libraries, no suspicious URL or data leaks.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis. No malware detected.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, justified given the script's limited scope and safe operations.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears accurate. The code is a standard open-source utility with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing network requests, subprocess calls to git, no secrets or obfuscation, straightforward API interactions.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — still low, justified given the limited scope and no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the script as benign, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on API calls, git commands, no suspicious code, no secrets, no obfuscation, standard data flow.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no apparent risks.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriately classifies the script as safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar analysis—API requests, git commands, no malicious activity, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly assesses the script as benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others—API interactions, git commands, no secrets, no obfuscation, straightforward.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — matches the analysis.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's transparency.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2), but all are justified given the script's operations—mainly network requests and subprocess calls to git, which are standard and not inherently risky.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward, and well-structured.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — a minimal security concern due to subprocess usage and network requests, but nothing that indicates a real threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign, standard utility for project maintainers to gather stats. No evidence suggests malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score |\n|---------|--------------|------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1        |\n\nThis reflects a safe, transparent script with negligible security concerns.",
