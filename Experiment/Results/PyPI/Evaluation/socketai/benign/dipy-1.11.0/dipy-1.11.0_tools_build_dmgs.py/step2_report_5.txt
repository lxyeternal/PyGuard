  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the security implications, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring consistency.\n\n**Common Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- All reports identify that the script uses `shell=True` in `subprocess.check_call` via `my_call`, which is a known security risk if inputs are not sanitized.\n- The `globber` argument is directly interpolated into remote addresses and commands without validation, creating command injection vectors.\n- Use of `sudo` in commands (`reown_mpkg`, `hdiutil`) increases risk if malicious input is provided.\n- No input validation or sanitization is performed on user inputs.\n- No evidence of embedded malware or obfuscation is present.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious payloads.\n- The security risk scores are high (~0.75), justified by unsafe command execution practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Discrepancies:\n\n- **Presence of Issues in Code:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is vulnerable to command injection due to unsanitized inputs and use of `shell=True`. No report claims the code contains embedded malware or obfuscation, which is consistent with the code review.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:**  \n  The reports are consistent and thorough. They correctly point out the unsafe use of `shell=True`, lack of input validation, and potential privilege escalation via `sudo`. No logical errors or false claims are evident.\n\n- **Scores Justification:**  \n  The malware scores are 0 in all reports, justified because there's no evidence of malicious code or payloads.  \n  The security risk scores (~0.75) are reasonable given the unsafe practices and potential for exploitation.\n\n- **Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n  The high risk scores are justified due to command injection potential, privilege escalation, and remote command execution vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Malware Score Justification:**  \n  Since there's no malicious code or payloads embedded, malware scores are correctly 0.\n\n- **Assumptions about Vulnerabilities:**  \n  All reports avoid assuming malicious intent; they only identify security vulnerabilities. This is appropriate.\n\n- **Score Consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis: high security risk (~0.75), malware (0), obfuscated (0).\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Recommendations:\n\n- The core issue is unsafe command execution practices, not embedded malware.\n- The high security risk scores are justified due to the potential for exploitation.\n- To improve security, the script should:\n  - Avoid `shell=True` in subprocess calls.\n  - Sanitize or validate user inputs (`globber`) before use.\n  - Avoid using `sudo` unless necessary, or implement proper privilege handling.\n  - Use safer methods for constructing commands (e.g., passing arguments as lists).\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code observed)  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n**Risk Score:** ~0.75 (high, due to unsafe command execution and privilege escalation potential)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe script's primary security concern is unsafe handling of user input leading to command injection, which could be exploited in a malicious environment. It does not contain malware or obfuscation but is risky in untrusted contexts.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The scores reflect the actual security posture: high risk due to unsafe practices, no malware or obfuscation. The main mitigation involves input validation, avoiding `shell=True`, and careful privilege management.",
