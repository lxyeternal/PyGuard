  "purpose": "Utility functions for directory handling, command execution, and Python file compilation in the nibabel project.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for directory input, static commands in c() and compile_tree() functions",
  "sinks": "os.system() calls executing system commands, potential for command injection if inputs are untrusted",
  "flows": "sys.argv input to get_dipydir() then to directory validation; user-controlled input to c() if misused; static commands in compile_tree()",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() without sanitization, but inputs are controlled or validated; no obfuscation or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions with minimal security risks. The primary concern is the use of os.system() which could be risky if extended to untrusted inputs. Currently, commands are static or validated, and no malicious behavior is evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.2-0.3), consistent with the reports. No backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no signs of malicious intent. The main security consideration is cautious use of os.system() with untrusted inputs. Current scores are appropriate; the code can be safely used with standard precautions.",
