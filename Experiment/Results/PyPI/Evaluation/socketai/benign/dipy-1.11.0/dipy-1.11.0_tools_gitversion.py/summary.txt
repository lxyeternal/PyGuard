  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard version management utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The subprocess call is secure given the fixed command, and environment variables are used appropriately. The existing security risk scores slightly above zero are justified but could be lowered to zero. Overall, the code poses no security threat, and the reports accurately reflect this."
