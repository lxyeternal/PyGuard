  "purpose": "Define and expose detailed version information for the installed scipy package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings, splitting version string, and defining release status based on version content.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version info -> conditional check on release status -> possibly adjusting version variable.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic present. The code only deals with version info handling.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables for the scipy package, including version strings and release status. It performs straightforward string operations and a conditional check based on the version string content. No user input, environment variables, network operations, or security-sensitive actions are present. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs. It appears to be a simple metadata module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely handling version metadata without any malicious or security-threatening behavior. It is typical for package version modules.",
