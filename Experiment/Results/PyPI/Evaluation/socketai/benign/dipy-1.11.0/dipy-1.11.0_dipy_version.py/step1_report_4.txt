{
  "purpose": "To define and expose detailed version information for the installed 'scipy' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it assigns hardcoded strings and performs string operations on these constants.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data or external systems are accessed or manipulated; no sinks related to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only assigns static values and performs straightforward string operations without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior. The code solely defines version-related variables using static data.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version information for the package, parsing version strings and setting release flags. There is no input/output, no dynamic code execution, and no interaction with external systems. The string splitting and variable assignments are standard and do not exhibit malicious patterns. The code appears to be standard metadata definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for version information storage with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is straightforward and lacks any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
