  "purpose": "Expose detailed version information for the installed `scipy` package, including version strings and revision data.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version strings and git revision; string operations on version string.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Static data assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static version and revision info, processes the version string to derive a short version, and determines if the version indicates a release. It involves no external input, network activity, or dynamic execution. The logic is simple, clear, and typical for version metadata modules. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The code's purpose is purely informational, with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version info module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
