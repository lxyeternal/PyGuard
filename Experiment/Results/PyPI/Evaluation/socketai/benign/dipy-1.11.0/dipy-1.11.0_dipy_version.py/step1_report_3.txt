{
  "purpose": "Define and expose version information for the installed `scipy` package",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings, splitting version string, checking for release status",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or untrusted data handling points",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only handles internal data assignments and checks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no suspicious behaviors; straightforward version info handling",
  "analysis": "The code assigns version-related variables, splits the version string, and checks whether the version indicates a release or development version. It appears to be standard package metadata handling without any external data input or sensitive data processing. No obfuscated code, no network communication, and no potentially malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely manages version information for the `scipy` package in a typical manner, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
