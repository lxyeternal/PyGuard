  "purpose": "To expose detailed version information for the installed 'scipy' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads version-related strings and hardcoded revision data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; no external data or outputs to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The version string and git revision are assigned and processed internally without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses hardcoded version and git revision data; no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly assigns version information and processes version string for release identification. It does not perform any data manipulation, external input/output, or dynamic code execution. The hardcoded values are typical for version reporting modules. There are no suspicious constructs, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version info module with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
