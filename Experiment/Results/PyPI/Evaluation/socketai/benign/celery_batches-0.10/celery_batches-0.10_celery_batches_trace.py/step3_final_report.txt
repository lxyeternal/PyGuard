  "purpose": "This code implements task execution tracing in a Celery-like environment, managing signal dispatching, context stacks, and error handling during task execution.",
  "sources": "Function arguments (task, args), signal receivers, UUID generation, context stack push/pop, exception handling",
  "sinks": "Signal dispatching functions (send_prerun, send_postrun, send_success), logging errors",
  "flows": "Task invocation -> signal dispatch (pre, success, post) -> exception handling -> context stack management",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; standard pattern; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Celery task tracing utility, with proper signal handling, context management, and error logging. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. Signal handlers are external and could be malicious if untrusted, but this is outside the code's scope. No obfuscation, code injection, or insecure data handling detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of task tracing with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. External signal handlers pose a potential risk if malicious, but this is outside the code itself. The current scores are justified and appropriate.",
