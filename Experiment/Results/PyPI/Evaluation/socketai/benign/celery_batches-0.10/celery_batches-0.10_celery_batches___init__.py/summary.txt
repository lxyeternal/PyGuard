  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of Celery batching, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified by the handling of untrusted message payloads, but no vulnerabilities are evident. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0."
