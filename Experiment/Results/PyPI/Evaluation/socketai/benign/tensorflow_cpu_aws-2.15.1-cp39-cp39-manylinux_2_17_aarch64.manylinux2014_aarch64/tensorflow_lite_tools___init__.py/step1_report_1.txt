  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python package module potentially used for some form of data processing or functionality extension.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function arguments, and potentially external modules. No explicit external data sources like files, network, or user input are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include usage of system commands, network connections, or file writes if present. However, based on the visible code, no explicit unsafe sinks like exec, subprocess calls, or file writes are identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or function parameters into internal functions or variables. There are no clear flows leading to dangerous sinks such as network transmission or system modification in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible. The code does not contain obfuscated constructs or unusual language features. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful code are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly at multiple points: the start, middle, and end. It primarily involves standard Python constructs, imports, and functions. No malicious behavior, malware signatures, or security risks are evident. The structure is straightforward, and there are no signs of obfuscation or hidden code. There is also no evidence of malicious data handling or system interference.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious activities or security issues detected.",
