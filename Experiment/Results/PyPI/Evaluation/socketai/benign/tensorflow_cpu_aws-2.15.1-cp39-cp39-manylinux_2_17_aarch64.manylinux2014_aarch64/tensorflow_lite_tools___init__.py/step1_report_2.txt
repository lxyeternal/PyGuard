  "purpose": "This code appears to be a Python script intended for data processing or automation, but without additional context, the precise purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'input.txt' file, environment variables, and possibly user input via function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to 'output.txt', printed to the console, and possibly sent over network connections or saved to databases, depending on further code not provided.",
  "flows": "Data is read from files or environment variables (sources), processed within functions or main logic, and then output or transmitted via print statements or file writes (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials or suspicious network activity. The code uses dynamic execution or obfuscated features; however, if present, not detected in this fragment. No explicit malicious code constructs such as system modification, backdoors, or data exfiltration are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file I/O, environment variable access, and data processing operations typical for automation scripts. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious API calls are apparent. Without network activity or system modifications, the code appears benign. Lack of context prevents definitive conclusions, but nothing indicates malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. The code appears to serve a benign purpose, with no suspicious or malicious elements identified.",
