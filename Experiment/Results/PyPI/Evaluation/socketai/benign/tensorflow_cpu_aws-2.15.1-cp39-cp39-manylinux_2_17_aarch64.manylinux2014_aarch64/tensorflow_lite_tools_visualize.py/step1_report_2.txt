{
  "purpose": "This script generates an HTML visualization of a TensorFlow Lite model by parsing a TFLite flatbuffer or JSON model file and producing an interactive D3.js graph and associated tables.",
  "sources": "Reads input model file (TFLite or JSON), reads model data into memory, reads operator and tensor data from the flatbuffer or JSON structure.",
  "sinks": "Writes output HTML file; embeds model data as JSON for visualization; loads external D3.js library via URL.",
  "flows": "Loads model file -> parses into dict/flatbuffer -> generates HTML + embedded JSON -> writes HTML to file.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code appears standard for visualization purposes, with no suspicious dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or network communications.",
  "analysis": "The code properly reads model files, converts flatbuffer to dict, and generates an HTML visualization with embedded data. No use of untrusted inputs beyond file reading, and no execution of dynamic code from untrusted sources. External library is loaded via CDN for visualization, which is typical for web-based visualizations. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The overall logic is straightforward and aligns with standard visualization scripts. No malicious behaviors or sabotage evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard visualization tool for TensorFlow Lite models with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely reads model data, converts it for visualization, and outputs an HTML file with embedded data and visualization scripts. No suspicious or malicious code was identified.",
