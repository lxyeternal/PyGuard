{
  "purpose": "The code creates an HTML visualization of a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model, including subgraph graphs, tensors, operations, buffers, and operator codes.",
  "sources": "Reads TFLite model files (.tflite, .json) from disk; loads model data into memory; processes operator codes, tensors, and subgraph data.",
  "sinks": "Generates HTML content that includes embedded JavaScript for visualizations; writes HTML output to specified file.",
  "flows": "Reads model data from file -> Parses or loads into dict -> Converts data into HTML with embedded visualization scripts -> Writes output HTML file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; code uses standard libraries and safe file operations. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a data processing and visualization tool for TensorFlow Lite models. It reads input files, parses model data structures, and generates static HTML pages with embedded D3.js scripts for visualization. The code uses standard Python modules (json, os, re, sys, numpy) and does not perform any network communications, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior. The embedded JavaScript code for visualization is static and related solely to rendering the model graph. The data flows are straightforward, from file input to HTML output, with no external or untrusted data sources involved beyond the model file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard visualization utility for TFLite models, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The script performs safe file operations and data processing without any network or system compromise activities.",
