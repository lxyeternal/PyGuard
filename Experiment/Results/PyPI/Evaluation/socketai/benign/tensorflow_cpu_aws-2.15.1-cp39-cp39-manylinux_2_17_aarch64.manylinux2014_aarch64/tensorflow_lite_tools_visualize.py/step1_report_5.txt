{
  "purpose": "The code generates an HTML visualization of a TensorFlow Lite model, including graph rendering and data tables.",
  "sources": "Reads model files (.tflite, .json) from filesystem, and potentially reads environment variables or file contents.",
  "sinks": "Writes output HTML file to disk. Uses data from files to generate HTML and JavaScript for visualization.",
  "flows": "Reads model files → parses into dicts → generates HTML with embedded JSON data → writes HTML file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Uses external D3.js library via CDN, which is standard for visualization.",
  "analysis": "The script reads TensorFlow Lite model files (.tflite, .json) from disk, parses their content into nested dictionaries, then constructs an HTML page with embedded JavaScript code for visualization using D3.js. It provides utility functions for converting model components into human-readable formats and creates interactive graph visualizations. There are no indications of malicious code such as network communications, data exfiltration, or backdoor logic. The file handling appears standard, with no use of untrusted input beyond file reads, and no dynamic code execution other than standard JSON parsing and string formatting. External libraries are loaded via CDN without obfuscation, and the code appears structured solely for visualization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate function of visualizing TensorFlow Lite models and contains no malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage indicators. It reads model files, processes their content, and outputs an HTML visualization. There are no suspicious data leaks, network activity, or hidden backdoors detected.",
