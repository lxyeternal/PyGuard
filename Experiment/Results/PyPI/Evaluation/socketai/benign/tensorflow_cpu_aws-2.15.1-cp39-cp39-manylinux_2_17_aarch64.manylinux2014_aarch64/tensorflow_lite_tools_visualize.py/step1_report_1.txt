{
  "purpose": "The code generates an HTML visualization of a TensorFlow Lite model, including graphs and tables of model components.",
  "sources": "Reads model files (.tflite, .json) from disk; loads data via json.load() or file read; reads command-line arguments for input/output file paths.",
  "sinks": "Writes HTML output to a specified file; uses json.dumps() for graph data embedded in HTML; uses open() for reading and writing files.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> read file -> parse into dict/flatbuffer -> generate HTML -> write to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No dynamic code execution or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads model files (either binary .tflite or JSON), processes model data into a nested dict, and generates a comprehensive HTML visualization using embedded JavaScript. The code does not include any network connections, data exfiltration, or system modification commands. It performs standard file I/O and data processing for visualization purposes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms are present. The only notable aspect is that it renders visualizations based on external input files, but this is a standard feature for model visualization tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign TensorFlow Lite visualization tool with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It reads model files, processes data, and outputs HTML for visualization. No suspicious activities or malicious code components are detected.",
