  "conclusion": "Most code is benign, with clear and straightforward logic. The suspicious report with obfuscation and eval usage warrants attention but does not confirm malicious activity. Slight score adjustments (malware from 0.4 to 0.5, risk from 0.6 to 0.6) better reflect the suspicion level. Overall, the supply chain risk is low to moderate, with no definitive malicious payloads detected."
