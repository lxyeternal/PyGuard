  "purpose": "A TensorFlow Lite debugging utility for quantization analysis, collecting metrics, and outputting CSV reports.",
  "sources": "Tensor data from interpreters, user-defined metric functions, tensor details, dataset generator inputs.",
  "sinks": "Metric calculations, CSV file output, in-memory tensor processing.",
  "flows": "Input tensors -> user-defined metrics -> CSV output; tensor details and model inference flow within interpreters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads; relies on user-defined functions which could be malicious if supplied by an attacker.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard debugging utility for TensorFlow Lite models, allowing collection of layer and model discrepancy metrics. It uses interpreters to run models, processes tensor data, and outputs CSV reports. The only potential security concern is executing user-supplied metric functions, which is an inherent plugin risk. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses standard APIs. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious activity. The security risk score is low (around 0.2), reflecting the plugin architecture's inherent risk. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9+).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate TensorFlow Lite debugging utility with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The only risk stems from the execution of user-defined metric functions, which is an accepted aspect of plugin-based systems. Scores are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
