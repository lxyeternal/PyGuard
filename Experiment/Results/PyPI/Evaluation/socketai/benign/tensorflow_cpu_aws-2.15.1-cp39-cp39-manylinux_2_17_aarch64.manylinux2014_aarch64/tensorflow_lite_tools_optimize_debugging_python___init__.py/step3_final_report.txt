  "purpose": "Assessment of supply chain security risks in the analyzed open source Python dependency, focusing on malicious behaviors, obfuscation, and security vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "Use of eval and exec functions, hardcoded IP addresses and ports, environment variables, network communication, obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, suspicious strings, and potential data exfiltration points.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, external domain connections, data sent over sockets, environment variable access, and dynamic code execution functions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec and hardcoded addresses lead to network communication or data exfiltration sinks; environment variables and input data flow into execution or transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of eval/exec on untrusted data, hardcoded IP addresses and ports, complex control flow, suspicious network endpoints, and potential data exfiltration behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The highest suspicion is in Report 1, which uses eval/exec, hardcoded addresses, and transmits data externally, justifying high malware (0.75), obfuscation (0.7), and security risk (0.85) scores. Report 4 also shows obfuscation and network activity, with moderate malware (0.4) and risk (0.65). Reports 2 and 5 are benign, with scores of zero or near-zero, reflecting no suspicious activity. Report 3 indicates potential red flags but lacks concrete malicious indicators, leading to low scores. The scores are consistent with behaviors described, with the most suspicious behaviors in Report 1 and 4, and benign patterns in Reports 2 and 5.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential in Report 1 due to dynamic execution and data exfiltration, warranting high malware and risk scores. Reports 2 and 5 are benign with low scores. Reports 3 and 4 show moderate suspicion, justified by obfuscation and network activity. Overall, the scoring aligns with the described behaviors, with no adjustments necessary.",
