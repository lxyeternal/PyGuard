  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a basic utility or script with no explicit indication of malicious intent; however, detailed analysis is needed to confirm.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown; no user input, environment variables, or external data reads are evident.",
  "sinks": "No dangerous functions, network connections, or sensitive data handling are observed.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable source-to-sink data flows, as no input or output pathways are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no obfuscated parts, no hardcoded credentials, and no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code shows standard Python constructs with no signs of malicious behavior. No external data sources, no insecure data handling, and no suspicious network activity are detected. The code does not utilize risky features like dynamic code execution, unsafe SQL, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Without specific context, it appears to be benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code seems safe and does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities.",
