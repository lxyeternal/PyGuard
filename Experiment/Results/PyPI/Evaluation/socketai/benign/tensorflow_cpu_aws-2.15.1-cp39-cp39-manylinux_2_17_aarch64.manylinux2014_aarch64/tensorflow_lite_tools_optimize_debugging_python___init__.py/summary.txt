  "obfuscated": 0.6,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential in Report 1 due to dynamic execution and data exfiltration, warranting high malware and risk scores. Reports 2 and 5 are benign with low scores. Reports 3 and 4 show moderate suspicion, justified by obfuscation and network activity. Overall, the scoring aligns with the described behaviors, with no adjustments necessary."
