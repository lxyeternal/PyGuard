  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, standard TensorFlow initialization script with no malicious intent. The use of environment variables for dynamic library loading introduces a typical, manageable risk but does not constitute malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2–0.3, reflecting the potential but unexploited attack surface."
