  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, files, network data, untrusted input, and potentially executes code via eval/exec.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writes, system commands, data exfiltration points, and code execution paths.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment, files, untrusted data) flow into eval/exec, network, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, use of eval/exec with untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, suspicious strings, convoluted code sections.",
  "analysis": "The code contains risky patterns such as eval/exec with untrusted input, obfuscation, and hardcoded secrets, indicating potential malicious intent. The presence of suspicious strings and convoluted code supports suspicion. Benign code lacks these features. The high confidence scores in suspicious cases are justified. No signs of system damage or covert backdoors are observed outside these patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious or suspicious activity, primarily due to unsafe code execution practices, obfuscation, and hardcoded secrets. The scores reflect these findings accurately, with higher malware and security risk scores assigned to the suspicious code. Benign code is correctly scored low or zero. Minor adjustment: increase confidence in report 2 from 0.7 to 0.8 to better align with suspicion level.",
