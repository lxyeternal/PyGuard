  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious or suspicious activity, primarily due to unsafe code execution practices, obfuscation, and hardcoded secrets. The scores reflect these findings accurately, with higher malware and security risk scores assigned to the suspicious code. Benign code is correctly scored low or zero. Minor adjustment: increase confidence in report 2 from 0.7 to 0.8 to better align with suspicion level."
