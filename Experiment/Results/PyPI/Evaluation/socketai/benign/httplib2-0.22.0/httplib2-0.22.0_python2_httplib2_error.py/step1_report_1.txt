  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to HTTP library errors, including those with response details.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions and their constructors.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network or file system access, or external command execution.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; only class attribute assignments and inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base error class, with some classes accepting response and content objects during initialization. The classes are simple and standard for error handling. No input/output operations, network communications, or data manipulations that could be exploited are present. The structure appears typical for error hierarchy definitions, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions intended for error handling in an HTTP context. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation is standard, and there are no suspicious elements.",
