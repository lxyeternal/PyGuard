  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for HTTP-related errors, enabling error handling in an HTTP library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and __init__ methods assigning response and content attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely structural with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; straightforward class hierarchy.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions inheriting from base exceptions, with constructors storing response and content objects. No external data handling, network operations, or malicious code are present. The classes serve as error indicators within an HTTP library. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected. The code is standard, well-structured, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception classes for an HTTP library, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0, with high confidence. The code poses no threat and is suitable for use.",
