  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for HTTP library errors and responses.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions, including constructor for HttpLib2ErrorWithResponse.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "None; the code only defines exception classes without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard exception class definitions with no hidden or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of exception classes related to HTTP errors, some of which include response data. The classes are straightforward, primarily for error handling within an HTTP client library. There are no indications of data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior. No suspicious code, backdoors, or unusual behavior are present. The constructor of HttpLib2ErrorWithResponse stores response and content, but these are typical for error context. No external calls, dynamic code execution, or security-critical operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for an HTTP library. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code's purpose is clear, and there are no signs of malicious intent or security threats.",
