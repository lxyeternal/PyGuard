  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various HTTP-related errors in a Python library.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions, particularly the __init__ method in HttpLib2ErrorWithResponse where parameters are assigned to instance variables.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the response and content attributes in HttpLib2ErrorWithResponse could be accessed elsewhere; however, these are standard exception attributes.",
  "flows": "Exceptions can be raised during HTTP operations and caught elsewhere; no complex or risky data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes for handling HTTP errors, including classes with additional response data. The __init__ method assigns parameters directly to instance variables, which is standard. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious control flow. The code is straightforward and appears to be standard for a network-related library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical exception class hierarchy for an HTTP library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign component for error handling.",
