  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling HTTP library errors and related response errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing; exceptions are used for error handling only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no processing or data manipulation present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes related to HTTP errors, some with additional attributes to store responses and content. The classes inherit properly and follow standard Python practices. No data is read from external sources, nor are there any sinks that process untrusted data. The structure is straightforward and typical for error handling in network libraries. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining custom exceptions for HTTP errors without any malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be standard, safe, and appropriate for a network-related Python library.",
