{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for HTTP library errors, with some supporting response content.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reads; classes are static definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; class inheritance and initialization only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, inheriting from standard exception classes with no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. All classes are straightforward and only serve as error identifiers. There are no suspicious activities such as network access, data leaks, or backdoors. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions for an HTTP library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as part of error handling in an HTTP library and contains no malicious intent.",
