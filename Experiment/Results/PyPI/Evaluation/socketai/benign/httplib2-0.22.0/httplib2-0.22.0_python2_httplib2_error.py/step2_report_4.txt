  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, as well as the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to HTTP errors.\n- No data processing, external input/output, or network interactions are present.\n- The classes are straightforward, inherit properly, and include optional response/content attributes.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, assigning a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, with high confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies class definitions and constructors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0, confidence 1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, focusing on class hierarchy.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity or data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0, confidence 1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0, confidence 1.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on the static nature of class definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0, confidence 1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Highlights the straightforward __init__ method and attribute assignments.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity or security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0, confidence 1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's nature, 0 is appropriate; no security risks are present.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:** No changes needed. The code is safe and the scores are appropriate.",
