  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for an HTTP library.\n   - No untrusted data handling, network or file system access, or external command execution is present.\n   - The classes are simple, inheriting from base exceptions, with some storing response and content objects.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is purely structural and error-handling related.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - The assessments appropriately note the absence of malicious or risky behavior.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - confidence: 1\n   - These scores are reasonable given the analysis.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores align with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk scores are 0, indicating no security concern.\n   - Since the code is only class definitions with no malicious or exploitable behavior, this is appropriate.\n   - No justification for higher scores is needed.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports agree on 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, data exfiltration, or malicious control flow.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as standard exception class definitions.\n   - No false positives or exaggerated concerns are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate across all reports.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception classes.\n- No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The scoring reflects this accurately.\n\n**My Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a typical, safe component of an HTTP client library, with no security concerns.",
