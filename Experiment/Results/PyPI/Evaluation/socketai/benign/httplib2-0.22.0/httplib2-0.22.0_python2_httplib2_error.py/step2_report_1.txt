  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to an HTTP library.\n- No input/output, network, or file system operations are present.\n- The classes inherit appropriately, and the __init__ methods assign parameters to attributes.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a straightforward, standard exception hierarchy with no issues or malicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n- The reports consistently state that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n- They correctly identify that the classes are simple, with no data flow from untrusted sources or external systems.\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' reasoning is sound and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n- These scores are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**4. Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores:**\n- Since the code is purely structural and contains no suspicious or malicious elements, higher scores are unwarranted.\n- The risk scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**5. Malware Score Consideration:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n- No malicious behavior is present or implied.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n### My Own Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall, the code is safe and standard.**",
