  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to locate CA certificate files for certificate validation, with support for custom and third-party sources.",
  "sources": "Reads the environment variable 'HTTPLIB2_CA_CERTS'; attempts to import 'certifi' and 'ca_certs_locater' modules; reads the file system to check for certificate files.",
  "sinks": "Returns file paths for CA certificates; raises RuntimeError if environment variable points to an invalid file; outputs path when run as main.",
  "flows": "Reads 'HTTPLIB2_CA_CERTS' env variable -> validates file -> returns it; otherwise calls external module functions or defaults to built-in path.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward environment variable handling and module imports; no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports optional modules and checks an environment variable for a CA certificate path. If the env variable is set and points to a valid file, it uses that; otherwise, it falls back to optional modules or defaults to a bundled CA bundle. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic detected. The code performs expected configuration logic related to certificate management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing CA certificates with safe environment variable handling and optional external module support. No malware, malicious intent, or security risks are evident.",
