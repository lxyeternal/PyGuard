  "sources": "Environment variable HTTPLIB2_CA_CERTS, module imports certifi and ca_certs_locater, file system (os.path, __file__).",
  "sinks": "Return statements providing file paths for CA certificates.",
  "flows": "Environment variable HTTPLIB2_CA_CERTS -> where() function -> return path; import certifi/ca_certs_locater -> where() -> return path; default to BUILTIN_CA_CERTS.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code mainly reads environment variables and imports modules to determine CA bundle location.",
  "analysis": "The code imports optional modules for locating CA certificates, checks for an environment variable to specify custom CA file location, and falls back to default or module-provided locations. No data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or code injection observed. The logic is straightforward and adheres to typical configuration patterns. No suspicious behavior or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for locating CA bundle files, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs environment variable checks and module imports in a typical manner without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
