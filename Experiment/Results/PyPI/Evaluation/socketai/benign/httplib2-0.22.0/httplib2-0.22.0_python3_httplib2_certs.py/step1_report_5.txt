  "purpose": "Utilities for certificate management, specifically to determine the location of CA certificates.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'HTTPLIB2_CA_CERTS', imports from 'certifi' and 'ca_certs_locater' modules.",
  "sinks": "Return values for certificate file paths; no direct data leakage or untrusted data processing beyond file path retrieval.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check -> custom CA locator module -> certifi module -> default certs file.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard pattern for configurable CA bundle retrieval with fallback options.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for a user-specified CA bundle via an environment variable, then falls back to optional external modules, and finally defaults to a bundled certificate file. It handles missing modules gracefully and raises an error if the environment variable points to an invalid file. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code's purpose is configuration and path resolution for CA certificates. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for locating CA certificate files with proper fallbacks and error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
