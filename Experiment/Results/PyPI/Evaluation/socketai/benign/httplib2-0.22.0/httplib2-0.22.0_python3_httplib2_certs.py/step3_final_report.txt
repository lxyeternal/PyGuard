  "purpose": "Utility for locating CA certificate files via environment variables, optional modules, or default paths.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'HTTPLIB2_CA_CERTS', optional modules 'certifi' and 'ca_certs_locater', local 'cacerts.txt' file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code only reads environment variables and files, with validation.",
  "flows": "Environment variable -> file validation -> fallback to modules -> default path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward logic, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for an environment variable pointing to a CA bundle, validates its existence, then falls back to optional modules or a default file. It performs standard environment handling, optional import patterns, and file path resolution. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The environment variable is validated for correctness, and the fallback mechanisms are safe. The code is simple, with no network activity or data leaks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for CA certificate management with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
