  "purpose": "Utilities for certificate management, specifically locating CA bundle files.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'HTTPLIB2_CA_CERTS', imports from 'certifi' and 'ca_certs_locater' modules, __file__ directory.",
  "sinks": "Return value of 'where()' function, which provides file paths for CA certificates.",
  "flows": "The code reads the 'HTTPLIB2_CA_CERTS' environment variable as a source; then, based on availability, it chooses between environment variable, custom CA locator, certifi's CA bundle, or a default file path.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no data exfiltration, and no backdoors observed. The code simply determines the file path for CA certificates based on available sources.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import optional modules 'certifi' and 'ca_certs_locater' without raising errors if missing. It defines a default CA cert path relative to the script. The 'where()' function prioritizes the environment variable 'HTTPLIB2_CA_CERTS', verifies its validity, and falls back to other sources accordingly. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no network activity or data leakage mechanisms. The code performs a straightforward configuration task securely.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a safe utility for locating CA certificate files. It uses standard practices for optional module imports, environment variable configuration, and file path handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
