  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing and locating CA certificate files for SSL/TLS verification.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'HTTPLIB2_CA_CERTS', local file system, imported modules 'certifi' and 'ca_certs_locater'.",
  "sinks": "Return paths for CA certificates; no data is transmitted or written elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Environment variable is checked first, then 'ca_certs_locater' module, then 'certifi', finally default built-in path.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; standard environment variable checks, imports, and file path handling. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to locate CA certificate files for SSL/TLS verification. It conditionally imports modules 'certifi' and 'ca_certs_locater', with fallbacks. The 'where' function prioritizes a user-specified environment variable, then uses available modules, or defaults to a local 'cacerts.txt' file. No suspicious or malicious behavior, no network activity, and no data leaks are present. The code is straightforward and intended for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for managing CA certificate paths with no malicious intent or security risks. It handles environment configurations and module fallbacks responsibly.",
