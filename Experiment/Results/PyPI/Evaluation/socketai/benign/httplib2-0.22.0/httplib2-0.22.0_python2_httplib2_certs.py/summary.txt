  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for CA certificate path resolution. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The environment variable usage is typical and not inherently dangerous. All security and malware scores should be set to 0, with a very low risk score (around 0.1) to account for environment variable reliance, which is standard in configuration code."
