  "sources": "Environment variable HTTPLIB2_CA_CERTS, imports from certifi and ca_certs_locater modules.",
  "sinks": "Returning file paths for CA certificates, potential exceptions if environment variable is invalid.",
  "flows": "Environment variable HTTPLIB2_CA_CERTS -> where() function -> returns valid file path.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code; code is straightforward and used for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to locate a CA bundle file from various sources: an environment variable, a custom module, certifi package, or default built-in path. It validates the environment variable path before using it, raising an error if invalid. Imports are conditional and do not appear malicious. No data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The code is focused on configuration and path resolution for CA certificates, with no suspicious or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for managing certificate paths, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs environment checks and module imports safely and appropriately.",
