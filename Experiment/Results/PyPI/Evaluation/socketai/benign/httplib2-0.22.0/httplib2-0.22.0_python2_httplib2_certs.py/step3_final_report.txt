  "purpose": "Utilities for certificate management.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'HTTPLIB2_CA_CERTS', optional modules 'certifi' and 'ca_certs_locater', and the local 'cacerts.txt' file.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variable -> checks file existence -> calls optional module functions -> falls back to default path.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward logic with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured utility for locating CA certificate files, with environment variable override, optional module imports, and fallback paths. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or network activity is present. The environment variable 'HTTPLIB2_CA_CERTS' is used for configuration, which is standard practice. The code's flow is clear, and all dependencies are optional. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The code's purpose is benign, and the logic is safe and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for CA certificate path resolution. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The environment variable usage is typical and not inherently dangerous. All security and malware scores should be set to 0, with a very low risk score (around 0.1) to account for environment variable reliance, which is standard in configuration code.",
