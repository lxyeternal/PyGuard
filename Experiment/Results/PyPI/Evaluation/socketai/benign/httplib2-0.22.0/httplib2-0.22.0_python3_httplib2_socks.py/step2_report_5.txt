  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the logical consistency, the presence of malicious or suspicious behavior, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Inputs/Outputs:** Describes a SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP. Inputs include user credentials, proxy address, and destination info. Outputs are socket connections, proxy negotiation data, and credentials encoded in base64.\n\n- **Analysis & Findings:**  \n  - Implements standard proxy negotiation protocols.  \n  - Credentials are encoded with base64 for Basic Auth, which is standard.  \n  - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.  \n  - No data exfiltration or malicious network activity evident.  \n  - The code's logic aligns with typical proxy client implementations.\n\n- **Conclusion & Scores:**  \n  - The overall assessment of benign behavior and correctness is consistent.  \n  - Malware score: 0 (no malicious code).  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation).  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 seems reasonable given the handling of credentials over potentially insecure channels but not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Inputs/Outputs:** Similar proxy support with focus on proxy negotiation and credential handling.\n\n- **Analysis & Findings:**  \n  - Properly manages proxy negotiation, encoding credentials with base64, standard for Basic Auth.  \n  - No hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors.  \n  - No obfuscation or hidden code.  \n  - The flow and logic are consistent with standard proxy libraries.\n\n- **Conclusion & Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0, consistent with benign code.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2, aligned with handling credentials over insecure channels.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Inputs/Outputs:** Proxy connection handler supporting SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP.\n\n- **Analysis & Findings:**  \n  - Implements standard negotiation, including credential encoding with base64.  \n  - No hardcoded credentials or malicious code.  \n  - No obfuscation or suspicious logic.  \n  - Handles credentials securely in transit, though over unencrypted channels, which is typical for proxy auth.\n\n- **Conclusion & Scores:**  \n  - The assessment aligns with the code's behavior.  \n  - Malware: 0.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Inputs/Outputs:** Similar proxy connection support, with focus on negotiation and credential handling.\n\n- **Analysis & Findings:**  \n  - Standard proxy negotiation, encoding credentials with base64.  \n  - No hardcoded credentials or malicious intent.  \n  - No obfuscation.  \n  - Functionality appears legitimate.\n\n- **Conclusion & Scores:**  \n  - Consistent with benign, standard proxy client code.  \n  - Malware: 0.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.  \n  - Security risk: 0.1 (lower, possibly due to the handling of credentials).\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Inputs/Outputs:** Proxy connection implementation with credential handling.\n\n- **Analysis & Findings:**  \n  - Uses base64 encoding for credentials, standard for Basic Auth.  \n  - No hardcoded credentials or malicious code.  \n  - No obfuscation or hidden behaviors.  \n  - Transmitting credentials over unencrypted channels is a known risk but not malicious.\n\n- **Conclusion & Scores:**  \n  - The assessment is consistent.  \n  - Malware: 0.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2, acknowledging the potential risk of credentials over insecure channels.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, standard implementation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The main concern is handling credentials over unencrypted channels, which is inherent to proxy protocols like HTTP Basic Auth. The scores of 0.2 are consistent across reports, reflecting a moderate security concern but not an active threat.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard handling of credentials over potentially insecure channels)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. The code is a standard, legitimate proxy client implementation with no malicious intent. The scores reflect reasonable security considerations.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed.",
