  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward implementation of a proxy client supporting SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) are justified and appropriate."
