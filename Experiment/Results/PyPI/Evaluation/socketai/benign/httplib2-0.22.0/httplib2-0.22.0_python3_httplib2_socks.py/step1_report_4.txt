{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python module for establishing socket connections through various proxy types, including SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP proxies, enabling tunneling and proxy support for network connections.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from function parameters, class attributes (__proxy, headers), and network responses during negotiation (e.g., proxy server responses, HTTP status lines).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to network sockets during proxy negotiations, including authentication headers, connection requests, and HTTP requests; also encodes credentials in base64 for proxy authentication.",
  "flows": "Configuration data (proxy type, address, credentials) flows into proxy setup methods; during connection, data flows from client to proxy server (authentication, connection requests), and responses flow back from the proxy to determine success or failure.",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64 encoding for credentials, which is standard; no hardcoded credentials are present. No unusual or obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious variable names. The code appears to follow standard proxy negotiation protocols without malicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a SOCKS and HTTP proxy client, handling multiple proxy types with negotiation and authentication mechanisms. It encodes credentials securely in base64, manages socket connections properly, and includes error handling. No signs of hidden backdoors, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration are evident. The code does not contain any obfuscation, misleading logic, or covert channels. Its structure aligns with typical proxy client libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of a proxy socket interface with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It handles proxy negotiations properly, manages credentials securely, and does not perform any unauthorized or harmful actions. There are no indicators of malware or sabotage.",
