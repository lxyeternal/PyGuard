{
  "purpose": "The code implements a SOCKS/HTTP proxy client supporting SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP tunneling, facilitating proxy negotiation and credential handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for proxy configuration (proxy type, address, port, credentials), and network data during negotiation and connection establishment.",
  "sinks": "Network communication during proxy negotiation, sending credentials encoded in base64, and HTTP headers for tunneling.",
  "flows": "Credential encoding and transmission during SOCKS5 authentication, HTTP header construction, and connection negotiation sequences for SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP proxies.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for Basic Auth is standard; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard protocols for proxy negotiation, properly encodes credentials, and manages connection flows without malicious or obfuscated elements. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The main security concern is transmitting credentials over unencrypted channels, which is inherent to HTTP Basic Auth but not a flaw in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward implementation of a proxy client supporting SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
