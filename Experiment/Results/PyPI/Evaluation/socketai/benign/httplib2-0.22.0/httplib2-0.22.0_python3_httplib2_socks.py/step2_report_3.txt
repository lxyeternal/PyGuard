  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and determine if the concerns are valid, if the scoring is appropriate, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code implements standard SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP proxy negotiation protocols.\n- Proxy credentials are handled via parameters, encoded with base64 for HTTP Basic Auth, which is standard.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are evident.\n- The code relies on user-supplied data; no signs of malicious payloads or backdoors.\n- The security risks identified are primarily related to transmitting credentials over unencrypted channels, which is inherent to HTTP Basic Auth, not specific to this code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**  \nProvides a standard SOCKS proxy client with proper error handling and support for SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code matches the description; no malicious or obfuscated code present.  \n- The risk score is low, considering the potential exposure when used over insecure channels, but that is an external concern, not a code flaw.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**  \nFocuses on proxy negotiation, handling credentials, and connection setup. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code handles credentials securely during negotiation; no hardcoded secrets.  \n- No obfuscation or malicious logic.  \n- The risk score reflects typical proxy handling over insecure channels, which is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are justified and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**  \nDetails the proxy connection process, including encoding credentials and negotiation. No malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code's behavior aligns with standard proxy client implementations.  \n- No malicious indicators.  \n- The risk is mainly from transmitting credentials over insecure channels, which is inherent to HTTP Basic Auth, not the code.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**  \nAgain, describes standard proxy connection procedures, handling credentials and negotiation. No malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Slightly lower risk score, possibly reflecting confidence that the code is benign and that the main concern is external (e.g., unencrypted credentials).  \n- The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**  \nHighlights the use of base64 encoding for credentials and potential exposure over insecure channels, but no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The concern about transmitting credentials over HTTP (not HTTPS) is valid but external to the code itself.  \n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Final Justification**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's content—no malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The main concern is transmitting credentials over unencrypted channels (HTTP proxy), which is a known security issue but not a code flaw. The scores (0.1–0.2) reflect this appropriately.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Assessment**\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Risk Score:** **0.2** (consistent with the inherent risks of proxy authentication over insecure channels)\n\n**Note:**  \nThe code itself appears to be a legitimate, standard SOCKS/HTTP proxy client implementation. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The primary security concern is external—use over insecure channels—rather than a flaw within the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate scoring. No modifications or flagging for malicious activity are warranted.",
