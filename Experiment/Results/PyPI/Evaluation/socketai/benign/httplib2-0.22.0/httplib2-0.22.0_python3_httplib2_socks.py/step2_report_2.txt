  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of malicious or suspicious elements, and ensuring the scoring aligns with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard proxy connection setup, user inputs, proxy credentials.\n- **Sinks:** Sending negotiation commands, credentials (via base64), HTTP headers.\n- **Flow:** Typical proxy negotiation, data flows during connection establishment.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of base64 encoding for Basic Auth is standard; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Implements standard SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP protocols correctly. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration evident.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate proxy client code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, due to credential handling). This is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Proxy support, configuration parameters.\n- **Sinks:** Network communication, encoding credentials.\n- **Flow:** Standard negotiation flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; credentials are encoded but not stored maliciously.\n- **Analysis:** Standard protocol implementation, no malicious actions or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate proxy handling library.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Proxy configuration, connection parameters.\n- **Sinks:** Sends credentials, headers, negotiation data.\n- **Flow:** Proper negotiation sequences.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses base64 encoding, which is normal for Basic Auth; no hardcoded credentials.\n- **Analysis:** Standard implementation, no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores align.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Proxy support, configuration, and connection.\n- **Sinks:** Network data, credentials encoding.\n- **Flow:** Standard proxy negotiation.\n- **Anomalies:** Base64 encoding for credentials, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis:** Typical proxy client logic, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Proxy connection, credential transmission.\n- **Sinks:** Sends credentials via Base64, network connections.\n- **Flow:** Standard negotiation, credential handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Base64 encoding for Basic Auth, which is normal; no hardcoded credentials.\n- **Analysis:** Standard proxy client, no malicious intent. The main security concern is transmitting credentials over unencrypted channels, but that’s a general risk, not specific to this code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate standard, legitimate proxy code with no malicious payloads or behaviors. **Set to 0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected in any report. **Set to 0**.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero, reflecting the handling of credentials and network operations, but nothing malicious. **0.1–0.2** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**     | **0**       | **0.1** |\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-implemented proxy client supporting SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP. It handles credentials securely in transit (using base64 for Basic Auth), with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious activity. The low risk score reflects typical concerns about credential transmission over insecure channels but does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Final note:** Always recommend using encrypted channels (e.g., HTTPS, TLS) for transmitting credentials to mitigate risks, but this is outside the scope of the code itself.",
