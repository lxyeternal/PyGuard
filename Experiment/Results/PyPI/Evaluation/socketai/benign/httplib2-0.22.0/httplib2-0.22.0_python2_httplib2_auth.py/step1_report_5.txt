{
  "purpose": "The code parses HTTP authentication headers according to RFC standards, extracting parameters and schemes for authentication purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'headers' dictionary, specifically the 'authentication-info' and 'www-authenticate' header fields.",
  "sinks": "Processes and parses header string data; no direct data sinks that leak information or execute untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "Headers are retrieved and parsed via regular expressions and the pyparsing library; parsed data is returned as dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. Usage of regex and parsing libraries is standard. No suspicious code flows or obfuscation patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses regex and the pyparsing library to parse HTTP authentication headers following RFC 7235 and RFC 7615 standards. It carefully handles exceptions, raising specific errors for malformed headers. The functions extract parameters and authentication schemes without executing untrusted data beyond parsing. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration are evident. The code appears designed for standard parsing tasks without malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard parsing of HTTP authentication headers with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, with proper error handling, and does not contain suspicious patterns or backdoors.",
