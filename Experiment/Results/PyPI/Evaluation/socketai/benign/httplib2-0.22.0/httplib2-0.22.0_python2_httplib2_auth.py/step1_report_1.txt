{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse HTTP authentication headers, specifically 'WWW-Authenticate' and 'Authentication-Info' headers, to extract relevant authentication parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads header strings from a dictionary input, specifically 'headers.get(headername)' for 'www-authenticate' and 'authentication-info'.",
  "sinks": "No dangerous sinks such as system commands, network transmissions, or data exfiltration functions are present. The code solely parses strings into structured data.",
  "flows": "Input headers are retrieved, parsed with pyparsing into structured dictionaries, and returned. No untrusted data is written to external systems or used in insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses regex for unquoting and relies on pyparsing for string parsing, which is standard. No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. No dynamic code execution or network calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code employs regex and pyparsing to parse specific header formats according to RFC standards. It correctly handles malformed headers with exception raising. It does not perform any system modifications, network activity, or data exfiltration. No anomalous or malicious patterns are evident. The functions only process header strings into dictionaries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for parsing HTTP authentication headers with no malicious intent. It is well-structured, with proper error handling, and does not include any suspicious or malicious behaviors. The overall security risk is negligible.",
