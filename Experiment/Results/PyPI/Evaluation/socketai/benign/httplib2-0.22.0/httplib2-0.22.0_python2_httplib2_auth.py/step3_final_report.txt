  "purpose": "Parse HTTP 'WWW-Authenticate' and 'Authentication-Info' headers into structured data using regex and pyparsing.",
  "sources": "Input header strings from headers.get(headername, \"\")",
  "sinks": "None; data is processed into dictionaries, no external or untrusted system actions",
  "flows": "Header string -> parseString -> structured dictionary",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward RFC-compliant parsing with proper error handling",
  "analysis": "The code employs regex for unquoting and pyparsing for tokenizing and parsing headers according to RFC standards. It handles errors gracefully by raising MalformedHeader exceptions. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behaviors are present. The functions only process input headers into structured data, with no side effects or network activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, RFC-compliant parser for HTTP authentication headers, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correct. No adjustments are necessary.",
