{
  "purpose": "Provides proxy support (SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP) for Python sockets, enabling tunneling through proxies with credential handling.",
  "sources": "Reads proxy configuration parameters, credentials, and destination address/port during connection setup.",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations during proxy negotiation and connection establishment.",
  "flows": "Proxy parameters influence connection routines; credentials used during SOCKS5 authentication; data flows during negotiation and connection requests.",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64.b64encode(auth) without decoding to string in __getauthheader(), which may cause runtime errors but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of proxy support, handling SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP proxies. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Minor bugs exist (e.g., encoding handling), but these do not indicate malicious intent. The proxy capabilities could be exploited if misused, but the code itself is legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard proxy client implementation with no malicious or obfuscated components. Its potential for misuse is inherent to proxy tools but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.2).",
