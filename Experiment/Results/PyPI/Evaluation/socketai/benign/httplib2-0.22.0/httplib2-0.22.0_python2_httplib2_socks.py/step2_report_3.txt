  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard proxy module supporting SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Proxy configuration and destination info flow into connection and negotiation routines; data transmitted over socket during proxy negotiation.\n- Anomalies: Uses standard ports; credentials are base64-encoded but handled normally; no hardcoded secrets.\n- Analysis: Implements typical proxy negotiation logic without obfuscation or malicious payloads. Credentials are handled securely in memory; no signs of malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, standard proxy code. Malware score: 0. Justified, as there's no malicious behavior. Risk score: 0.2 seems appropriate, reflecting low security risk.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar proxy support with socket wrapping.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Proxy parameters influence connection; network responses processed during negotiation.\n- Anomalies: Uses outdated practices like 'basestring' (Python 2), and encoding credentials with encode() without explicit encoding (defaults to utf-8). No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Standard proxy logic; minor code issues but no malicious intent. No suspicious data flows.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate proxy implementation. Malware score: 0.0. Justified. Risk: 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Proxy tunneling support.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Proxy config affects network negotiation; data flows during connection setup.\n- Anomalies: Uses base64 encoding for credentials without decoding, which is a bug but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Functionally standard; no malicious behavior. Minor bug in encoding, but security-wise benign.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, standard code. Malware: 0.0. justified. Risk: 0.2 is appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: SOCKS proxy support.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Proxy and destination info influence network data exchange.\n- Anomalies: Similar base64 encoding issue without decoding; no obfuscated or malicious code.\n- Analysis: Standard proxy negotiation routines; no signs of malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate proxy code. Malware: 0.0. justified. Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Proxy tunneling.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Proxy parameters influence network negotiation; data flows during connection.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies; standard handling.\n- Analysis: Well-structured, standard proxy implementation.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior detected. Malware: 0.0. Risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate the code is a standard proxy implementation with no malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The only minor issues are coding bugs (like base64 encoding without decoding) which are not malicious. Therefore, **malware score should be 0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation, encrypted code, or hidden logic detected. The code is straightforward and readable. **Obfuscated score should be 0**.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The code facilitates network tunneling through proxies, which could be exploited for malicious purposes if misused. However, the code itself is not malicious. The risk is low but not zero because of its potential misuse. The reports' risk scores of 0.2 are reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores given in the reports are consistent with the analysis.\n- No modifications needed; the code is a legitimate proxy module with no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis reflects a benign, standard implementation with minimal security concerns, primarily related to potential misuse rather than inherent maliciousness.",
