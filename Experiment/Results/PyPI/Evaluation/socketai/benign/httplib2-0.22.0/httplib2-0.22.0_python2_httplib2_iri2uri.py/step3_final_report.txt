  "purpose": "Convert an IRI to a URI by percent-encoding Unicode characters outside the ASCII range following RFC 3987.",
  "sources": "Input URI string; authority component after urlsplit",
  "sinks": "Reconstructed URI string after encoding",
  "flows": "Input URI -> urlsplit parsing -> encode function for each character -> urlunsplit to reconstruct URI",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'urlparse' module; reliance on 'unicode' type indicating Python 2; no dynamic code execution or external data sources",
  "analysis": "The code parses a Unicode URI, encodes the authority component with IDNA, and percent-encodes characters outside the ASCII range based on specified Unicode ranges. It uses standard modules and follows RFC 3987. No external network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The encoding process is straightforward, and test cases confirm correctness. The use of 'unicode' suggests Python 2, which may affect compatibility but not security. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for converting IRIs to URIs, with no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities identified. It correctly applies RFC 3987 rules and passes validation tests. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily due to version compatibility considerations.",
