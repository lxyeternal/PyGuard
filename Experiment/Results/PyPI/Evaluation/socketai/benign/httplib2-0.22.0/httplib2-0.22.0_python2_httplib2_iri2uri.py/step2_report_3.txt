  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present in code?** No. The code appears to function as intended for IRI to URI conversion.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None detected. The logic aligns with RFC 3987, and the test cases validate correctness.\n- **Scores?** Malware score: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — reasonable for a benign utility.\n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?** Not applicable; scores are low.\n- **Potential assumptions?** The report assumes correctness based on code inspection, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The code is a standard, safe implementation.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — consistent.\n- **Potential issues?** No, the logic is straightforward, and no external threats are indicated.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility, no security concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: standard IRI to URI conversion, proper encoding.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — justified.\n- **Potential assumptions?** The report correctly notes no external data or network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar findings; the code is a typical implementation.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Note:** Uses Python 2 syntax ('unicode'), but this does not imply malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous assessments; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports agree that the code correctly implements IRI to URI conversion following RFC 3987.\n- **Malware risk:** All scores are zero, and no suspicious behavior or malicious patterns are evident.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, given the nature of the utility.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to the use of Python 2 syntax, which could pose maintainability issues but not security risks.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- The code relies on the deprecated 'urlparse' module in Python 2, which could be a maintenance concern but not a security threat.\n- No external data, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The purpose is a utility function for encoding, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports collectively indicate that this is a benign, standard utility for converting IRIs to URIs. The scores assigned are appropriate, and there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects the benign nature of the code and its intended purpose.",
