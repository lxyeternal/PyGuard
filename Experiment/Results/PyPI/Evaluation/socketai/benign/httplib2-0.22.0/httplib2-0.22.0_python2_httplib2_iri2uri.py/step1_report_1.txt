{
  "purpose": "Convert an Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) to a standard URI by encoding special Unicode characters according to RFC 3987.",
  "sources": "The function iri2uri reads input in the form of a Unicode string (URI or IRI). The input is passed directly to the function, with no external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "The code encodes characters within the URI, particularly in the authority component and other parts, but does not send data externally or to network destinations. No external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input (IRI as Unicode string) -> Passed to iri2uri -> Encoded through encode() for specific Unicode ranges -> Reconstructed URI string with percent-encoded characters.",
  "anomalies": "The encode() function encodes characters in specified Unicode ranges but does not appear to encode characters outside those ranges. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. Use of urlparse module is standard for URI manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The script correctly converts IRIs to URIs by encoding characters outside the ASCII range per RFC 3987. It uses standard Python modules (urlparse) and Unicode handling. The encode() function only encodes characters within certain Unicode ranges, which aligns with the RFC rules. No external network calls, data leaks, or suspicious code are detected. The inclusion of test cases suggests proper testing but no malicious intent. The code structure and comments are clear, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for converting IRIs to URIs, following RFC 3987. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are observed. It is a legitimate utility script with no security risks detected.",
