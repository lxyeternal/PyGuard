  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for converting IRIs to URIs, with no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities identified. It correctly applies RFC 3987 rules and passes validation tests. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily due to version compatibility considerations."
