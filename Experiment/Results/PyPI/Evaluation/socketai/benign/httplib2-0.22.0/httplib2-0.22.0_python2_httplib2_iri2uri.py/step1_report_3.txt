  "purpose": "Convert IRIs to URIs by percent-encoding characters outside the ASCII range and applying IDNA encoding to domain parts.",
  "sources": "Input URI string passed to iri2uri function, specifically the 'uri' parameter, and parts of the URI obtained via urlsplit.",
  "sinks": "Encoded URI string returned by iri2uri; potential injection or data leakage is minimal since encoding is applied for valid URI formatting, no untrusted data execution occurs.",
  "flows": "Input URI -> urlsplit parsing -> authority IDNA encoding -> encoding of characters outside allowed ranges -> reassembly of URI with urlunsplit -> return encoded URI.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. The encode() function uses percent-encoding based on Unicode code points; no obfuscation or suspicious control flows are evident. The code appears standard for IRI to URI conversion.",
  "analysis": "The script implements a standard conversion of IRIs to URIs, including percent-encoding of non-ASCII characters based on Unicode ranges specified in RFC 3987. The use of urlparse.urlsplit and urlparse.urlunsplit aligns with correct URI handling. Encoding is done per character with a range check, and IDNA encoding is correctly applied to the authority component. The test suite validates idempotence and correct encoding for various IRIs. No suspicious or malicious code is present, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code’s purpose is to normalize URIs, with no malicious intent apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-implemented IRI to URI converter with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. It performs expected URI normalization without dangerous side effects.",
