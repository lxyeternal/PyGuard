  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'httplib2' Python package, handling package configuration, testing, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements files, importing standard modules, package setup configuration",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling points that could be exploited",
  "flows": "No malicious data flow from sources to sinks; standard package setup process",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks using setuptools. It defines a custom test command using pytest, reads dependency files, and configures package metadata. All operations are standard and do not exhibit signs of malicious behavior. There are no external data inputs or outputs that could be exploited maliciously. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign and standard setup script for a Python package, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
