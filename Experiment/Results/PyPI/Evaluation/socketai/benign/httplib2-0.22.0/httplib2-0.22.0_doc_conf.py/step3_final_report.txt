{
  "purpose": "This code is a static configuration file for Sphinx documentation build, setting project info, paths, and formatting options.",
  "sources": "Import of 'sys' (unused), assignment of configuration variables such as 'templates_path', 'source_suffix', 'project', 'version', 'release', etc.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output or external operations.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of configuration parameters; no runtime data flow or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration script for Sphinx documentation. It imports 'sys' but does not use it, which is harmless. All variables are assigned static values related to project info and formatting. There are no dynamic operations, external data handling, network calls, or code execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or supply chain attack vectors are present. The code's benign nature is consistent with the scores assigned in the reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
