  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a static configuration file for Sphinx documentation.\n- The code only imports 'sys' but does not use it, which is harmless.\n- There are no dynamic operations, external data handling, network calls, or execution of untrusted code.\n- The configuration involves setting static variables, paths, and project info.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The code is entirely benign and typical for such configuration files.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**1. Malware Score Justification:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or payloads.\n\n**2. Obfuscated Score:**\n- All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n**3. Security Risk Score:**\n- All reports assign 0, which is justified given the static, read-only nature of the code.\n\n**4. Logical Flaws or Errors in Reports:**\n- No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The reasoning is consistent and aligns with the code content.\n\n**5. Scoring Consistency:**\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Given the evidence:**\n- The code is a straightforward, static configuration script.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure elements are present.\n- The import of 'sys' is unused but harmless.\n- The configuration does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could pose security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. They correctly identify the benign nature of the code, and their scores reflect that. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final verdict:**\n- The code is entirely safe.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that configuration files remain static and free of embedded secrets or code injection, but in this case, everything appears standard and safe.",
