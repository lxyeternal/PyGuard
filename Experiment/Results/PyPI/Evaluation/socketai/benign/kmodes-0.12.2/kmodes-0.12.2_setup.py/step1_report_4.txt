  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'kmodes' Python package including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long description; importing 'kmodes' module for version information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution, external calls, or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.rst' -> importing 'kmodes' -> using package metadata in setup()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: importing modules, reading a README file, and calling setuptools.setup() with package info, dependencies, and classifiers. The 'kmodes' module is imported solely to retrieve its version attribute; the file read is straightforward and not malicious. No dynamic execution, network operations, or credential handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
