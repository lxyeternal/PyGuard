  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'kmodes' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long description; importing 'kmodes' module to access '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leakage points; no external data outputs or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Reading README -> importing kmodes to get version -> setup configuration using package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and a local module 'kmodes'. It reads a README file for package description and retrieves version info from the module. The setup() function configures package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All actions are typical for Python package setup files. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or hidden behaviors are present. The code adheres to standard practices and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It correctly reads package info and dependencies without performing any suspicious operations.",
