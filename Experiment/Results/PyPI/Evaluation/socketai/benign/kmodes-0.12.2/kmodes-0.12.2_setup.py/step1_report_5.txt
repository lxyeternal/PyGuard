  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the kmodes Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long description, importing kmodes module to get version.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads local README file; accesses kmodes module version; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports a module to retrieve its version, reads a local README file, and configures package setup metadata and dependencies. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. The dependencies are standard scientific Python packages. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard package setup for the kmodes project with no malicious or security concerns detected.",
