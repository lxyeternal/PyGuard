  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'kmodes' Python package including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file; importing the kmodes module to access its __version__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling points; no network, file writing, or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file, then using the kmodes module's __version__ attribute to set the package version.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: importing modules, reading a README file, and calling setup() with metadata. It references kmodes.__version__ for versioning, which is a typical practice. No user input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. All dependencies are standard and necessary for the package functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
