  "purpose": "The code initializes centroids for clustering algorithms using two different methods: Huang (1997) and Cao et al. (2009).",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the variable X, which is assumed to be a NumPy array with data points.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks that lead to data leakage or malicious data exfiltration; the code only performs centroid initialization.",
  "flows": "Input data X flows into the functions, influencing centroid selection based on dissimilarity, density, and sampling. No external or untrusted data is used beyond the provided dataset.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. It uses standard Python and NumPy functions, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two centroid initialization functions for clustering algorithms, utilizing standard data processing, sampling, and mathematical operations. The first method samples initial centroids based on attribute value distributions, and the second method selects centroids based on density and dissimilarity metrics. Both functions perform standard data analysis procedures without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, external network calls, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of centroid initialization methods for clustering algorithms. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It operates solely on the provided dataset with standard Python and NumPy functions.",
