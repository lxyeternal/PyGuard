{
  "purpose": "The code defines a wrapper class for functions, adding descriptive metadata for debugging or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as there are no input/output operations or data handling beyond internal function calls.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard Python features, including inspect for call stack inspection. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The class '_named_check' encapsulates a function, storing a descriptive string based on the call stack, the function's name, and provided argument text. It is designed solely for enhancing debugging or logging by attaching context. The code uses standard Python library functions without executing external or untrusted code. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The purpose appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for wrapping functions with descriptive metadata. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior concerns.",
