{
  "purpose": "The code defines a wrapper class for checks, providing descriptive context for functions used as checks.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reads; only internal class and function definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the class wraps existing functions without processing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a class _named_check that wraps a check function, adding descriptive metadata based on the caller's stack frame. It uses inspect.stack() to generate a description string, then calls the wrapped function. There are no external data inputs, no network operations, no environment variable use, and no suspicious logic. The code appears to be purely for logging or documentation purposes, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for enhancing the readability and traceability of check functions. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
