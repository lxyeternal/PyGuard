  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward utility class for wrapping functions with descriptive metadata.\n- No external data sources, network operations, or data handling are involved.\n- The use of `inspect.stack()` is standard for debugging purposes.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose is benign: debugging, logging, or documentation.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the straightforward implementation.\n- The security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only minor point is the use of `inspect.stack()`, which, if misused elsewhere, could leak sensitive call stack information. However, in this context, it's used solely for descriptive purposes, not for sensitive data extraction.\n- No actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are indicated or implied.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign utility for debugging or logging.\n- The provided scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis code is a standard, safe debugging utility with no security concerns.",
