{
  "purpose": "A utility class to wrap a check function and provide a descriptive string for debugging or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it inspects the call stack to generate descriptions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only wraps and annotates a function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of 'inspect' is standard for introspection.",
  "analysis": "The class _named_check stores a function and creates a descriptive string using the call stack. It relies on 'inspect' for debugging information and does not perform any network, file, or sensitive data operations. The code appears to be purely for debugging or documentation purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for enhancing debug or logging output. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
