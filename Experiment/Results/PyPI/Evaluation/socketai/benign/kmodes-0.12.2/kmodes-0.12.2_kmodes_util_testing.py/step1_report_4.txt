{
  "purpose": "This code defines a wrapper class for check functions, providing descriptive metadata for debugging or reporting purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it inspects the call stack to generate descriptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the only flow is within the class methods, which do not handle external data insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior, are present. The code uses `inspect.stack()` for runtime introspection but in a safe manner.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class `_named_check` that wraps a check function, storing a descriptive string about its call context. It uses `inspect.stack()` to capture the caller's information, which is safe. The class's methods are straightforward and do not perform any malicious actions or insecure operations. No external data handling, no network activity, no credential handling, and no obfuscation are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility class used for descriptive purposes in testing or validation. It does not contain malicious behavior, pose security risks, or perform any suspicious operations.",
