{
  "purpose": "A utility class that wraps a function to add descriptive debugging or logging information based on call context.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it uses inspect.stack() internally to obtain call stack information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process or output external data.",
  "flows": "The code captures call stack info via inspect.stack() during initialization, then stores and invokes the wrapped function; no external data flow or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, uses standard Python introspection, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class _named_check that wraps a function, generating a descriptive string based on the caller's context using inspect.stack(). It is intended for debugging or logging purposes. There are no external inputs, no network or file operations, and no malicious or suspicious behavior. The use of inspect.stack() is standard and safe in this context. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The code is a simple utility with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign debugging utility that wraps functions with descriptive context. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
