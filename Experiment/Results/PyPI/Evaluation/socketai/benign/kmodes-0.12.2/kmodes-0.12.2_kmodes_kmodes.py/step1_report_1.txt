  "purpose": "Implementation of the k-modes clustering algorithm for categorical data, including various initialization methods, iterative optimization, and prediction capabilities.",
  "sources": "Data inputs from X (training data), sample_weight (optional), and initialization parameters (init).",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly send data over the network, write to system files, or execute system commands. No apparent data leakage or privacy violations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input X and sample_weight into clustering functions, where it influences centroid calculations, label assignments, and cost evaluation. No external or untrusted data sources or sinks are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated logic, or suspicious dynamic code execution. All functions perform standard clustering operations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of the k-modes clustering algorithm with multiple initialization options, iterative refinement, and parallel execution support. It uses numpy and scikit-learn utilities for data validation and processing. The logic appears transparent, with no signs of malicious code, network communication, or data exfiltration. It includes typical validation and error handling for inputs. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected within this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate implementation of the k-modes clustering algorithm with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs clustering tasks with standard methods and safeguards. There are no indications of malware or security risks.",
