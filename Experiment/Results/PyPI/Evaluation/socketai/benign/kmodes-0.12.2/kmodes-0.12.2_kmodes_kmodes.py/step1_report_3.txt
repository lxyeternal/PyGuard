  "purpose": "Implementation of the k-modes clustering algorithm for categorical data, including various initialization methods, clustering iterations, and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from standard libraries and local utility modules, class constructors, fit/predict methods, internal clustering functions, and data handling functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code performs clustering computations and data transformations but does not contain code that writes untrusted data, accesses network, or interacts with system components maliciously.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables (X, sample_weight) through encoding, clustering, and centroid updates, returning cluster labels and centroids. No external untrusted data or command execution flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Use of standard machine learning and clustering logic. No signs of malicious backdoors, data exfiltration, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of the k-modes clustering algorithm for categorical data. It uses known initialization methods, parallel execution for multiple runs, and updates cluster centroids based on attribute modes. The code includes input validation and data encoding functions, but no network activity, system modifications, or suspicious data handling routines are present. The utility functions and class methods follow typical design patterns for clustering algorithms. There are no anomalies suggesting malicious intent, such as code injection, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration. The functions operate solely within the scope of clustering tasks, and all data transformations are deterministic or controlled.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate clustering implementation with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs standard data clustering tasks securely and transparently. No security risks or malware signals were detected.",
