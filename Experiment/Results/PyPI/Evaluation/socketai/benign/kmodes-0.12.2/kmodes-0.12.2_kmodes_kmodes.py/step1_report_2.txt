  "purpose": "Implementation of the k-modes clustering algorithm for categorical data, including initialization, iteration, and prediction functions.",
  "sources": "Input data (X), random seed (random_state), sample_weight, initialization parameters, and internal functions that encode features and compute dissimilarities.",
  "sinks": "Predictions in predict() that output labels; calculations of dissimilarities and cluster assignments.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from fit() into encode_features(), then through clustering iterations; prediction flows from encoded centroids and data points to label output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. External utility functions imported from .util suggest modular design, no inline suspicious code. No network communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of the k-modes clustering algorithm for categorical data. It uses typical data validation, flexible initialization options, parallel computation support, and appropriate use of numpy and scikit-learn utilities. The functions handle clustering logic, centroid updating, and label prediction securely. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data theft, or hidden backdoors. The code is well-structured, with clear parameter validation and modular functions. External utilities are used for encoding features and computing dissimilarities, which appear to be legitimate. No hardcoded secrets, environment variable misuse, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, open-source clustering implementation with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs clustering on categorical data securely and transparently. The overall security risk is low.",
