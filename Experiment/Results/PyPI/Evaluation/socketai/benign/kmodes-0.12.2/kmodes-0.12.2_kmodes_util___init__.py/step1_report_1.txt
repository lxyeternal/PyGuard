{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for data preprocessing, encoding/decoding features, and handling clustering data.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from numpy arrays and pandas DataFrame objects.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; functions perform data transformations and mappings without outputting untrusted data to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through encoding, decoding, and utility functions but no external network or system actions are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets detected. Functions perform standard data processing tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code includes typical data manipulation functions: converting pandas to numpy, encoding categorical features, decoding centroids, retrieving max keys, and extracting unique rows. All operations involve data transformations without external interactions, network activities, or insecure practices. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be standard utility functions for clustering data processing. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The code is clean and straightforward, with no external system calls or hidden behaviors.",
