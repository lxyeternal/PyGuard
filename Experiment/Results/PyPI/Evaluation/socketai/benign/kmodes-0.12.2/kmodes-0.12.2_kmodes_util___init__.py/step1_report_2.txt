  "purpose": "Utility functions for data preprocessing, encoding, decoding, and handling clustering operations.",
  "sources": "Input data from user-supplied arrays (e.g., X), dictionary inputs for mappings, class attributes, and internal numpy operations.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly evident; no data is sent over network, written to files, or manipulated in a way that exposes sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through encoding functions, mapping functions, and decoding functions. No external or untrusted sources are directly connected to security-critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. The functions are standard utilities for data transformation, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides typical utility functions used in data processing: converting pandas DataFrames to numpy arrays, encoding categorical features, decoding centroids, retrieving unique rows, and getting maximum values from dictionaries. All functions rely on numpy and pandas data structures, with no external network calls, no hidden code, and no suspicious behavior. The use of np.vectorize, dict comprehensions, and numpy operations are standard. The code appears clean, modular, and purpose-driven for clustering utilities without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, well-structured utility code for clustering data preprocessing. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It is safe for use in a production environment, assuming the user supplies trusted input data.",
