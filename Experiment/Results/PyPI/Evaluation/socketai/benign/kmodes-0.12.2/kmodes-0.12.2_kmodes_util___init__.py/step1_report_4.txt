{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for data processing, encoding/decoding features, and handling clustering data structures.",
  "sources": "Data input occurs in functions pandas_to_numpy (via x.values), encode_features (via X and enc_map), decode_centroids (via encoded array and mapping), get_max_value_key (via dic), get_unique_rows (via array a).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage points are limited to data transformations; no sinks are present that could lead to malicious data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through encoding, decoding, and utility functions with transformations; no external data sinks or network calls involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. Usage of numpy functions and data mappings are standard for data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic utilities for data handling in clustering tasks, including converting pandas DataFrames, encoding categorical features, decoding centroids, and extracting unique rows. No network operations, file I/O, or system calls are present. Functions are standard and well-structured for data processing. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues. The code does not include any external data leaks or backdoors. All functions perform data transformations without side effects. Overall, this code appears safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of utility functions for data processing related to clustering, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is standard, transparent, and focused on data transformations, with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
