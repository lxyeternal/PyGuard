{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for data preprocessing, encoding/decoding, and handling clustering-related data transformations.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input arrays, pandas DataFrame attributes, and dictionary structures.",
  "sinks": "Uses data transformations and numpy operations; no direct output to external systems or networks.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., pandas DataFrame or arrays) → encoding functions → numpy arrays → decoding functions, and vice versa.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The code is straightforward and typical for data preprocessing.",
  "analysis": "The functions handle data conversion, encoding, and decoding, using numpy and pandas. No external data transmissions, network access, or system modifications are present. No obfuscated or unusual code constructs. Functions such as pandas_to_numpy, get_max_value_key, encode_features, decode_centroids, and get_unique_rows are standard for clustering utilities. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of clustering utility functions without malicious intent or security risks. It performs data transformation tasks commonly used in machine learning workflows, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
