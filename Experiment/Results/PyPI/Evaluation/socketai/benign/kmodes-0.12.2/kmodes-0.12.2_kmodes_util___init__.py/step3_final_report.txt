  "purpose": "Utility functions for clustering data processing, including data type conversion, feature encoding/decoding, and array manipulation.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from numpy arrays or pandas DataFrames, particularly in functions like pandas_to_numpy, encode_features, and decode_centroids.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or external effects; functions operate in-memory without external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays/DataFrames through encoding/decoding functions, with mappings used for categorical features, and results returned in numpy array formats.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and standard for data preprocessing.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard data utility functions with no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. Functions handle data conversions, feature encoding/decoding, and array operations using numpy and pandas. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The code is purpose-driven, clean, and safe for production use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is suitable for deployment in clustering workflows. The existing security and malware scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
