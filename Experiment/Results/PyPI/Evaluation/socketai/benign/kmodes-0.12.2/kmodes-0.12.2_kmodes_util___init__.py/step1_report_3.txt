  "purpose": "Utility functions for data processing, encoding, and decoding in clustering algorithms.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: x, dic, X, encoded, mapping, a. Data processing within functions such as reading array data, dictionary keys/values, and array manipulations.",
  "sinks": "Array manipulations and dictionary lookups that could handle untrusted data, but no direct external data sinks or network communication present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through functions, involving encoding, decoding, and array operations, with no external or untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected. The code performs straightforward data transformations.",
  "analysis": "The code contains utility functions for handling data in clustering tasks: converting pandas DataFrames to numpy arrays, extracting maximum values from dictionaries, encoding categorical features, decoding centroids back to original labels, and obtaining unique rows. No external data transmission, network operations, or system modifications are present. The functions perform standard data transformations with no suspicious or malicious behavior. Use of numpy for array processing and dictionary mappings appears typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of harmless utility functions for data encoding and manipulation, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
