{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a k-prototypes clustering algorithm for mixed numerical and categorical data, supporting different initialization methods and dissimilarity functions.",
  "sources": "Data input via function parameters (X), encoding features (encode_features), reading cluster centroids, and reading data for initialization.",
  "sinks": "Return values such as cluster centroids, labels, and cost; no data leaks or untrusted outputs; no network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input X through encoding and splitting, into clustering iterations, with centroid updates and label assignments; no external data transmission or untrusted sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. No use of eval, exec, or obfuscated features. The code strictly implements clustering logic with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard clustering algorithm (k-prototypes), with functions for initialization, iteration, centroid updating, and label assignment. It uses common libraries like numpy, scikit-learn, and joblib for parallelization. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system commands are present. The code does handle input data securely, checks for sparse data, and uses well-defined dissimilarity functions. All operations appear consistent with legitimate clustering procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a clustering algorithm with no indication of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs clustering on data without any suspicious external communication or harmful actions. It appears safe and intended for data analysis purposes.",
