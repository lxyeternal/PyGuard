  "purpose": "Implementation of the k-prototypes clustering algorithm for mixed numerical and categorical data.",
  "sources": "Input data X, optional categorical column indices, sample_weight, random seed",
  "sinks": "None evident; no code explicitly writes to external systems or leaks data",
  "flows": "Input data is split into numerical and categorical parts, used for centroid initialization and iterative clustering updates, with computed costs and labels returned",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code detected; use of standard libraries and functions; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard clustering algorithm for mixed data types, including centroid initialization, iterative cluster assignment, centroid updating, and cost calculation. It uses established methods such as Huang and Cao for initialization, and standard dissimilarity functions. All data manipulations are confined within the clustering context, with no network access, file I/O, or external system interaction evident. No obfuscation or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a k-prototypes clustering algorithm without malicious behavior or security risks. It relies solely on typical data processing and clustering methods with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
