  "purpose": "Implementation of k-prototypes clustering for mixed numerical and categorical data.",
  "sources": "Data input arrays, encoding functions (encode_features, get_max_value_key), and centroid initialization routines.",
  "sinks": "Internal data processing; no external system interactions or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through encoding, clustering iterations, and centroid updates within the clustering routines.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or external system interactions; standard clustering logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of the k-prototypes clustering algorithm, utilizing common libraries and well-understood methods. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external communication are present. Minor security considerations relate to data encoding functions, but these are typical data processing steps without malicious intent. The clustering routines perform expected operations such as centroid initialization, iterative point reassignment, and centroid updates, all consistent with legitimate clustering procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of k-prototypes clustering with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The minor security risk score reflects typical data handling concerns but does not indicate malicious activity.",
