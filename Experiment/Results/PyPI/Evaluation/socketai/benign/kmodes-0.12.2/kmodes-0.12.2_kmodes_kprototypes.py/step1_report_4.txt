  "purpose": "Implementation of the k-prototypes clustering algorithm for mixed numerical and categorical data, supporting various initialization methods, distance functions, and parallel execution.",
  "sources": "Input data X, optional categorical column indices, random seed, sample weights, configuration parameters such as n_clusters and init method.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; the code primarily performs data processing and clustering calculations without external network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (X) flows into data preprocessing (pandas_to_numpy), encoding (encode_features), and clustering steps, with centroid updates and label assignments. No untrusted data is directed to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; the code is a standard clustering implementation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive implementation of k-prototypes clustering, with functions for initialization, iteration, centroid updates, and parallel execution. It handles numerical and categorical data separately, encodes categorical features, and employs standard distance metrics. No external network operations or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Use of random_state ensures reproducibility, and the logic appears consistent with standard clustering techniques. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or malicious modifications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of the k-prototypes clustering algorithm with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs data clustering tasks securely and transparently, relying solely on standard scientific computing libraries and well-defined methods.",
