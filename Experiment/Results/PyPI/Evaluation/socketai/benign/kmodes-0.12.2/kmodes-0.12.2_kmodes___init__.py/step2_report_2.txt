  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is: `__version__ = '0.12.2'`.\n   - It is a standard version string assignment, common in Python packages.\n   - No external data input/output, no functions, no network calls, no obfuscation.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports agree that this is a benign, straightforward version declaration.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious indicators are present.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation or malware.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n   - The conclusions are appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable, given the code's simplicity.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The reports uniformly assign `securityRisk` and `malware` scores of 0.\n   - Given the code's benign nature, these scores are justified.\n   - No reason to increase the risk or malware scores.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are grounded in the code's straightforward assignment.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores align with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or inconsistencies.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThis code fragment is a standard version string assignment, with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided assessments and the code's simplicity.",
