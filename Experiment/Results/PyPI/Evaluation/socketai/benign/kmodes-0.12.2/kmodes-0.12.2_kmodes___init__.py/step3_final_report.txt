  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable for package versioning.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only assigns a static string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment with no data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no input/output, no external dependencies, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores reflecting no malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The code's simplicity and clarity support a conclusion of no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
