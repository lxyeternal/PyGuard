  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code snippet:\n\nCode snippet:\n```python\n__version__ = '0.12.2'\n```\n\n**Confirmation of issues:**\n- The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n- There are no input/output operations, no external dependencies, no obfuscation, no network activity, and no malicious code.\n- All reports agree that this is a benign, standard practice in Python packages.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as a simple version declaration with no security risks.\n- No report overstates or understates the risk; all assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0.\n\n**Scores and their reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `obfuscated`: 0 (correct, code is clear)\n  - `malware`: 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n  - `securityRisk`: 0 (correct, no security issues)\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- There are no assumptions in these reports that could be challenged; they all correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is a standard version string assignment with no security implications.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis is a trivial, benign code snippet. No further action needed.",
