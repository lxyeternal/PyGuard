  "flows": "No data flows present, as the code only assigns a string to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; the assignment appears standard for version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a version string to the variable __version__, which is common in Python packages for version tracking. There are no functions, no data input, no external dependencies, no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. Given its simplicity, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues.",
