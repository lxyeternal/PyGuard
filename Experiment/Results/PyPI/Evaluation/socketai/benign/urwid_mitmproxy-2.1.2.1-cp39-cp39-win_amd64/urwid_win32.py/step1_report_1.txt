{
  "purpose": "The code provides Python definitions and wrappers for Windows console input/output handling, enabling interaction with the Windows console API for reading input events and manipulating console modes.",
  "sources": "Reads input from console handles via ReadConsoleInputW, gets handle via GetStdHandle, retrieves console info via GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, and sets console modes via SetConsoleMode.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive functions like ReadConsoleInputW and SetConsoleMode that handle console input/output operations. No untrusted data is explicitly written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input data from console handles flows into ReadConsoleInputW; console handle retrieval via GetStdHandle influences input reading; console info retrieval via GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo; console mode settings via SetConsoleMode.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for Windows console interaction; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code, or obfuscated patterns detected. Usage of ctypes for Windows API is common in system utilities.",
  "analysis": "The script defines structures mapping to Windows console data types, such as input events and screen info, using ctypes. It wraps Windows API functions to get and set console modes, handle input events, and retrieve console buffer info. No suspicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, mainly for console manipulation, typical in Windows CLI tools or debugging utilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Windows console API wrapper written in Python for legitimate system interaction. No malicious intent, sabotage, or malware signatures are evident. It appears safe and intended for console input/output handling, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
