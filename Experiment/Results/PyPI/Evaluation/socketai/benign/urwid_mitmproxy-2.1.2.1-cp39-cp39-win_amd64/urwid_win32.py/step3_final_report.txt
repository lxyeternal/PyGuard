{
  "purpose": "Defines Windows console structures, constants, and API function prototypes using ctypes for console interaction.",
  "sources": "Reads input from console via ReadConsoleInputW, accesses console handles with GetStdHandle.",
  "sinks": "Potentially reads untrusted user input through ReadConsoleInputW; no data is transmitted or processed maliciously within this code.",
  "flows": "Input is read from console (source) via ReadConsoleInputW; no downstream processing or transmission shown.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward API bindings.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard Windows console API wrappers, defining structures and functions for console handling. It does not process or transmit data maliciously. The use of ReadConsoleInputW could handle untrusted input, but no malicious behavior or data exfiltration is evident. The code appears to be a utility module for console interaction, with no signs of sabotage or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Windows console API wrapper with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns. It is safe for use and does not pose security risks within its scope.",
