{
  "purpose": "The code provides a collection of terminal UI widgets for rendering text, boxes, bar graphs, progress bars, and ASCII logos using the Urwid library. Its primary function is visual display within terminal applications.",
  "sources": "Input data from constructor parameters, set_* methods, and internal properties used during rendering.",
  "sinks": "Rendering outputs to terminal canvases; no external data transmission, network activity, or file operations are involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and internal state through rendering functions to produce visual output; no external untrusted data or system calls are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic detected. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses standard UI rendering patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of UI widget classes that process input data for visual representation in terminal environments. There are no external data sources, network interactions, or system modifications. The data flows are confined within the widget methods, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The code employs standard practices and external libraries (Urwid) without dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors. The consistent absence of suspicious patterns across multiple reports indicates a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source terminal UI widget library with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe for inclusion in supply chain deployments, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score around 0.0 to 0.1.",
