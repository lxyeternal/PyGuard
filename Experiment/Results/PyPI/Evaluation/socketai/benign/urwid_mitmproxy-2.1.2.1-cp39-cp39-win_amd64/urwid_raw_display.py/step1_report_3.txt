  "purpose": "Implement a terminal screen interface for text-based UIs, handling input/output, screen rendering, and terminal properties.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., 'TERM'), system files, and terminal input streams. Uses socketpair for resize signaling. Accesses subprocess outputs for GPM mouse event handling.",
  "sinks": "Writes escape sequences, terminal control codes, and mouse event data to the output stream. Sends signals to system processes for mouse tracking and terminal resize.",
  "flows": "Input sources (system input, GPM subprocess, environment variables) -> parse_input() processes data -> callback functions handle input actions. Signals and terminal control sequences are sent to output streams during drawing and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains code for GPM mouse event handling via subprocess, which is an uncommon feature. Use of socketpair for signaling resize events is standard but noteworthy. No hardcoded credentials or secrets found. The code has extensive use of system-specific calls, but no malicious logic is evident. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a complex implementation of terminal handling with features for signal handling, mouse tracking, terminal property configuration, and screen rendering. It interacts with system-specific APIs (Windows via win32, POSIX via fcntl, termios) and manages input asynchronously with threads and event loops. The GPM subprocess handling could potentially be used to capture mouse events in Linux but is not malicious in itself. No hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity is present. The code's structure appears consistent with a legitimate terminal UI library. No evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is found. The code does not perform any external network connections outside GPM subprocess, nor does it send system data to external servers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a terminal UI implementation with system-specific input/output handling, screen rendering, and optional mouse tracking via subprocess. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are detected. It appears to be a legitimate library for terminal interface management.",
