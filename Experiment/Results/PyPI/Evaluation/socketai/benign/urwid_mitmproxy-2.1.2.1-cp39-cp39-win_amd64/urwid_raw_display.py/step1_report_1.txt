{
  "purpose": "This module implements a terminal display interface using escape sequences, managing input/output, signals, and window resize handling for a text-based UI in Python.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('TERM'), standard input/output streams, socket pairs for resize signaling, signals for window resize and continue, and GPM mouse event handling via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Writes escape sequences and terminal control codes to output stream, reads input data from stdin or socket, and handles mouse events via subprocess output. Also reads environment variables and signal handlers.",
  "flows": "Input streams (stdin, socket) -> parse_input() -> callback; Environment variables -> terminal property configuration; Signal handlers -> resize handler -> signals -> terminal redraw; GPM subprocess output -> event parsing -> input processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of socketpair for resize signaling is standard; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; GPM mouse event subprocess launched only on Linux with specific checks; no suspicious code for data exfiltration or backdoors; no obfuscation, unnecessary dynamic code, or misleading variable names. The code's overall structure is complex but typical for terminal handling libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code manages terminal display using escape sequences, handles input from multiple sources (stdin, GPM subprocess, socketpair), and processes signals for resize and continuation. It employs subprocesses for GPM mouse tracking on Linux, with environment and signal handling for terminal modes. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication to untrusted domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of socketpair for signaling is typical for cross-platform resize handling. The code reads environment variables and signals but does not appear to leak data or execute code from untrusted sources. The code appears to be a well-structured terminal interface module with no suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a terminal display and input handling module for Python, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It employs standard techniques for terminal control, signal handling, and input processing. No malware or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
