  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured terminal UI library with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The use of external 'mev' for mouse tracking is standard on Linux and does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low risk score (~0.2) due to external dependency considerations."
