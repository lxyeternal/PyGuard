  "purpose": "A terminal UI implementation managing input/output, signals, and rendering, including platform-specific handling and mouse tracking via subprocess.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, stdin, socket pairs, subprocess for mouse events, signal handlers.",
  "sinks": "Escape sequences, terminal control codes, subprocess invocation for 'mev' mouse tracking.",
  "flows": "Input reading from stdin or socketpair → parsing and handling signals → writing escape sequences and control codes → subprocess for mouse events.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess 'mev' for mouse tracking; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; standard techniques employed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive terminal interface library, handling platform-specific terminal modes, signals, and input. It uses subprocess 'mev' for Linux mouse tracking, which is a known, benign tool. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The subprocess dependency is typical for Linux mouse support but could be exploited if the binary is malicious or replaced. No obfuscation or secrets are detected. The code structure and behavior align with legitimate terminal UI libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured terminal UI library with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The use of external 'mev' for mouse tracking is standard on Linux and does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low risk score (~0.2) due to external dependency considerations.",
