  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's functionality, data flows, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a standard UI widget framework for text-based interfaces, reading input from keypresses, mouse events, and class attributes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Rendering functions produce Canvas objects; signals emit data such as \"change\" and \"postchange.\" These are typical for UI event handling and do not inherently leak data or perform malicious actions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. The code adheres to standard patterns, with proper separation of concerns.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior. The security risk is negligible.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0. The overall risk is 0. Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar widget framework, with input via 'size', 'key', 'event', 'markup'. Reads class attributes and external modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Potentially malicious inputs could come from 'key', 'event', or 'markup', but these are standard input parameters for UI widgets.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated parts. Usage of signals and caching is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a typical UI library. No malicious behavior or sabotage signs.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0. Security risk is low (0.2). This seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Widget classes for terminal UI, reading from input parameters and class attributes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Rendering produces Canvas objects; input handling affects internal state. No external data transfer or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies or malicious code. Usage of signals and caching is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard UI code with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0. The risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Base classes and widgets for terminal UI, reading from input parameters and internal attributes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Rendering functions and signal emissions are typical; no external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or obfuscated code. Well-structured, standard design.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0. Risk is zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Widget framework, reading user input, class attributes, and external modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Canvas outputs and signal emissions are standard; no network or file I/O.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Usage of external modules is typical.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0. Security risk is low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code appears to be a standard UI framework without malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All are very low, mostly 0 or 0.2, reflecting standard UI code with no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final estimate:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a legitimate, open-source UI widget library with no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior.\n\n**My own scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Security risk:** 0.0 (no vulnerabilities or malicious activity detected)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe and does not pose a security threat.",
