  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard widget framework for terminal UIs, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The signals, input handling, and rendering are typical and safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible, around 0.1 to 0.2 due to potential input manipulation but no malicious payloads."
