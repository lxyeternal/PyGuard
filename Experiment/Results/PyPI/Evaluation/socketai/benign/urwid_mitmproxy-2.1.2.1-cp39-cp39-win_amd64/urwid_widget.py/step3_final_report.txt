{
  "purpose": "The code implements a comprehensive widget framework for terminal-based user interfaces, providing base classes, rendering, input handling, caching, and layout management for various widget types.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to methods (size, key, event), class attributes (e.g., _selectable, _sizing), imported modules and functions, signals emitted during interactions.",
  "sinks": "Rendering outputs as Canvas objects, signal emissions ('change', 'postchange'), internal state modifications, method calls affecting widget display and behavior.",
  "flows": "User input (keypress, mouse events) flows into widget state changes, which influence rendering; signals propagate data updates; internal attributes determine rendering and interaction logic.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected; code structure is clear and adheres to standard widget framework practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, open-source UI widget library for terminal applications, with proper separation of concerns, caching, signal handling, and input processing. No malicious code, data exfiltration, or sabotage mechanisms are present. The data flows are typical for UI components, and no external network or file I/O is involved. The code relies on standard modules and practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard widget framework for terminal UIs, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The signals, input handling, and rendering are typical and safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible, around 0.1 to 0.2 due to potential input manipulation but no malicious payloads.",
