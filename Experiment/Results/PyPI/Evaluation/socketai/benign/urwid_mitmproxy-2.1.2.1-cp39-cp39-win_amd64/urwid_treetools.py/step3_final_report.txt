  "purpose": "Implementation of a terminal-based tree widget using urwid, providing visual and interactive tree structures with expand/collapse functionality.",
  "sources": "Internal node attributes (get_first_child, get_last_child, get_parent, get_key, get_value), user input events (keypress, mouse_event).",
  "sinks": "UI state updates (expanded/collapsed icons), widget rendering, user input handling.",
  "flows": "User input (keypress/mouse) influences widget expansion/collapse; node attributes determine widget display; virtual functions load nodes and widgets dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Virtual functions (load_parent, load_child_node) are intended for subclassing, not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured urwid UI component for displaying trees in a terminal. It uses virtual functions for extensibility, which could be misused if subclasses are malicious, but the base code itself is safe. No external data leaks, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscation. The virtual functions are typical for abstract base classes, and the overall logic is consistent and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of a terminal tree widget with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The virtual functions provide extension points but do not introduce inherent danger. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
