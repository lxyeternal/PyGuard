  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of a terminal tree widget with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The virtual functions provide extension points but do not introduce inherent danger. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
