  "flows": "Import statements execute during module load; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static __init__.py file that imports modules and handles optional dependencies safely. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present. The code does not process external input, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. The import structure is typical and well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and safe. All signals indicate no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.",
