  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**\n   - All reports indicate that the code is a straightforward import statement, with standard licensing comments.\n   - No executable logic, data handling, or network activity is present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious payloads are identified.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no malware or malicious intent.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no security issues.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 or very close to zero\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The one report with a `securityRisk` of 0.1 appears slightly cautious but still within reason, considering the minimal code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are present, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The minimal import statement, especially with licensing comments, does not pose a security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports agree on malware score 0.\n   - This aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims in the reports are based on unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a simple import.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are suggested.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code snippet and the analysis provided.\n   - The slight variation in `securityRisk` (0.1) in one report is acceptable as a conservative estimate but still indicates low risk.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (or very close to zero, e.g., 0.1, but generally 0 is justified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code snippet is a standard, benign import statement with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current low-risk assessment. No changes needed.",
