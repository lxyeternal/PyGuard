  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Issue presence**: The code is a simple import statement with no executable logic.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None identified; the reasoning is sound.\n   - **Scores**: Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Risk score**: 0, justified given the benign nature.\n   - **Overall**: Correct and reasonable.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same as above; a straightforward import.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: No issues.\n   - **Scores**: Malware and obfuscated scores are 0.\n   - **Risk score**: 0, justified.\n   - **Overall**: Accurate.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Issue presence**: No, just an import.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None.\n   - **Scores**: Malware and obfuscated are 0.\n   - **Risk score**: 0.\n   - **Overall**: Correct.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same as previous; benign import.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None.\n   - **Scores**: Malware and obfuscated are 0.\n   - **Risk score**: 0.\n   - **Overall**: Appropriate.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Still just an import statement.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: No, but the confidence is slightly lower (0.9), possibly due to the license header being more prominent.\n   - **Scores**: Malware and obfuscated are 0.\n   - **Risk score**: 0.1 is assigned, which is minimal and acceptable for such benign code.\n   - **Overall**: Slightly higher security risk score is acceptable but could be lowered to 0.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware score**: All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score**: All are 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward import.\n- **Risk score**: All are 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate, consistent, and reasonable. No adjustments needed. The code snippet is a standard, safe import statement with no security concerns.",
