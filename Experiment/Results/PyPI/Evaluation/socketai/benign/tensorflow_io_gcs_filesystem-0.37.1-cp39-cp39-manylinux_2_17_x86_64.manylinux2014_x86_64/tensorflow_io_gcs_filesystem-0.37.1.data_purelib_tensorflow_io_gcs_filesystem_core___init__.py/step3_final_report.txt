  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters, environment variables, standard libraries, network calls, subprocess executions, potential dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system access, environment variable access, system commands, eval/exec statements.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or untrusted input flow into network functions, subprocess calls, or eval/exec, potentially leading to malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, high obfuscation levels, suspicious variable names, access to environment variables, lack of comments, dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common indicators of malicious intent but are not conclusive alone. No direct payloads or backdoors are detected. The suspicious patterns warrant a moderate malware score (~0.3-0.4), high obfuscation score (~0.7), and moderate security risk (~0.55). The absence of confirmed malicious payloads suggests cautious suspicion rather than definitive malware. The code's structure and patterns justify these scores, aligning with the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows significant obfuscation and signs of dynamic execution, raising suspicion but lacking concrete malicious payloads. The overall security risk is moderate. Slightly increasing malware suspicion scores could be justified if more context confirms malicious patterns, but current evidence supports a cautious stance.",
