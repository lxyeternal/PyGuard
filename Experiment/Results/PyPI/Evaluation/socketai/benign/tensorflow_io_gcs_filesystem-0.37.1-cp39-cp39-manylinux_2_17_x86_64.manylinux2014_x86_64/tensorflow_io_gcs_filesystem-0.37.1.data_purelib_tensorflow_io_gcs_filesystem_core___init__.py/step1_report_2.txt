{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but the exact intent is unclear due to minimal context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules or files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file operations, or data serialization/deserialization points where untrusted data might be processed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through functions and modules that could lead to network sockets, file writes, or other external effects.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual or suspicious elements include the use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated variable names, or hidden imports. No obvious hardcoded secrets or malicious backdoors are immediately apparent, but the code structure warrants caution.",
  "analysis": "The code shows standard import statements and function definitions with no explicit malicious behavior. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, malicious network connections, or data exfiltration. The presence of dynamic execution or obfuscated code was checked but not identified. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate. The code does not perform dangerous operations like unauthorized data access or system modification. The overall structure suggests typical utility code, but some parts could benefit from further context to confirm safety.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current analysis, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The code appears benign, but without additional context or full code, a cautious approach is recommended. The likelihood of malicious intent is low, with a security risk score in the safe range.",
