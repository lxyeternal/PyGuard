  "purpose": "The code reads environment variables, user input, or external data sources to process information, possibly for configuration or data handling purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external data sources, files, network connections.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, system calls, environment variable modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network or file operations, potentially via intermediate processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected; code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks. No indicators of malware such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity were found. The data flow analysis shows typical source-to-sink paths without suspicious manipulation. The absence of obfuscation and malicious patterns, combined with benign data handling, supports a low threat assessment. Confidence is high due to the lack of suspicious features, and the overall security risk is minimal. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.2) are consistent with the findings.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores accurately reflect the low threat level, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
