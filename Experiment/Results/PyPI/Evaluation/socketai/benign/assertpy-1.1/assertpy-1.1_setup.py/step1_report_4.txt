{
  "purpose": "To set up and install the assertpy library for unit testing in Python projects.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'assertpy' imported module to access '__version__' and from the setup parameters for static configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that handle untrusted input or could cause data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The version information from 'assertpy.__version__' is injected into the setup parameters for 'version' and 'download_url'.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of 'assertpy.__version__' assumes the attribute exists and is accessible at runtime; no explicit validation or fallback is present. No malicious or unusual code behaviors are observed beyond standard setup routines.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup process, importing 'assertpy' to access its version. There are no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The 'desc' variable contains documentation string, which is standard. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or potentially malicious logic is present. The use of 'assertpy.__version__' could potentially cause errors if the attribute is missing, but this is not indicative of malicious intent. Overall, this is a typical setup script with safe practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal Python package setup configuration for 'assertpy' with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It relies on the 'assertpy' module's version attribute for package info, which is a common pattern. No security risks or malware indicators are found.",
