{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'assertpy' Python package, including metadata and package details.",
  "sources": "Reading package imports, reading assertpy.__version__, static string literals for description, author, URL, etc.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; setup configuration data does not influence system behavior or data leakage.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; static data remains static.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assertpy.__version__' for versioning could potentially be exploited if the attribute is manipulated, but this is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'assertpy' and 'distutils.core' to define setup parameters. It constructs a description string and uses 'assertpy.__version__' for versioning in URLs and version fields. The setup() call supplies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only defines package metadata and installation details.",
