{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for the 'assertpy' Python package, including metadata and package details.",
  "sources": "Data sources include the imported 'assertpy' module to retrieve its version for the setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of 'assertpy.__version__' in the download_url and version fields, which could be manipulated if 'assertpy' is compromised.",
  "flows": "The version obtained from 'assertpy.__version__' flows into the 'version' and 'download_url' fields in the setup function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code primarily handles package setup; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'assertpy' to access its version attribute, then uses that value in the setup configuration. The rest of the code is standard for Python package setup, including metadata and classifiers. No data is read from untrusted sources or user input; the only dynamic element is the 'assertpy.__version__', which is expected to be a static string defined within the package. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for the 'assertpy' package, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The dynamic version retrieval is safe and typical for package configurations.",
