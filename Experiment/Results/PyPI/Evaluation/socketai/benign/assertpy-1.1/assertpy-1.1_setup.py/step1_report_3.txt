  "purpose": "This script is for setting up the 'assertpy' Python package, including metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package version from assertpy.__version__, static strings for metadata, import of 'assertpy' to access version.",
  "sinks": "Uses string formatting to insert version into download_url, and possibly the import of 'assertpy' which provides the version.",
  "flows": "Import of assertpy -> access to assertpy.__version__ -> inserted into download_url; static metadata fields not influenced by untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Importing 'assertpy' just for retrieving __version__ is somewhat indirect, but not suspicious. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'assertpy' solely to obtain its __version__ attribute for package metadata. The setup() function is used to define package info, including name, description, authorship, URLs, classifiers, and versioning. The use of string formatting with the version is standard practice. No user input or untrusted data sources are involved. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The import of 'assertpy' does not appear to execute any code beyond loading the module and accessing its version attribute. Overall, this is typical setup script code.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a standard setup configuration for the 'assertpy' package. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks are present. It reads package version information in a safe, controlled manner. The overall security risk is minimal.",
