{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the assertpy Python package, including metadata and package information.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'assertpy' module for the version, and reads package metadata like author, email, URL, description, and classifiers. It also includes static strings and imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process user input or external data sources at runtime.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'assertpy' to accessing its '__version__' attribute, then uses static strings and variables to set up package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. All imported modules and data are standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python 'setup.py' file for package distribution. It imports the 'assertpy' library solely to access its version attribute for package metadata. The rest of the code consists of static strings and typical setup parameters. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data processing occurs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. All elements follow conventional package setup patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for the 'assertpy' package, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and configuration.",
