{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the 'assertpy' Python package, importing 'assertpy' solely to retrieve its __version__ attribute for versioning in package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'assertpy.__version__' to obtain the package version; this attribute is accessed during setup to set the 'version' and 'download_url' fields.",
  "sinks": "The version information flows from 'assertpy.__version__' into the setup parameters; no other untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "flows": "The source 'assertpy.__version__' flows directly into the 'version' and 'download_url' fields in the setup function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard practices. Importing 'assertpy' only for its version attribute is common. No suspicious or obfuscated code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration for packaging a Python library. It imports 'assertpy' to access its static '__version__' attribute, which is then used in the package metadata. The code contains no malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation. The dynamic retrieval of version info is a standard, safe practice. The static strings and structure are conventional. Given the benign nature of the code, there are no security risks or malicious behaviors present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup script for the 'assertpy' package. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. The use of 'assertpy.__version__' is a common pattern in Python packaging, and no security concerns are evident. The assigned scores accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.",
