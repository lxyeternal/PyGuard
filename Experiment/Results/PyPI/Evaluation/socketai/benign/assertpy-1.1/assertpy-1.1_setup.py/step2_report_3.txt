  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code imports 'assertpy' to retrieve its version for the setup configuration.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** The version flows into 'version' and 'download_url' fields.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious code detected; the use of 'assertpy.__version__' is standard.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The setup script is typical, with no signs of malicious activity. The dynamic version retrieval is safe.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (low, considering the dynamic version usage).  \n**Verdict:** No issues; scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward package setup.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No risky data flow; static data used.  \n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code; importing 'assertpy' just for version is standard.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard setup, no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—importing 'assertpy' to get version.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Safe data flow; static strings.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; indirect import not suspicious.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical setup script.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.  \n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup, version from 'assertpy'.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No issues.  \n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; reliance on 'assertpy.__version__' is common.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Static data, safe.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate setup script.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.  \n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script for 'assertpy'.  \n- The only dynamic element is the retrieval of the version from 'assertpy.__version__', which is a common and safe practice.  \n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.  \n- The risk scores are appropriately low, given the context.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, standard setup process)\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on this analysis, I would agree with the provided scores, possibly even lowering the risk score to 0, since the process is entirely standard and safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe setup code is benign, standard, and does not pose security risks. The use of 'assertpy.__version__' is a common pattern in Python packaging, and no malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
