  "purpose": "Collection assertions mixin providing methods to verify if a value is iterable, not iterable, a subset of given collections, or sorted.",
  "sources": "self.val property accessed in each assertion method.",
  "sinks": "Error method calls that raise AssertionError; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data (self.val) flows through type checks and comparisons to validation conditions, raising errors if conditions fail.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward collection assertion utility with methods like is_iterable, is_not_iterable, is_subset_of, and is_sorted. It performs internal validation on self.val, raising exceptions on assertion failures. No external data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code uses standard Python constructs and exception handling. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is intended for testing or validation purposes and is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured collection assertion utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with its functionality.",
