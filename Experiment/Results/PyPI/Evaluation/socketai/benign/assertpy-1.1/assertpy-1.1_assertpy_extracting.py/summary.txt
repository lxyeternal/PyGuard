  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The potential security concern with user-defined functions is a known risk but not indicative of malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
