{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package, likely providing assertion utilities and file content reading functions for testing or utility purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.assertpy and .file), which may read or initialize internal data structures; no external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system calls that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily defines imports and package structure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code present. The code is standard import statements and module references.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of import statements with no data processing, external inputs, or output behaviors. It does not include dynamic execution, user input handling, or network activity. The use of relative imports suggests a structured package, but no suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is benign, serving as part of a larger package. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this fragment.",
