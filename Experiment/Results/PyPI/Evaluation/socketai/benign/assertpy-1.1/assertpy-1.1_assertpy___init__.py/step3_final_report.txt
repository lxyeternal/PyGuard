{
  "purpose": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, indicating standard package setup without any data processing or dynamic behavior.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.assertpy' and '.file' modules, which are internal to the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not handle external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code execution, external data handling, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import section typical for a Python package module, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify this as benign, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0 and a very low security risk score (mostly 0, with one at 0.1). The minimal risk score in one report is justified but slightly overstated given the code's simplicity. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation, and the code does not process external data or perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores assigned by all reports are appropriate. No modifications are necessary; the overall security assessment is that this code poses no threat.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
