  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom __future__ import absolute_import\nfrom .assertpy import assert_that, assert_warn, soft_assertions, fail, soft_fail, add_extension, remove_extension, WarningLoggingAdapter, __version__\nfrom .file import contents_of\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code only contains import statements from internal modules.\n- No dynamic code execution, input handling, or network operations.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n- The code appears to be part of a structured package, likely `__init__.py` or similar.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Importing functions/variables from internal modules.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, straightforward imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar import setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent, very low security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, standard package import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, standard practice.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same import pattern, minimal code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No external input, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Critical note:** The securityRisk is set to 0.1, which is very low, and malware=0. The reasoning is consistent with the code snippet. The confidence is slightly less than 1, perhaps due to the minimal nature of the code, but overall, the assessment is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- **Are the scores consistent?** Yes. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware=0 and obfuscated=0.\n- **Is there any hidden malicious behavior?** No. The code is purely import statements.\n- **Are any claims based on assumptions?** No. The reports avoid assumptions; they base conclusions on code content.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. The code is benign.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's nature, a low risk score (0) is appropriate.\n\n### Overall:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code snippet is a standard import pattern with no security concerns.",
