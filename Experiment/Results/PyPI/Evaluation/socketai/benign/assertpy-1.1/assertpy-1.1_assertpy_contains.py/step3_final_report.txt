  "purpose": "Collection of assertion methods for testing properties of collections and strings, used as a utility in testing frameworks.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'self.val' and method parameters ('items'), primarily in assertion checks.",
  "sinks": "Error messages include data values, which could potentially expose sensitive information if logged insecurely.",
  "flows": "Source: 'self.val' and 'items'; Sink: 'self.error()' raising AssertionError with data in message.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious code, no network or file system access. Standard Python features used.",
  "analysis": "The code provides collection assertion methods such as 'contains', 'does_not_contain', 'contains_only', etc. It performs logical checks and raises errors via 'self.error()'. No external system interaction, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. Error messages include data, which could be sensitive, but this is typical in assertion frameworks. The code is straightforward and intended for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard assertion utility class for testing collection and string properties. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The minimal security risk stems from potential data exposure in error messages, which is typical and not malicious.",
