{
  "purpose": "The code defines a mixin class for exception assertion testing, allowing users to specify expected exceptions and test if functions raise them when called with specific arguments.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and collections modules, and accesses sys.version_info for Python version check.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No data is received from external sources, and no data is sent or leaked outside the module.",
  "flows": "No external data flow occurs; the code interacts only with internal variables and functions for exception assertion logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward testing utility class. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and defines a class for exception testing. The class provides methods to set expected exceptions and verify that a callable raises the specified exception when invoked with certain arguments. No external input, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code constructs are present. The code's structure is typical of testing frameworks, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for exception testing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It performs expected exception assertions and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code features.",
