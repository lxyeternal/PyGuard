{
  "purpose": "This code provides a mixin class for asserting that a callable raises an expected exception when invoked with specific arguments, mainly for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the callable object 'self.val', expected exception type 'ex', and arguments 'some_args' and 'some_kwargs' provided by the user.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the invocation of 'self.val' with user-provided arguments, which could be malicious if 'self.val' or the arguments are untrusted, but in a testing context, this is standard.",
  "flows": "Input data (callable, expected exception, arguments) flows from the assertion setup to the 'when_called_with' method, where 'self.val' is invoked with the provided arguments. If an exception occurs, its type and message are captured and returned or used for assertion.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code follows standard testing pattern. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. No obfuscation or suspicious code execution methods are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a testing utility mixin class that facilitates exception assertion for callables. It defines methods 'raises' and 'when_called_with' to set expectations and verify that invoking a function with certain arguments raises the expected exception. The code performs standard type checks and exception handling, with no external data sources or network activity. It relies solely on in-memory callable invocation and exception checking. There are no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward testing utility for exception assertions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation, malware, or dangerous logic. The code appears to be legitimate testing code intended for verifying exception raising behavior in unit tests.",
