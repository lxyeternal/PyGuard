{
  "purpose": "Define a mixin class for asserting that a callable raises expected exceptions when invoked with certain arguments.",
  "sources": "sys module for Python version info, collections module for Iterable, and the class's methods which interact with self.val and self.expected.",
  "targets": "self.val (the callable), self.expected (the exception class), and the error handling methods that output messages.",
  "flows": "self.val is called in when_called_with to execute the target function; exception types are checked against self.expected; errors are raised or messages generated accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; standard exception handling and type checks. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a testing utility class for exception assertions, with methods to set expected exceptions (raises) and to invoke callables with arguments (when_called_with). It performs type checks, exception type verification, and error reporting through self.error. The implementation appears standard, with no signs of malicious behavior. The use of sys and collections modules is benign. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code implements a straightforward exception assertion mixin class for testing purposes. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The code is standard and serves its intended testing utility role effectively.",
