{
  "purpose": "A utility class for exception assertion testing, allowing users to specify expected exceptions and verify that callables raise those exceptions with given arguments.",
  "sources": "The method 'when_called_with' invokes 'self.val' with user-provided args and kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of 'self.val' with untrusted input could be a concern if 'self.val' is malicious, but in a testing context, this is standard and safe.",
  "flows": "Input data (args/kwargs) flow into 'self.val' via 'when_called_with', which may raise exceptions caught and processed for assertion.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors; the code is straightforward and standard for testing utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an 'ExceptionMixin' class with methods to set expected exceptions ('raises') and verify that a callable raises those exceptions when invoked with specific arguments ('when_called_with'). It performs type checks, exception handling, and error reporting. It uses standard modules ('sys', 'collections') for compatibility. No external data sources, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The invocation of 'self.val' with user-provided arguments is typical in testing frameworks. Overall, the code is a benign utility for exception assertions, with no malicious or security-compromising features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard testing utility class for exception assertions. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0, reflecting its benign nature.",
