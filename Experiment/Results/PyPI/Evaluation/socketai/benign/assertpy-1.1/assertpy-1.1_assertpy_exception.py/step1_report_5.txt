{
  "purpose": "The code provides a mixin class for asserting exceptions in unit tests, enabling chained exception testing behaviors.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it operates on functions passed via method calls and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations such as network, file, or environment access.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code merely invokes functions and performs checks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a testing utility class with no suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a mixin class for exception assertions in tests, including methods to specify expected exceptions and verify that functions raise them when called with specific arguments. It employs type checks and exception handling to facilitate chained assertions. There are no external data inputs, no network or system modifications, and no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The code is well-structured, typical for testing utilities, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing utility for exception assertions with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions solely within the scope of testing assertions and does not perform any harmful or suspicious operations.",
