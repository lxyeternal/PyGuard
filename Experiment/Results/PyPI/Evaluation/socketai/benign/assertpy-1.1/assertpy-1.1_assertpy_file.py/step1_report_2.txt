  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and assertions for handling and verifying files and paths.",
  "sources": "Imports 'os' and 'sys' modules; reads file contents via 'contents_of' function.",
  "sinks": "Reads file contents; checks for file existence, type, and path structure.",
  "flows": "File input reads from 'file.read()' or 'open(file)', path checks using 'os.path' functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; standard file handling and path validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical file I/O and path assertions, with no evidence of malicious intent. It uses safe practices for file reading and path validation, with no network communication, obfuscation, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected. The code strictly focuses on file system checks and content reading, which are standard and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for file operations and path assertions with no signs of malicious or maliciously sabotaged behavior.",
