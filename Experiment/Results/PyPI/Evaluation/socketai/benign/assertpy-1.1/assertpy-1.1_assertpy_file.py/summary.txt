  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for filesystem validation and content reading. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is detected. The minimal security risk score (0.1) assigned in one report is justified due to the potential misuse of file reading but does not indicate actual malicious activity."
