{
  "purpose": "This code provides internal helper functions for data validation, formatting, comparison, and type checking, primarily intended for use within a larger Python application or library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from method parameters and some built-in modules (sys, collections, numbers, datetime). It does not read external input or network data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code that process untrusted data or perform actions affecting system security, such as network connections, file writes, or command executions.",
  "flows": "The functions perform internal data validation, formatting, and comparison operations without external data flows or untrusted data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a collection of internal utility functions with no indications of malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or hidden network activity. The presence of detailed exception messages and extensive data validation is typical for utility libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of helper methods for formatting, validating, and comparing data structures and types. It includes compatibility handling for different Python versions. All functions serve standard validation or formatting purposes without executing external commands, writing files, or performing network operations. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation, are present. The code is purely for internal utility purposes, with no external side effects or security-relevant actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of utility functions for internal data validation, formatting, and comparison. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard utility module with no suspicious behavior.",
