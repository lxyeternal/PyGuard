{
  "purpose": "Provide internal helper functions for data formatting, validation, and comparison, likely used within other modules or classes.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; internal methods process parameters passed during function calls.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; no data output, network communication, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; functions operate on passed parameters without external data flow or network interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; code consists of standard utility functions with proper structure. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code includes various helper functions for formatting, validation, and comparison of data structures. It employs standard Python libraries, performs type and range checks, and handles dict-like and iterable objects carefully. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious data handling. The licensing comments are standard boilerplate, and the functions focus solely on internal data processing tasks without external interactions or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions for internal data validation and formatting, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured and adheres to typical coding standards. No security concerns or malware signals are detected.",
