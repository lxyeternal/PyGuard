  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a collection of internal utility functions for data formatting, validation, and comparison.\n- They emphasize that the code does not process external or untrusted data directly, nor does it perform network, file, or system operations.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, and confidence levels are high (mostly 1, with one at 0.9).\n- The security risk scores are also very low or zero, reflecting benign utility code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, the code is straightforward utility functions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws in logic:** No significant flaws are evident. Minor issues like inconsistent exception messages or code style are present but do not impact security.\n- **Scores given:**\n  - Malware: consistently 0 across all reports.\n  - Security risk: mostly 0, with one at 0.1, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:** No, the reports correctly identify the code as internal utility functions without external data handling or malicious intent.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or supply chain attack vectors.\n- The functions are purely for data validation and formatting, with no external data ingestion, network activity, or file operations.\n- The license boilerplate is standard and unrelated to malicious activity.\n- The code does not execute external commands or handle untrusted inputs directly.\n\n### Final Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be **0**. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of external data handling, no vulnerabilities, and benign purpose, a **0** is appropriate. Slightly higher (e.g., 0.1) could be justified if considering potential misuses, but given the evidence, 0 is more accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Expert Estimate:**\n\n| Score Type       | Suggested Value | Justification                                                      |\n|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | **0**           | No malicious activity or payloads present.                          |\n| Obfuscated       | **0**           | Code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.                |\n| Security Risk    | **0**           | No external data handling, network activity, or system operations. |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided code is a benign set of internal utility functions with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe and typical for internal data validation and formatting purposes.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always monitor for future changes or integrations that might introduce external data handling or other risk factors, but based on the current analysis, this code is safe.",
