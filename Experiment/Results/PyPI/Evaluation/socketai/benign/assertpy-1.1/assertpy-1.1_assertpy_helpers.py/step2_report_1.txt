  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as a collection of internal utility functions for data formatting, validation, and comparison.\n- They emphasize that the code does not read external input, perform network or file I/O, or execute external commands.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated patterns are detected.\n- The code appears well-structured, with standard Python practices, and no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and the malware and obfuscated scores are consistently 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Consistency:\n- **Code content:** The code is purely utility functions for data validation, formatting, and comparison.\n- **External interactions:** No external data sources, no network, no file operations.\n- **Malicious indicators:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Behavior:** All functions operate on parameters passed in; no external influence or side effects.\n- **License:** Standard boilerplate license; no malicious intent.\n\n### Error, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The code appears correct and standard for internal utility functions.\n- The only minor note is that the code is extensive, but that doesn't impact security assessment.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. Justified; no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. All reports agree; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very close to it. Given the nature of the code, this is appropriate.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The last report assigns a **securityRisk** of 0.1, which is slightly higher than others. Given the benign nature, this is marginal and acceptable, possibly reflecting a conservative default.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Code safety:** All evidence indicates this is benign utility code.\n- **Malware likelihood:** **0**.\n- **Obfuscation likelihood:** **0**.\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk detected).\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n| Score Type      | Suggested Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | **0**             | No malicious activity or indicators detected.              |\n| Obfuscated      | **0**             | Clear, readable code with no obfuscation patterns.         |\n| Security Risk   | **0**             | No external data handling, no system impact, no vulnerabilities. |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign set of internal helper functions with no security concerns or malware signals. The high confidence and low scores are justified based on the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that the context in which this code is used does not introduce external risks. Based solely on this snippet, it is safe.",
