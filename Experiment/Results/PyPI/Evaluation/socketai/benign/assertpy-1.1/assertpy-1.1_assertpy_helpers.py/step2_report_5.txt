  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual content, the scoring, and potential security implications.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a collection of internal utility functions for data formatting, validation, and comparison.\n- It uses standard Python modules and performs no external data handling, network I/O, or file operations.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The functions operate purely on passed parameters, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1-4:**  \n- All four reports conclude that the code is benign, utility functions with no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no signs of malware or obfuscation.  \n- They assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk close to 0, with high confidence.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Also concludes benign nature, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk score (0.1).  \n- The mention of potential \"security risk\" seems to stem from a cautious approach rather than actual evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n- **Code Content vs. Reports:**  \n  - The code does not process untrusted data sources, does not perform network or file operations, and contains no malicious patterns.  \n  - All reports correctly identify this as utility code, not malicious.\n\n- **Scores for Malware and Obfuscated:**  \n  - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code analysis.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  - The scores are mostly 0, with one report (Report 5) assigning a very low risk (0.1).  \n  - Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Justification for Risk > 0.5:**  \n  - No evidence suggests any component of this code is risky or malicious.  \n  - Therefore, any score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n\n- The code is a standard utility class with no external or untrusted data processing, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns.  \n- The detailed exception messages and validation are typical for internal utility code, not malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, readable code, no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate based on the analysis:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign utility module with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, and the scores should reflect that. No adjustments are necessary.",
