  "purpose": "Internal utility functions for data formatting, validation, and comparison.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed into functions; no external input reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions operate on passed parameters only.",
  "flows": "Data flows within functions through parameter manipulation; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of internal helper methods for data validation, formatting, and comparison. It uses standard Python modules and practices, with no external I/O, network operations, or malicious patterns. The functions are straightforward, operate on passed arguments, and do not introduce security risks. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The code is well-structured and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of internal utility functions with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
