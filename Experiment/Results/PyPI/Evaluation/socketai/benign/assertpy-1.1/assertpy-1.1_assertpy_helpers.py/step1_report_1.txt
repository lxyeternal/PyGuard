{
  "purpose": "This code provides internal helper functions for data formatting, validation, and comparison, likely used as part of a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Reads include importing standard modules such as sys, numbers, datetime, collections, and checking sys.version_info. No external or user inputs are directly read within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present. The code does not perform any network I/O, file I/O, or other potentially malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are evident; functions operate on parameters provided internally or by the caller, with no external data influence shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are detected. The code strictly implements utility functions for validation and formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a HelpersMixin class with multiple methods for formatting items and arguments, validating range and closeness, checking dict-like and iterable objects, and comparing dictionaries with options for ignoring or including specific keys. The methods rely on standard Python modules and do not process external or untrusted data directly. There are no indications of malicious behavior, code injection, or privacy violations. All functions are straightforward and serve as internal utilities. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign collection of utility functions intended for internal use, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, with no external data handling or potentially harmful operations.",
