  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a collection of internal utility functions for data formatting, validation, and comparison.\n   - There are no indications of external data handling, network I/O, file operations, or code that could be malicious.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and benign.\n\n2. **Code Functionality and Logic:**\n   - The functions perform type checks, range validations, and data comparisons.\n   - They include compatibility handling for different Python versions.\n   - The functions are purely internal helpers with no external side effects.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports and the code itself indicate no malicious activity. The malware score should be **0**.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated. The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n   - **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any malicious behavior, external data handling, or security vulnerabilities, the overall security risk is minimal. A score of **0** is appropriate.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations:**\n   - Some reports assign a security risk of 0.1 or similar, likely due to cautious default or generic utility code. However, given the detailed review, even this small value is unwarranted.\n   - The scores should be consistent across reports, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the detailed review, I agree with the overall consensus that the code is safe.\n   - I would assign the following scores:\n     - **Malware:** 0\n     - **Obfuscated:** 0\n     - **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a benign set of internal utility functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n- The current scores in the reports are reasonable but could be refined to zero for malware and obfuscated, and zero for overall security risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
