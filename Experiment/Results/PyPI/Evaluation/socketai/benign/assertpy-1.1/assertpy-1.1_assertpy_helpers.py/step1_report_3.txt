{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper utilities for internal use, including formatting, validation, and comparison functions, mainly for data structures and types.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads untrusted input directly; it primarily defines utility methods and imports modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the functions operate on parameters and internal data, with no network or file operations, nor any execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The functions manipulate data passed as arguments, with no source-to-sink data flow involving untrusted sources or external data streams.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. All functions are utility-based, and there are no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility helper methods for data formatting, validation, and comparison, including range checks, close-to validation, dict-like and iterable checks, and dict comparison. All methods operate on provided data and perform validation or formatting without executing external code, reading from untrusted sources, or sending data elsewhere. The module appears to be a standard internal helper utility, with no network, system, or external side effects. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior in any part of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign collection of utility functions for internal data handling and validation, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be safe and unrelated to supply chain attacks.",
