{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations, custom wrapper classes, and utility functions for enhanced type safety and method wrapping, primarily for internal use in larger codebases.",
  "sources": "Imports from builtins and standard libraries, type checking conditionals, and method definitions including wrap_method.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data flows are limited; the wrap_method calls a passed-in function and wraps its result, which is generally safe.",
  "flows": "The wrap_method function calls the original method and then possibly transforms its result using self._new, but no external input or network operations are involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional import blocks for TYPE_CHECKING to distinguish type hints from runtime classes; no suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily concerned with type safety, custom list/dict/int/float classes for type inference fixes, and method wrapping. It includes conditional imports for type checking, custom class definitions that mimic built-in types, and a wrapper decorator that calls a method and transforms its output. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network operations, or backdoors. The code appears to serve internal utility purposes, with no external communication or risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module aimed at improving type handling and method wrapping. No malicious intent, no suspicious operations detected. It appears safe and standard in nature.",
