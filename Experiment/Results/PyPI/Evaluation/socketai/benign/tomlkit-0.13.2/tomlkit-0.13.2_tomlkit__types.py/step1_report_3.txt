{
  "purpose": "The code defines type aliases and custom wrapper classes for collections, with utility functions for method wrapping, primarily aimed at type safety and extending built-in collection behaviors.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, import statements, and method definitions, particularly the 'wrap_method' function which wraps existing methods.",
  "sinks": "The 'wrap_method' function, which executes the original method and calls '_new' on the result; no external data or untrusted input is directly used or processed.",
  "flows": "The wrapper function calls the original method, receives its output, and passes the result to 'self._new'. There are no indications of external untrusted data flows or data leakage paths.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. The code uses standard Python features and explicit type annotations. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines type aliasing, custom collection subclasses, and a method wrapper for extending method behavior. The use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints and separate runtime class definitions is standard. The 'wrap_method' function wraps methods to post-process their results, calling '_new' on the result, which is a common pattern for method decorators. No external data sources, network calls, or system modifications are present. The code is well-structured, follows Python best practices, and contains no signs of malicious intent or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign utility module designed for enhanced type safety and collection behavior extension. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It is a safe utility code fragment with no security concerns.",
