  "purpose": "Define type aliases, custom mutable list and dict classes, and a method wrapper for type-safe object creation and method call enhancement.",
  "sources": "Type hints, class definitions, function parameters, and return values.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method parameters into wrappers, with potential object creation via _new method.",
  "anomalies": "Use of type checking conditional blocks, custom class definitions that mimic built-in types, and a generic wrapper function; no obvious malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type aliases, custom container classes that extend built-in types for potential special behaviors, and a decorator to wrap methods with additional behavior. There is no code to read user input, network data, or external sources. The custom classes do not perform any actions outside standard extension of built-in types. The wrap_method function is a typical decorator pattern for method wrapping, calling a _new method on results, which appears to be part of a larger class implementation. No suspicious or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is focused on type safety, type hinting, and class extension for standard Python types, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It appears safe and intended for code correctness and extendability.",
