{
  "purpose": "Utility code for type safety, custom collection classes, and method wrapping to enhance type inference and extend built-in types.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, conditional imports, class definitions, and the wrap_method decorator.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks or external data handling points.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with conditional imports for type checking and class extensions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type-safe custom list and dict classes, custom int and float classes, and a method decorator that wraps original methods. It uses conditional imports to separate runtime and type-checking contexts, which is standard practice. No network operations, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. The method wrapper applies a '_new' method to the result, which is benign as long as '_new' is properly implemented elsewhere. Overall, the code is benign, utility-focused, and free of malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for type safety and method decoration, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
