{
  "purpose": "The code defines type aliases, type checking imports, custom mutable collection classes, and a wrapper decorator for methods, primarily for type safety and extension of built-in types.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, conditional imports, class definitions, and the wrap_method function that calls an original method and possibly transforms its result.",
  "sinks": "The wrapper function calls an arbitrary method and returns a transformed result; no direct sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "The wrap_method function takes a method, executes it, and potentially transforms the output via self._new, but there are no external data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code uses standard Python features and appears to be utility/helper code for type-safe custom collection wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type annotations and conditional imports for type checking and runtime. It defines custom list, dict, int, and float classes with added magic methods. The wrap_method decorator wraps methods to call the original, then transform its result using self._new. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, file access, or data leakage mechanisms. The purpose appears to be safe utility code for extending or wrapping built-in types with type safety and additional behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility class and function definitions aimed at extending Python built-in types with additional behaviors and type safety. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The overall security risk is negligible.",
