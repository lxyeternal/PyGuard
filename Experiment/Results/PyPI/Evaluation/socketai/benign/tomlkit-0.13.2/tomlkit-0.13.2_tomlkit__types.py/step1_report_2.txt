{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations, type-specific classes, and a wrapper function for methods, primarily for type checking and extending built-in data types with additional behaviors.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class definitions (_CustomList, _CustomDict, _CustomInt, _CustomFloat), import statements, the wrap_method function, and its inner wrapper function.",
  "sinks": "The wrap_method function's wrapper calls the original method and then possibly invokes self._new on its result.",
  "flows": "The wrapper function captures method calls, executes them, and potentially transforms the output via self._new, which may be user-defined.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or malicious code patterns. The _Custom classes extend built-in types with additional methods, but these are not inherently malicious. The use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints is standard practice. No obfuscated code or suspicious data flows are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines custom classes that extend built-in types with additional methods for in-place operations (__add__, __or__). It uses conditional imports based on TYPE_CHECKING for static type checking, which is common. The wrap_method function creates a decorator that calls the original method and, if the result is not NotImplemented, applies self._new to transform it. This pattern suggests extensibility but does not indicate malicious intent. There are no external data transmissions, dynamic code execution, or suspicious control flows. The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and focused on type extension and method wrapping.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for enhancing data types with additional behaviors and providing a method wrapper. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose appears benign, centered around type safety and method decoration.",
