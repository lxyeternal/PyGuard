{
  "purpose": "This code imports various functions and classes from the 'tomlkit.api' module and defines an __all__ list and version string for module exports.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'tomlkit.api' and module-level variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external communication present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks as the code is purely static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, a version string, and an __all__ list, typical for a package's __init__.py or API exposure module. It does not process data, execute dynamic code, or perform any I/O operations. All signals indicate a benign, static setup for exposing API functions and classes. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard, safe setup for the 'tomlkit' package, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
