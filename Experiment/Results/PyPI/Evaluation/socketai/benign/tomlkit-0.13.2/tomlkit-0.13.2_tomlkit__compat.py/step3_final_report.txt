  "purpose": "A utility function to decode byte strings using multiple fallback encodings, ensuring safe handling of untrusted data.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'string' which may be bytes; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "Decoded string returned; no untrusted data flows into external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "Input 'string' (source) is checked for bytes; if so, attempts decoding with multiple encodings (sink), suppressing errors; fallback to default decoding if needed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward decoding logic, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard decoding operation, checking if input is bytes, then attempting to decode with 'utf-8', 'latin1', and 'ascii' while suppressing Unicode errors. If all attempts fail, it decodes with 'utf-8' with errors ignored. No external network, file I/O, or malicious behavior is present. The use of contextlib.suppress is safe, and the fallback approach is standard. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. The code is simple, clear, and safe, with no obfuscation or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for decoding byte strings with multiple encodings. All evidence indicates no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
