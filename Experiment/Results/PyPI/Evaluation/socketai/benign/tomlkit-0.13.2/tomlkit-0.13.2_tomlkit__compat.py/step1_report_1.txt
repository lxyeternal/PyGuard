  "purpose": "Utility function to decode byte strings into text using a list of encodings.",
  "sources": "Reads input data via the 'string' parameter, which can be bytes or other types.",
  "sinks": "Performs decoding operations that could potentially interpret untrusted data, but no direct leak or malicious effect is evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'string' (source) is checked and possibly decoded using multiple encodings, with a fallback to ignore errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The function accepts a parameter 'string', which is checked for being bytes. If it is not bytes, it returns immediately. If it is bytes, it attempts to decode using a list of encodings: utf-8, latin1, ascii. It suppresses Unicode errors during decoding attempts. The first successful decoding is returned; if none succeed, it decodes with the first encoding, ignoring errors. No external inputs or outputs beyond decoding are involved, and no suspicious or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility for decoding byte strings with multiple fallback encodings. It does not exhibit malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
