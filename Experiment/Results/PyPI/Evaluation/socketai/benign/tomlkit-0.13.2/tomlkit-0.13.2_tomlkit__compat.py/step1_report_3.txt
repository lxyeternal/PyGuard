  "purpose": "Utility function to decode byte strings into text using multiple encodings with fallback options.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'string', which can be of any type but is primarily intended to be bytes.",
  "sinks": "The 'decode' method called on 'string' if it is of type bytes.",
  "flows": "If 'string' is bytes, attempts decoding with multiple encodings until successful; otherwise, returns 'string' as is.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code handles decoding with multiple fallback encodings safely. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'decode' function that first checks if 'string' is of type bytes. If not, it returns 'string' directly, avoiding unnecessary processing. If 'string' is bytes, it iterates over a list of encodings ('utf-8', 'latin1', 'ascii') and attempts to decode the byte string using each encoding within a context suppressing Unicode errors. If decoding succeeds, it returns the decoded string immediately. If all encodings fail, it defaults to decoding with the first encoding ('utf-8') with errors ignored, ensuring the function always returns a string. The code uses standard Python libraries and safe practices without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe utility function for decoding byte strings with multiple fallback encodings. No malicious intent or security risks are detected. The implementation is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
