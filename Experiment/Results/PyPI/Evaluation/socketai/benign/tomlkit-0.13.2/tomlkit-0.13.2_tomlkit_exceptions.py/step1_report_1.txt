{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for a TOML parser, mainly for error handling and reporting during parsing.",
  "sources": "Exception class constructors and property methods that handle error messages and error details.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; primarily, the code constructs error messages.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as this is error class definitions without data flow logic or input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code strictly defines error classes with no executable or network-related code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions used for parsing errors in TOML files. It includes constructors that format error messages with line and column information, but no processing of untrusted data, user input, or network communication. There are no obfuscated constructs, dynamic execution, or suspicious logic. The classes serve solely for error reporting and handling within a parser context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward collection of custom exception classes for parsing errors. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful logic. The code is benign and solely for error handling.",
