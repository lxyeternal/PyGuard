{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes for a TOML parser, used to handle various parsing errors and key issues.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed during exception instantiation such as line, column, character, key, and message.",
  "sinks": "Error messages formatted from input parameters; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into exception message formatting; no data flow beyond error reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward exception class definitions with static or parameter-based messages.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions with constructors formatting error messages based on parameters. There is no executable logic, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The exception messages are static or derived from parameters used only for reporting. The code is standard for error handling in a parser, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely for error reporting, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
