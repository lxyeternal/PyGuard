{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors encountered during parsing and validation of TOML data.",
  "sources": "Exception class constructors and property methods, mostly initializing and referencing internal variables.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__() calls with formatted messages, raising exceptions based on parsing errors or logical validation failures.",
  "flows": "Input data such as line, column, characters, and message strings flow into exception constructors, which then generate error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of exception handling is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code provides various custom exceptions tailored for TOML parsing errors, such as syntax errors, invalid values, and internal parser errors. All exception classes are straightforward, initializing with context-specific data and raising errors with formatted messages. There are no indications of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. No external inputs are processed insecurely. The code does not include any network operations, file I/O, or other potentially dangerous actions. All class methods and properties are used for error reporting and do not perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines exception classes for error handling in a TOML parser. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation is standard and safe for its intended purpose.",
