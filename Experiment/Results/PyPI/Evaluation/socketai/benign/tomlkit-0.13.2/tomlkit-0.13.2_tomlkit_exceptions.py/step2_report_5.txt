  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \n   The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for a TOML parser, including syntax errors, key errors, and other parsing-related issues. These classes are standard Python exception subclasses, with constructors that format error messages incorporating line, column, character, or key information. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n\n2. **Potential Security Concerns**  \n   - The code does not process untrusted data directly; it only formats error messages based on parameters supplied during exception instantiation.\n   - Exception messages are static or based on input parameters but do not involve executing or evaluating untrusted code.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are present.\n   - No external data sources, network interactions, or file I/O are embedded within these exception classes.\n\n3. **Malware & Obfuscation**  \n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - Obfuscation is also 0; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated constructs or code hiding techniques.\n\n4. **Error & Score Assessment**  \n   - The scores assigned to malware (0) and obfuscated (0) are appropriate.\n   - The risk score is 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is solely for error reporting and does not pose security risks.\n\n5. **Any Logical or Reasoning Flaws in Reports?**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They recognize that the code is purely for defining exceptions, with no malicious or risky behavior.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are unjustified; the analysis correctly states the benign nature.\n\n6. **Summary & Final Estimation**  \n   - The code is a collection of safe, standard exception classes.\n   - No evidence suggests any malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured set of exception classes for a TOML parser, with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
