{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling errors during TOML parsing and validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions and exception initializations; no external input or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data processing points where untrusted data is handled or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; exception classes are purely for error signaling within the parser.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of custom exception class definitions used for error handling in a TOML parser context. It includes property definitions, error messages, and class inheritance. There are no external input handling, data transmission, or execution of dynamic code. The use of string formatting and exception chaining is standard. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions intended for error handling in a TOML parsing library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
