  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code solely defines custom exception classes for a TOML parser.\n- All constructors and properties are used to generate descriptive error messages.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or external data handling is present.\n- No signs of code obfuscation, dynamic execution, or malicious constructs.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely for error reporting.\n- They note the absence of external data handling, network operations, or obfuscated code.\n- They recognize that the exception classes are standard and do not introduce security risks.\n\n**No significant flaws are apparent in the reasoning.**\n\n---\n\n**3. Review of the Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0.\n- This is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating certainty in the assessment.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \nThe scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- Since the code contains no executable logic, external data processing, or network activity, there is no basis for a high risk score.\n- The code's sole purpose is to define error classes, which is safe.\n\n**Therefore:**  \nRisk scores should remain at 0, reflecting no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**5. Malware Score Consideration:**\n- No malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or external calls, is present.\n- The code is purely for error reporting.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nMalware score should be 0.\n\n---\n\n**6. Challenging Assumptions About Vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential exploits.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- All reports' scores align with the benign, non-malicious nature of the code.\n- No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Justification:**  \nThe code is a standard, straightforward set of exception class definitions for a TOML parser. It contains no malicious logic, no external data handling, and no obfuscation. The error messages are static and used solely for debugging and user notification. There are no security risks or malware indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malicious or security concerns. The provided scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk categories.",
