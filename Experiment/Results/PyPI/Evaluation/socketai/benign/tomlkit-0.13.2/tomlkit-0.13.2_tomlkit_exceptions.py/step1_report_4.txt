{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes used for error handling during TOML parsing, such as syntax errors, type errors, and key errors.",
  "sources": "No data sources or input reading functions; only exception class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or handle external data inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or external data; purely class definitions for error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation present. The code is straightforward and solely for exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception classes for parsing errors and key management errors in a TOML parser. No data inputs, network operations, or external data handling occurs. All classes are standard and follow conventional exception patterns. There is no code that executes or manages data flows, nor any indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The purpose is clearly to define error types for a TOML parser module, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of exception class definitions intended for a TOML parser. It contains no malicious code, no data handling, and no external interactions. The overall security risk is negligible, and there are no indicators of malware or security threats.",
