{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling errors related to parsing TOML files, including syntax errors, invalid values, and key errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads input mainly through the __init__ methods where error parameters like line, col, message, char, and key are provided during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the exception messages which may incorporate input parameters (e.g., line, col, char, key), but they are only used for error reporting and do not process untrusted data further.",
  "flows": "The flow involves input parameters (like line, col, message, char, key) being passed to exception constructors, which then generate descriptive error messages. These messages are used for debugging or user notification but do not influence program control flow beyond raising exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, suspicious external calls, or malicious code behavior are present. The code solely defines exception classes with no side effects or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines exception classes for TOML parsing errors, key errors, and control character validation. All classes inherit from standard Python exception types and use parameters for detailed error messages. There are no data inputs processed from external sources beyond these parameters, no network operations, and no executable code beyond class definitions. The exception messages are descriptive but static, with no dynamic or malicious content. No obfuscation, suspicious logic, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a structured error handling module for a TOML parser, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data beyond error reporting and contains no harmful or suspicious logic.",
