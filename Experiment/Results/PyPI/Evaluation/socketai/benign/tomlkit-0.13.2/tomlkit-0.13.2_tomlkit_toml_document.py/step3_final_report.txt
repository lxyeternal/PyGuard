{
  "purpose": "Define a subclass 'TOMLDocument' inheriting from 'Container' for handling TOML documents.",
  "sources": "Import from 'tomlkit.container' module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow; class declaration without methods or data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; class is empty with only a docstring",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class and defines an empty subclass with no methods, data, or logic. It does not process input, handle data, or perform any operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code appears to serve as a structural extension for TOML document handling, relying on an external library without executing any dynamic or unsafe behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks or malicious intent. It is a simple class extension with no processing logic, data handling, or external interactions, making it safe for use.",
