  "purpose": "Define a class TOMLDocument that inherits from tomlkit.container.Container to represent a TOML document.",
  "sources": "Import statement from tomlkit.container module",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; code solely defines a class without executing logic or data handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present in this minimal class definition",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external library and defines a subclass with a docstring. There are no methods, data processing, input handling, or other potentially malicious constructs. The code appears to serve as a simple extension or placeholder for TOML document handling, with no evidence of malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward class definition that inherits from a third-party library class without any additional logic or data manipulation. There are no signs of malicious activity, malicious code, or security risks present.",
