  "purpose": "Defines a class TOMLDocument that inherits from tomlkit.container.Container, representing a TOML document.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'Container' class from the 'tomlkit.container' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only contains class definition and import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a well-known library 'tomlkit' and defines a subclass with no additional logic or behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security issues. The class appears to serve as a simple extension or placeholder for TOML document handling.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward class definition with an import statement; no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
