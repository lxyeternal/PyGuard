  "purpose": "Define a subclass 'TOMLDocument' inheriting from 'Container' to represent a TOML document.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'Container' from 'tomlkit.container'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class 'Container' from a library and defines a new class 'TOMLDocument' that inherits from it. The class contains only a docstring and no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears to be a harmless class definition intended for managing TOML documents, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
