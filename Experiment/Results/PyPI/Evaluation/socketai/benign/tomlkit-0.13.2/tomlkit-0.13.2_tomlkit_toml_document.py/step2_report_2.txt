  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code simply imports `Container` from `tomlkit.container` and defines an empty subclass `TOMLDocument` with a docstring.\n   - There are no methods, data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No code obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Concerns**:\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as a placeholder or extension for TOML document handling.\n   - Since it doesn't process untrusted data, perform any I/O, or execute dynamic code, it doesn't introduce security risks.\n   - The reliance on an external library (`tomlkit`) is standard for handling TOML data and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Reports**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is minimal, benign, and contains no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n   - The scores assigned (`malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`) are consistent with the code content.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent; no logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly identifies the code as harmless.\n\n5. **Scores Justification**:\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious behavior is detected.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is clear and unobfuscated.\n   - The security risk score of 0 is justified; the code does not pose any security threat.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion**:\n   - The code is a simple class extension with no security issues.\n   - The reports are accurate and consistent with the code content.\n   - No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code snippet appears entirely benign and does not introduce any security concerns.",
