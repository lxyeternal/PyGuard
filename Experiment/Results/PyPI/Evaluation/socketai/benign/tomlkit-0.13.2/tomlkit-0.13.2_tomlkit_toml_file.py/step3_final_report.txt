  "purpose": "Manage reading and writing of TOML files with line ending normalization.",
  "sources": "File open/read operations, content reading, line ending detection.",
  "sinks": "File write operations, content writing to disk.",
  "flows": "Read file content -> detect line endings -> parse with 'loads' -> modify content -> write back to file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file I/O for TOML files, detects line ending styles, and normalizes them during write. It uses well-known libraries ('os', 're', 'tomlkit') with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident. The logic is clear, and the handling of line endings is correct. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for managing TOML files. It poses minimal security risk, with no malware or obfuscation detected. The low risk score (0.1) is appropriate, mainly due to standard file overwrite behavior, which is typical for configuration management. All reports are consistent and accurate.",
