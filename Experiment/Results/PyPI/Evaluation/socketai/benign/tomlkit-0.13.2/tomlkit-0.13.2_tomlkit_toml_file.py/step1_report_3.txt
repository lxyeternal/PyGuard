  "purpose": "This code provides a class for reading and writing TOML configuration files, with attention to line ending consistency.",
  "sources": "The code reads file content via open(self._path, encoding='utf-8', newline='') and loads content using loads(content).",
  "sinks": "The code writes to the file via open(self._path, 'w', encoding='utf-8', newline='') and f.write(content).",
  "flows": "Input source: reading file content -> processing content (detecting line endings) -> parsing with loads -> writing back processed content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution is present. The use of re.sub for line ending normalization is standard. No external inputs besides file reading are involved.",
  "analysis": "The code reads and writes files containing TOML data, handling line endings carefully to preserve consistency. It uses standard libraries and a well-known third-party library (tomlkit). There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The code performs safe file I/O and text processing. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe and intended for legitimate configuration file handling without malicious intent or security risks.",
