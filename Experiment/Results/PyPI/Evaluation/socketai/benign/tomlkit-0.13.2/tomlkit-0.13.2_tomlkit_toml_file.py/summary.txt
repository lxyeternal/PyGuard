  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for managing TOML files. It poses minimal security risk, with no malware or obfuscation detected. The low risk score (0.1) is appropriate, mainly due to standard file overwrite behavior, which is typical for configuration management. All reports are consistent and accurate."
