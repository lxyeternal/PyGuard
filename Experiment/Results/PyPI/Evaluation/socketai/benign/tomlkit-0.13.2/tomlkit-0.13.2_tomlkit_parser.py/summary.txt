  "conclusion": "The parser is legitimate, transparent, and free of malicious code or obfuscation. The only potential security concern is resource exhaustion through crafted input, which is a known parser vulnerability but not malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for supply chain use with minimal risk."
