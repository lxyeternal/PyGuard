{
  "purpose": "A comprehensive TOML parser converting input strings or bytes into structured data objects, handling various data types and syntax validation.",
  "sources": "Input data read from the 'string' parameter via the Source class, primarily through methods like extract(), inc(), and consume().",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures such as Container, Table, Array, and Item objects; no external data transmission or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Input flows from the Source object into parsing functions, which process tokens and build nested data structures; no external sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Unicode parsing and escape sequences are standard utility functions. Exception handling is typical for parsers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard TOML parser with extensive validation, error handling, and Unicode support. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The resource consumption is typical for parsers and could be exploited via crafted input, but this is a common and acknowledged risk in parsing untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The parser is legitimate, transparent, and free of malicious code or obfuscation. The only potential security concern is resource exhaustion through crafted input, which is a known parser vulnerability but not malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for supply chain use with minimal risk.",
