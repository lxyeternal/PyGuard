  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements a parser for TOML data with classes managing parser state (`_State`, `_StateHandler`) and input source (`Source`).\n- Uses context managers to save/restore parser state.\n- Reads input incrementally, manages positions, and raises detailed parse errors.\n- No network, file I/O, or external data handling.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### 1. **Code presence and correctness**\n- The code is fully present.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The logic appears standard for a parser: state management, input iteration, error handling.\n\n#### 2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes**\n- No obvious bugs or security flaws.\n- State management via copying and restoring seems correct.\n- Error handling via `parse_error` is standard.\n- No signs of data leaks or unsafe data handling.\n\n#### 3. **Scores given in reports**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0 or very close to 0.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or around 0.1–0.2).\n- These seem reasonable given the code's nature as a parser utility.\n\n#### 4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5**\n- None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are below 0.3.\n- The code is a standard parser component, with no malicious features.\n- The only potential concern could be error handling raising exceptions, but that’s typical and not malicious.\n\n#### 5. **Malware score assessment**\n- All reports agree on malware score 0 or very close.\n- No malicious behavior, code injection, or external activity is present.\n- The code's purpose is solely parsing, with no hidden payloads.\n\n#### 6. **Claims based on assumptions**\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities.\n- All are consistent with the code's functionality.\n\n#### 7. **Consistency of scores with the report**\n- Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable ratings.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \nAll reports agree on 0.0, which is appropriate. No malicious code detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \nAll are 0, matching the code's clarity.\n\n**Risk score:**  \nGiven the code's benign nature, a risk score around 0.1–0.2 is justified, which aligns with reports.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal risk, primarily related to error handling, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a standard, well-structured parser utility for TOML data. It manages parser state effectively, handles errors properly, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo security concern or malware risk. The code can be considered safe for supply chain inclusion.",
