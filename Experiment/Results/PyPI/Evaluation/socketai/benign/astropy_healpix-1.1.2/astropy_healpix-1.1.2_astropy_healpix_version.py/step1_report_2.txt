{
  "purpose": "Determine the package version using setuptools_scm, with a fallback to a hard-coded version if the import or version retrieval fails.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'setuptools_scm' and the 'get_version' function, as well as the 'try' block executing 'get_version'.",
  "sinks": "The fallback assigns a hard-coded version string; no external data or untrusted input is used or processed.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import and call 'get_version'; if it fails, assign '1.1.2' as version.",
  "anomalies": "The broad exception handling captures all exceptions, which is standard in fallback scenarios but could mask issues unrelated to 'setuptools_scm'. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to dynamically determine the package version using 'setuptools_scm'. If 'setuptools_scm' is unavailable or raises any exception, it defaults to a hard-coded version '1.1.2'. This pattern ensures robustness but does not involve any malicious behavior or security risks. The exception handling is broad but appropriate for a fallback scenario, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version retrieval pattern with fallback and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The broad exception handling is acceptable in this context. No anomalies or malware indications are present.",
