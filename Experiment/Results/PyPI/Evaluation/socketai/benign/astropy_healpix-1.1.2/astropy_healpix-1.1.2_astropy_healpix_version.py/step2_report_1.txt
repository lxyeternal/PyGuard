  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same core code: attempting to import `setuptools_scm` and calling `get_version`, with a fallback to a hardcoded version `'1.1.2'` upon exception.\n- The exception handling is broad (`except Exception`), which is common in fallback patterns but can mask underlying issues.\n- No report indicates any suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- The code does not process external untrusted input, nor does it contain hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.\n- The fallback mechanism ensures robustness but does not introduce security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code snippets in the reports match the original code structure. The logic of import, `get_version` call, and fallback is consistent.\n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports or the code snippets suggest malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No evidence of vulnerabilities such as code injection, data leakage, or external communications.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The use of a broad `except Exception` could mask issues unrelated to the import or version retrieval, such as syntax errors or other runtime errors. While this is a common pattern for fallback, it could hide bugs.\n- No indication of obfuscation or malicious obfuscation techniques.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign `0`, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** The reports assign low scores (mostly 0.1 or 0). Given the code's straightforward nature, this seems reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The low security risk scores are justified; the code is a simple fallback mechanism with no malicious intent.\n- The broad exception handling, while not ideal, does not constitute a security risk in this context.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores across reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The reasoning aligns with the absence of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** (due to broad exception handling, but overall minimal risk)\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- If I were to assign scores independently, I would concur with the current scores.\n- The fallback pattern is standard and does not pose security concerns.\n- No signs of malicious intent or malicious code are present.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward, standard implementation for version detection with a fallback. The reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low scores are justified and consistent.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at **0**.  \n- Maintain a low security risk score (~0.1) due to broad exception handling but recognize it is not malicious.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.**",
