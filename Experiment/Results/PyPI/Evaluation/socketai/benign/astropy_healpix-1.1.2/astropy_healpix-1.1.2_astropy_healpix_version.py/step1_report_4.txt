  "purpose": "Retrieve package version using setuptools_scm, with a fallback to a hardcoded version if import or version detection fails.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'setuptools_scm' and the call to 'get_version' function.",
  "sinks": "Potential fallback assignment to 'version', which is a string variable. No other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import 'setuptools_scm' and execute 'get_version'; on exception, assign hardcoded version.",
  "anomalies": "Catch-all exception handling; fallback to hardcoded version may mask underlying issues but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to dynamically determine the package version using 'setuptools_scm'. If this fails due to import error or other exceptions, it defaults to a hardcoded version string. The broad exception handling could hide issues but does not introduce malicious behavior. There is no evidence of data leakage, external network activity, or malicious code. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version retrieval with fallback logic, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
