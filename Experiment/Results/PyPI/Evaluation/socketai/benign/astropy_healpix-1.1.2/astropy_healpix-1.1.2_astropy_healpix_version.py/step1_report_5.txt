  "purpose": "Determine the package version using setuptools_scm, with a fallback to a hardcoded version.",
  "sources": "Importing get_version from setuptools_scm; calling get_version with specific parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flow leading to untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import get_version and call it; fallback assigns a static version string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling could hide underlying issues but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to dynamically obtain the package version via setuptools_scm. If this fails for any reason, it defaults to a static version string '1.1.2'. The broad exception handling covers all errors, which is not best practice but not inherently malicious. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. There are no obfuscation techniques or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for version retrieval with a fallback. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are present. The fallback ensures robustness but does not pose a security risk.",
