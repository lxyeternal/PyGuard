{
  "purpose": "Determine the package version, falling back to a hard-coded value if setuptools_scm cannot be imported or fails to determine the version.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'setuptools_scm', invocation of 'get_version' function.",
  "sinks": "The version variable assignment, which could be used elsewhere in the package or exposed externally.",
  "flows": "Import 'setuptools_scm' -> call 'get_version' -> assign to 'version' -> fallback to '1.1.2' on exception.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a broad 'except Exception' block may obscure underlying issues; fallback to a static version is a known pattern but could hide import or logic failures.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to dynamically retrieve the version using 'setuptools_scm'. If this import fails or 'get_version' cannot determine the version, it defaults to '1.1.2'. The broad exception handling may mask errors unrelated to missing 'setuptools_scm'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network access, data exfiltration, or code injection. The fallback mechanism is standard practice for package versioning. Overall, this code is straightforward and lacks suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code aims to set the package version dynamically, with a fallback to a static version. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The broad exception handling might hide underlying issues but is not inherently malicious.",
