  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a try-except block attempting to import and call `get_version` from `setuptools_scm`, with a fallback to `'1.1.2'`.\n- The code pattern is a common practice for version detection with fallback.\n- No report indicates any malicious behavior, external network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- The broad exception handling is noted as a potential issue, but it's a standard pattern for fallback and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- The code as provided matches the description in all reports.\n- No anomalies or malicious behavior are present.\n- The fallback to a hardcoded version is a common practice, especially when `setuptools_scm` might not be available or fails.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:\n\n- The reports correctly identify the broad exception handling as a potential masking issue but do not overstate its impact.\n- The reasoning that no malicious activity is present is consistent with the code.\n\n### Score review:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly `0.1` or `0`. Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity, these are reasonable. The slight `0.1` reflects the broad exception handling potentially hiding issues, but it's minor.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1, which is appropriate.\n- The fallback pattern is standard, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is indicated.\n\n### Potential inconsistencies:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minor concern over broad exception handling, but not significant.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious intent or behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward and readable.\n\n**Risk:** 0.1 — broad exception handling could mask underlying issues, but this is common in fallback code and does not pose a significant security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe pattern for version detection with a fallback. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
