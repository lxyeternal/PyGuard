  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency, correctness, and to identify any overlooked risks.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: attempting to import `setuptools_scm` and call `get_version`, with a fallback to `'1.1.2'` on any exception.\n- The logic is straightforward and common in package versioning, with broad exception handling for robustness.\n- No external data inputs, network activity, or suspicious code is involved.\n- The fallback to a hardcoded version is standard practice and does not inherently introduce security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues are present in the code. The fallback mechanism is standard, and the code does not contain malicious elements.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk:** The assigned scores are very low (0.1 or 0), which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Critical evaluation of the reports:\n- **Use of broad exception handling:** While generally discouraged, in this context, it is acceptable because the fallback is a safe default. The reports correctly identify this pattern as not malicious but note it could mask underlying issues.\n- **Potential hidden issues:** The fallback could hide problems like missing `setuptools_scm` or other import errors, but this is a known pattern and not a security concern.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection, is present or implied.\n\n### Score suggestions:\n- The **malware scores** are appropriately set at 0.\n- The **security risk scores** are low (0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal concern.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code does not exhibit any malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- The fallback pattern, while broad in exception handling, is a common and acceptable practice in this context.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard fallback pattern)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code snippet is a standard, safe fallback mechanism for version detection. The reports correctly identify the pattern, acknowledge the broad exception handling, and assign appropriate scores. There is no evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior, and the security risk is minimal.",
