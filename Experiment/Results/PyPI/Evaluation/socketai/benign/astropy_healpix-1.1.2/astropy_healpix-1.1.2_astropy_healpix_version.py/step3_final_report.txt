  "purpose": "Attempt to retrieve package version using setuptools_scm, with a fallback to a hardcoded version if retrieval fails.",
  "sources": "Import statement for setuptools_scm and the get_version function call",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process untrusted data or perform external communications",
  "flows": "Import and call get_version; fallback to hardcoded version upon exception",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad 'except Exception' which can mask unrelated errors; no malicious or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import get_version from setuptools_scm and assign its output to 'version'. If any exception occurs during import or function call, it defaults to '1.1.2'. The broad exception handling is a common fallback pattern but can hide underlying issues. No suspicious behaviors, network activity, or malicious code are present. The fallback mechanism is standard and does not introduce security risks. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign fallback for version detection with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The broad exception handling, while not ideal, does not pose a security risk in this context. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
