  "purpose": "Attempt to determine package version using setuptools_scm, falling back to a hard-coded version if import or version retrieval fails.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'setuptools_scm' and the 'get_version' function call.",
  "sinks": "The variable 'version' being set, which could influence package behavior or installation process.",
  "flows": "Import 'setuptools_scm' -> call 'get_version' -> assign to 'version' -> fallback to hard-coded string if exceptions occur.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a broad exception catch ('except Exception'), which can mask other errors; fallback to a hard-coded version may mask issues with version detection.",
  "analysis": "The code's intent is to dynamically fetch the version using 'setuptools_scm'. If an error occurs during import or version retrieval, it defaults to a fixed version string. No external data input is processed, nor is there any suspicious or malicious code such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The broad exception handling could hide underlying problems, but it is a common pattern for fallback purposes. Overall, the code is straightforward and does not exhibit malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard fallback mechanism for version detection, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply attempts to set a version dynamically and defaults to a fixed string if that fails.",
