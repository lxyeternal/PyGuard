{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for HEALPix pixel calculations, conversions, and interpolations used in astrophysical data analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads include np.asarray, np.log2, np.sqrt, and data inputs such as healpix indices, nside, lon/lat coordinates, and uniq identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include pixel indices, lon/lat coordinates, Cartesian coordinates, and interpolated values. No direct data leaks or system effects observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (indices, coordinates) through validation, conversion functions, and core C-implemented functions to produce outputs such as lon/lat, xyz, pixel indices, or neighbor lists.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. Usage of version-dependent np.copy_if_needed flag and reliance on external _core module are typical. No obfuscation, misleading variables, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard HEALPix-related computations with input validation, conversions between nested and ring orderings, and coordinate transformations. Core computational routines are delegated to a presumably external '_core' C extension, which is typical for performance-critical astrophysical libraries. No malicious activities such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification are present. The code appears well-structured, with proper input validation and safe mathematical operations. The only external dependency, '_core', is not detailed but appears to be a standard extension module. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements legitimate HEALPix data processing functions with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It serves typical astrophysical data analysis purposes securely and transparently.",
