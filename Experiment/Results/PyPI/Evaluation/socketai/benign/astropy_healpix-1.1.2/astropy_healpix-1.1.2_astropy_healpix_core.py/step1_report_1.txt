{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for HEALPix pixel manipulation, coordinate transformations, and interpolation, used in astrophysics for sky mapping.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as pixel indices, coordinates (lon/lat), Cartesian coordinates, and configuration options like 'order' and 'radius'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include coordinate conversions, pixel indices, neighbors, cone search results, and pixel edge coordinates. No data is written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input data (indices, coordinates, parameters) flows through validation functions and into core transformation functions (_core.*). Outputs are derived from these core functions without apparent external communication or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. Usage of _core module functions suggests reliance on external, presumably safe, compiled libraries. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are evident. All data handling appears standard and consistent with typical astro-pixel processing routines.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs coordinate transformations, pixel indexing conversions, and spatial queries related to HEALPix maps. Validation functions ensure input parameters are within expected ranges, such as power-of-two checks and index bounds. Conversion functions (e.g., healpix_to_lonlat, lonlat_to_healpix) utilize underlying core implementations, likely in C or Cython, for performance-critical computations. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or execution of arbitrary code, are present. The code structure follows conventional patterns for scientific libraries, with appropriate validation and modular design. The reliance on an external '_core' module is standard for optimized numerical routines, not suspicious in itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured astrophysics utility library for HEALPix sky mapping and coordinate conversions. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware indicators are present. All functions serve legitimate scientific purposes, and no suspicious data handling or external communications are detected.",
