{
  "purpose": "Provides HEALPix-based functions for pixel calculations, coordinate transformations, neighbor searches, and spatial queries in astrophysical sky mapping.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as nside, level, healpix indices, longitude/latitude, Cartesian coordinates, and offsets; validation functions validate these inputs.",
  "sinks": "External '_core' module functions (likely compiled C extensions) perform core calculations; no data exfiltration or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, then passed to '_core' functions which perform computations; results are converted into astropy coordinate objects or arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is well-structured, with standard validation and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard HEALPix operations with proper input validation. It relies on an external '_core' module for performance-critical routines, which is typical in scientific libraries. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The reliance on external compiled code introduces a trust dependency, but this is common in high-performance scientific software. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. Scores are consistent: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low security risk (~0.1-0.2) due to external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is legitimate, transparent, and free of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of the external '_core' module, which is standard in such libraries. Overall, the code is safe for use in scientific applications with minimal security concerns.",
