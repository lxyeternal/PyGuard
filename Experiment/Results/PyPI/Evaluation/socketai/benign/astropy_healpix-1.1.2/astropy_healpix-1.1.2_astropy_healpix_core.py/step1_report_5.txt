{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for HEALPix pixel calculations, conversions between coordinate systems, and related spatial analyses, primarily used in astrophysics or geographic data processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, including HEALPix indices, longitude and latitude values, Cartesian coordinates, and resolution parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the functions calling core routines that could transmit or process data externally, but no explicit network or file operations are present. The code processes data internally for spatial calculations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs (coordinates, indices, parameters) into conversion and validation functions, then into core routines that perform spatial transformations, and results are returned as processed coordinate or index arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. All functions perform standard spatial calculations with input validation. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution is present. Use of _core functions suggests reliance on external C extensions, which are typical in high-performance spatial libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code rigorously validates inputs (levels, nside, offsets, order), converts between HEALPix index formats, computes pixel areas and resolutions, and performs coordinate transformations. All functions appear to be standard implementations aligned with common HEALPix and spherical coordinate operations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden network calls, or unauthorized system access are observed. External dependencies are limited to core routines and well-known libraries (numpy, astropy). There are no indications of sabotage or malicious modifications. The structure is clean, and the purpose is consistent with geospatial and astrophysical computations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate spatial analysis library for HEALPix data, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs standard, validated transformations and calculations for HEALPix pixels and coordinates. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious signals are detected.",
