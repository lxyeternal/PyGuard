  "purpose": "Build configuration script for a Python extension module involving C source files related to healpix and astrometry.",
  "sources": "Filesystem paths for C source files, constructed using os.path.join and relative paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data processing; static build setup with no data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script that defines C extension sources and build parameters. It imports standard modules, constructs file paths, and returns an Extension object. No dynamic execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. All indicators point to a benign build configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
