{
  "purpose": "The code appears to parse and handle HEALPIX data, coordinate systems, and FITS file data for astronomical analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data can originate from FITS files (via filename string), HDU objects, or tuples containing numpy arrays and coordinate system identifiers.",
  "sinks": "The code processes input data but does not directly write to external systems, network, or files beyond opening FITS files. No data is transmitted externally or stored suspiciously.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (strings, HDU objects, tuples) through parsing functions, converting coordinate system identifiers, and extracting arrays, with no external transmission or manipulation outside normal data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code relies on standard astrophysical data processing libraries. No unusual code patterns or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing astrophysical and numerical libraries, then defines a mapping of coordinate frames. The parse_coord_system function resolves coordinate system identifiers to frame objects, including string-based lookup. The parse_input_healpix_data function handles various input formats: HDU objects, filenames, and tuples, converting them into numpy arrays and coordinate frames. It raises appropriate errors for unsupported types or unknown frames. There is no evidence of malicious data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is standard for scientific data parsing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical data parsing module for astrophysical datasets, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard operations to load and interpret HEALPIX and FITS data, with no external communication or security vulnerabilities detected.",
