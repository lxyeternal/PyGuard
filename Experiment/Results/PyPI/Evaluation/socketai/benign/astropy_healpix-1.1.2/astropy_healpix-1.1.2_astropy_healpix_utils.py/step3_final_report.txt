  "purpose": "Parse input HEALPIX data from FITS files, HDU objects, or tuples, and resolve coordinate system identifiers to astropy frame objects.",
  "sources": "Header 'COORDSYS' field, input data (HDU data, filename, tuple), and frame name lookup via frame_transform_graph.lookup_name.",
  "sinks": "Data array extraction, coordinate frame resolution, and potential exception handling for unsupported frames.",
  "flows": "Header 'COORDSYS' -> parse_coord_system -> frame_transform_graph.lookup_name; input data -> parse_input_healpix_data -> data array and coordinate system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of frame_transform_graph.lookup_name is standard; exception for 'E' frame indicates unimplemented support but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard astrophysical data parsing with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. It uses well-known libraries and functions, with appropriate error handling. No network activity, code injection, or hardcoded secrets are present. The dynamic frame lookup is a common pattern in astropy and does not introduce security risks. The code's logic is straightforward and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard data parser for astrophysical datasets with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current security scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
