{
  "purpose": "The code appears to handle astrophysical coordinate system parsing and HEALPIX data processing, likely for astronomical data analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data from HDU objects in fits files, input strings (file paths), and tuples containing numpy arrays and coordinate system descriptions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external sources or executes untrusted commands. It processes data internally and returns arrays and coordinate frames.",
  "flows": "Input data (HDU or file path or tuple) → parse_coord_system (may call frame_transform_graph.lookup_name) → data extraction and processing → return array and coordinate frame",
  "anomalies": "Use of frame_transform_graph.lookup_name to dynamically resolve coordinate frames; no apparent use of untrusted input in dangerous ways. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated code. No unsafe code injection or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of astrophysical coordinate frames and a function to parse coordinate system inputs, handling strings and coordinate frame objects. It then provides a function to parse HEALPIX data from various input formats, including HDU objects, file paths, and tuples, extracting data arrays and coordinate frames accordingly. The frame lookup uses astropy's frame_transform_graph.lookup_name, which is a standard approach for resolving coordinate frame names. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The only potentially suspicious aspect is the dynamic lookup of coordinate frames, but this is part of standard astropy usage, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard astrophysical data parsing utility with no malicious behavior detected. It safely processes input data and coordinate system information, relying on established astropy functions. There is no evidence of malware, malicious data leaks, or security risks in this code.",
