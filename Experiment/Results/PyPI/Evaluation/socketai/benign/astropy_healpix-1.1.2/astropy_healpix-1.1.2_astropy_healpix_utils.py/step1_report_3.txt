{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for parsing and handling HEALPIX data and coordinate systems, primarily for astronomical data processing.",
  "sources": "Reading data from FITS HDU objects, reading header fields, reading input strings (file paths), and input tuples containing arrays and coordinate frame identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks found; potential usage of data could involve further processing, but no direct data leaks or malicious outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (from HDU, filename, or tuple) -> parse_coord_system or data extraction -> output array and coordinate system object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual code patterns. The only exception is the explicit exception raised for unsupported 'Ecliptic' frame, which is just a supported-not-yet-implemented message.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard astronomy libraries (astropy) and numpy. It defines a dictionary of known coordinate frames and a function to parse coordinate system identifiers, supporting string names and objects. The parse_input_healpix_data function handles different input types (HDU objects, filenames, or tuples) to extract data arrays and coordinate frames. It raises exceptions for unsupported coordinate frames and invalid input types. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The code appears to be straightforward data handling for astronomical datasets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent implementation for parsing HEALPIX data and coordinate frames, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It simply processes input data in expected ways without any indicators of malware or security risks.",
