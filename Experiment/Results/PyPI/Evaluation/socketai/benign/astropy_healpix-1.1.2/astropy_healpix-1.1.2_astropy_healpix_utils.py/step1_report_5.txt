{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process HEALPIX data, parse coordinate systems, and handle FITS files for astronomical data analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads FITS files (via fits.open), extracts data from HDU objects, and processes input tuples containing numpy arrays and coordinate frames.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed internally; no explicit data sinks like network transmissions, file writes, or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input data from FITS files or tuples flows into data extraction and coordinate parsing functions; no data is sent elsewhere or modified maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. The code primarily uses standard library calls and well-documented procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations: it imports common astronomy libraries, processes FITS HDU objects or tuples with numpy arrays, and resolves coordinate frames. parse_coord_system function safely maps strings to known frames or looks up names without executing arbitrary code. parse_input_healpix_data handles different input types, with no unsafe dynamic execution or suspicious behavior. No suspicious network activity, file tampering, or obfuscation is present. Overall, the code appears to be a typical, legitimate astronomical data processing script with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for reading and parsing HEALPIX and FITS data, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. It operates solely on well-understood data structures and libraries, with no suspicious activities detected.",
