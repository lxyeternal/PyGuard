{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse and process HEALPIX data, potentially from FITS files, and convert coordinate systems using astropy for astronomical data analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data from FITS HDU objects or file paths, accesses FITS header fields, and reads numpy arrays from tuples or HDUs.",
  "sinks": "Returns processed numpy arrays and coordinate frame objects; no direct data sinks that could leak data or cause harm are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (FITS HDU or filename) flows through parsing functions, which extract arrays and coordinate systems, returning these in a controlled manner.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. No unusual code constructs or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads external data via astropy's FITS interface and numpy, parses coordinate system strings, and converts them to frame objects. It handles different input types robustly, including file paths, HDU objects, and tuples. No suspicious network activity, file system modifications, or malicious logic are detected. The parsing functions perform standard astronomical data processing, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility for astronomical data processing, with no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or sabotage. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use.",
