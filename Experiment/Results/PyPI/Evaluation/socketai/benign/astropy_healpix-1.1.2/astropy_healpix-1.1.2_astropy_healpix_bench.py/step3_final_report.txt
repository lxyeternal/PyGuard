{
  "purpose": "Benchmarking HEALPix functions for performance measurement, comparing 'astropy_healpix' and 'healpy' packages using randomly generated input data.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from numpy.random (e.g., random angles, pixel indices).",
  "sinks": "Results are stored internally and printed; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Random data flows into benchmarking functions, which execute and record timing results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard performance benchmarking of HEALPix functions with random inputs, conditional imports, and timing measurement. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or external communications are present. The code structure is clear, and the logic is typical for benchmarking scripts. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard benchmarking utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The code's behavior is consistent with performance measurement, and no suspicious patterns are evident.",
