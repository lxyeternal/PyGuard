{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface compatible with healpy for HEALPix operations, including coordinate transformations, pixel indexing, and interpolation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters such as lon, lat, theta, phi, vectors, and pixel indices; also reads from imported modules and functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs data such as pixel indices, coordinates, and interpolation weights; no direct data leaks or harmful outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Transforms coordinate inputs through helper functions, converting between systems and indexing schemes; no untrusted data flow to external systems or harmful actions detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Use of in-place array modifications appears standard for performance optimization; no obfuscated code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of functions that wrap around the core HEALPix operations, converting between coordinate systems, pixel indices, and representations. The functions mainly process and return numerical data or coordinate objects, relying on well-established scientific libraries such as numpy and astropy. No code injections, network operations, or system modifications are present. The import statements and functions used are standard and do not suggest malicious intent. The code's structure is straightforward, and it handles data conversions securely. The only potential concern could be if any external input is unvalidated, but the functions seem to assume that inputs are proper numerical or coordinate data, which is typical for such a library.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a standard, scientific utility module for HEALPix coordinate and pixel operations, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a legitimate, purpose-driven implementation for astronomy or related fields, with no evidence of malware or sabotage.",
