  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of HEALPix coordinate and pixel operations, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores should reflect minimal security risk, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero. The slight elevation in security risk score in some reports (0.2) can be lowered to 0.1, aligning with the overall benign assessment."
