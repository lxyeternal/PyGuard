{
  "purpose": "The code provides a healpy-compatible interface for HEALPix operations, enabling coordinate transformations, pixel indexing, and interpolation functions commonly used in astrophysics and related fields.",
  "sources": "The code reads input coordinates (lon, lat, theta, phi), pixel indices (ipix), and vector data (x, y, z). It also processes pixel arrays for boundary calculations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks include functions that generate output such as interpolation weights and values, but there are no obvious data exfiltration or system modification actions.",
  "flows": "Input coordinates or pixel indices are transformed into other coordinate systems or pixel indices via helper functions; data flows from inputs through processing functions to outputs like weights, interpolated values, or coordinate transformations.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses in-place operations selectively to optimize performance, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. All functions are standard coordinate/pixel transformations and interpolations with no external network calls or file system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly wraps existing HEALPix functionality with coordinate transformations and interpolation utilities, utilizing astropy for units and representations. No suspicious or malicious logic is present; all operations are mathematical transformations. The code does not include network access, system commands, or data exfiltration. It performs standard, expected functions for a scientific library, with careful handling of units and data types. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured interface for HEALPix operations, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It is designed for coordinate and pixel calculations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
