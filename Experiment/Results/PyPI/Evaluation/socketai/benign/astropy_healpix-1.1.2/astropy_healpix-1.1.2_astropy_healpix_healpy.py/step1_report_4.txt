{
  "purpose": "This module provides an interface compatible with healpy for handling HEALPix data, including coordinate conversions, pixel indexing, and interpolation functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input coordinates (longitude, latitude) in functions like _lonlat_to_healpy, _healpy_to_lonlat, and get_interp_weights; reads pixel indices in functions like pix2ang, boundaries, nest2ring, ring2nest.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points include get_interp_weights and get_interp_val where untrusted input coordinates are used for interpolation; no direct data exfiltration mechanisms detected.",
  "flows": "Inputs (coordinates or pixel indices) flow into coordinate conversion functions (_healpy_to_lonlat, _lonlat_to_healpy) and interpolation functions (bilinear_interpolation_weights, interpolate_bilinear_lonlat), which process and return data. No external network or system calls are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of in-place array modifications in _lonlat_to_healpy appears safe and intended. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a wrapper around existing healpy functionality and astropy coordinate representations, providing coordinate transformations, pixel conversions, and interpolation. All functions operate on input data, converting between coordinate systems and pixel indices. Data flow is straightforward, with no external system calls, network activity, or suspicious behavior. The use of in-place array operations in _lonlat_to_healpy is noted but safe given context. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code adheres to expected patterns for such a library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard interface wrapper for healpy with coordinate conversions and pixel handling functions. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified. It appears safe and intended for scientific computation purposes.",
