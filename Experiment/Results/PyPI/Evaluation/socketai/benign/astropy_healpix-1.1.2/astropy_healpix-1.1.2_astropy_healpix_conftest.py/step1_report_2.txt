{
  "purpose": "Configure pytest behavior for the Astropy package, including setting headers and version info for testing.",
  "sources": "Reads environment data via os.path and package version from __version__, uses numpy for print options.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data flows identified; no data leaks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Configuration functions modify pytest options and numpy print settings without external data flow or malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; code appears to be standard test configuration code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily configures testing environment settings for pytest, including conditional imports, header customization, and numpy print options. It conditionally modifies the header modules if pytest_astropy_header is available and updates the version info dynamically. No suspicious functions, obfuscated patterns, or malicious logic detected. The code is straightforward and designed solely for test setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard testing configuration code with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs environment setup and configuration tasks typical for a test suite.",
