  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard configuration script for pytest, specifically tailored for the Astropy package.\n- The code performs typical setup tasks: importing modules, configuring pytest headers, setting numpy print options, and registering package version info.\n- No suspicious or malicious activities are identified across all reports.\n- The code handles optional imports gracefully and avoids dangerous operations.\n- The only potential concern is the import of `__version__` from the local package, but this is standard practice for version tracking and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code is straightforward and performs no operations that could be malicious or insecure.\n- No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- The code is not obfuscated and uses common patterns for test setup.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The only minor point is that the `__version__` import assumes the package has a `__version__` attribute, which is standard but could cause an ImportError if missing. However, this is handled gracefully.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports. No malicious code or activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 in all reports. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 or very close to it. The code is purely for configuration, with no security risks.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- Report 5 assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1, which seems slightly high given the benign nature. Since no external data or network activity is involved, this should be closer to 0.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are accurate.\n- The overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Systematic Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard configuration script with no security concerns.",
