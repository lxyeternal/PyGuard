  "purpose": "Configure pytest test suite for the Astropy package, customizing header display and numpy print options.",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__ from the local package; importing modules os, numpy, and potentially pytest_astropy_header.",
  "sinks": "Modifying the PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES dictionary; setting numpy print options; accessing __version__ from the local package.",
  "flows": "Import __version__ -> assign packagename -> update TESTED_VERSIONS; set numpy print options.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code performs typical configuration tasks. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally modifies test configuration for pytest using the pytest_astropy_header package. It updates version display settings for certain packages and sets numpy print options for reproducibility. The __version__ attribute is imported from the local package, which is standard for version tracking. The code handles ImportError gracefully and uses safe dictionary modifications. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected, such as network connections, data leaks, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration script for testing with pytest and Astropy, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
