  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pytest configuration script for an open-source package. No malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in one report reflects the reliance on local package attributes but is not indicative of actual risk. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
