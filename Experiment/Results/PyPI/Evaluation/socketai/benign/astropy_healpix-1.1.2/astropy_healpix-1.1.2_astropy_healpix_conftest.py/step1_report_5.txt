{
  "purpose": "Configure pytest for Astropy testing infrastructure, customize header modules, and set numpy print options for reproducibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`os`, `numpy`, and conditional import from `pytest_astropy_header.display`), `__version__` import from the same package, and environment variables/settings.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code modifies global configuration and package metadata.",
  "flows": "The code reads package version info and environment state, and writes configuration settings for pytest and numpy options. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code dynamically modifies package test headers and configurations but does not perform any risky operations. The import of `__version__` could be suspect if the package is malicious, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script is a configuration file for pytest within an Astropy-related package. It conditionally imports testing header modules, modifies configuration options, and sets numpy print options for reproducibility. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system harm. The code safely adjusts test display settings and package version registration. The use of `__version__` from the package is common and not suspicious. The code handles import errors gracefully and avoids executing untrusted data or code. Overall, it appears to be a benign configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign test configuration script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It safely modifies testing environment settings and package metadata without any suspicious operations.",
