{
  "purpose": "Configure pytest test suite behavior for the Astropy package, including display options and version management.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file's directory name, imports from numpy and optional pytest_astropy_header, and reads environment variables indirectly via pytest configuration.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A - no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks such as network, filesystem, or external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code mainly modifies configuration objects and sets numpy print options.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a docstring describing its purpose, then imports standard modules including os and numpy. It attempts to import optional pytest header modules, setting a flag accordingly. The 'pytest_configure' function modifies the pytest configuration by setting header options if available, adjusting module display settings, and registering the package version. It also sets numpy print options to ensure reproducibility. All operations are typical for a test configuration script, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard configuration file for setting up test environment options. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly performs configuration adjustments and version management, with no evidence of malware or security issues.",
