{
  "purpose": "Configure pytest testing environment for the Astropy package, customizing test header display and numpy print options.",
  "sources": "Reads __version__ from the local package, os.path for directory operations, numpy for configuration, and optionally imports pytest_astropy_header.display.",
  "sinks": "Modifies global variables PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES and TESTED_VERSIONS; sets numpy print options.",
  "flows": "Imports version info, modifies module display settings, and sets numpy print options during test configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Uses standard library functions and well-known testing configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets configuration options for testing, including package version display and numpy output style. It conditionally imports a testing header module, modifies a global dict, and updates version info. The logic is straightforward, with no network activity, file writing, or other typical malicious behaviors. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test configuration script for the Astropy package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only modifies testing environment variables and numpy settings.",
