  "purpose": "Configure pytest behavior for the Astropy package, including header display and numpy options.",
  "sources": "Import of __version__ from local package, os.path functions, numpy's set_printoptions, conditional import of pytest_astropy_header.display.",
  "sinks": "Modification of PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES and TESTED_VERSIONS dictionaries, setting numpy print options.",
  "flows": "Import of __version__ provides package version info; modification of header modules and test version registration; numpy print options set for reproducibility.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard configuration code. The import of __version__ assumes the package exposes this attribute, which is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard pytest configuration tasks, modifies global dictionaries for header display, registers package version, and sets numpy print options. It handles optional imports gracefully. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity are present. The use of __version__ is common for version tracking and does not pose security risks. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pytest configuration script for an open-source package. No malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in one report reflects the reliance on local package attributes but is not indicative of actual risk. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
