  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** Identifies the script as a typical setup.py, with no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The version fallback and extension handling are standard.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The confidence level is high (1).  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis. No security risk detected.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the script's role in package setup, with no external calls or malicious logic.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is standard, with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0, consistent with the code.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Focuses on version management and user guidance, no malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code handles versioning and help messages safely.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard setup pattern, with no signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code's logic is typical for setup scripts.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Again, describes a standard setup process with no suspicious code.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid. The code performs expected setup tasks without malicious intent.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** 0, no security risks or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I agree with the assessments provided. The code is a legitimate, well-structured setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**My recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and contains no indicators of supply chain threats or malicious intent.",
