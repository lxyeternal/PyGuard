  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, managing versioning, extensions, and command-line help messages.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, import statements for setup and extension helpers, get_version from setuptools_scm",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network calls, data leaks, or malicious data handling observed",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments (sys.argv) trigger help messages or version retrieval; version info flows from get_version or fallback to version string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard practices and no suspicious logic or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that handles command-line options for testing and documentation, retrieves version info via setuptools_scm with fallback, and configures extensions. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. External modules used are common in packaging workflows. The logic is simple and does not perform any network activity or data exfiltration. The fallback mechanism and help messages are standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup script with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as standard and safe.",
