  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a typical `setup.py` script for a Python package.\n- No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The version retrieval via `setuptools_scm` with fallback is standard practice.\n- No external network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection are reported or implied.\n- Help messages and command-line argument handling are straightforward and benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup script.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no malicious logic.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score = 0, security risk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data sinks, no suspicious code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup with version management.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no malicious code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- All reports correctly identify the script as a benign, standard setup script.\n- The scores assigned (malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1) are consistent with the analysis.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present.\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** Remain at 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since no security risks are identified.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is a legitimate setup script with no malicious or security issues.",
