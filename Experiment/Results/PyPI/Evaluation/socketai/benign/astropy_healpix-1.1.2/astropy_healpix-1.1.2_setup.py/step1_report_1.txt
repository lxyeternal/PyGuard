  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, managing configuration, versioning, and extension building.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, import statements for setup and helpers, environment variables (indirectly through setuptools), and external modules.",
  "sinks": "System exit calls triggered by specific command-line arguments, print statements for help messages, import and use of external modules, and dynamic version assignment.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments (sys.argv) trigger different help messages or setup behaviors, including version retrieval via get_version, which may execute external code, and configuration for extensions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic are present. The version handling with fallback is standard practice. The code includes only setup-related logic without hidden or malicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py for a Python project. It provides help messages for legacy commands, handles versioning via setuptools_scm with a fallback, and configures extensions. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The use of external modules and environment variables is appropriate for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for package configuration. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious data leaks, and no malicious behavior. It appears to be a standard, well-structured setup script for managing package metadata and extensions.",
