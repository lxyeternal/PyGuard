{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, managing installation, testing, documentation building, and versioning.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), imports environment variables, and potentially external modules for versioning (setuptools_scm).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that could leak data or execute untrusted code are present; the script mainly handles package setup.",
  "flows": "Command-line inputs are checked to provide helpful messages; version information is obtained via setuptools_scm or fallback; setup is configured accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code follows typical setup patterns with proper exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package setup script. It checks for specific commands ('test', 'build_docs'), provides helpful instructions, and manages versioning via setuptools_scm with fallback. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious intent is evident. The script only interacts with known modules and environment variables for configuration. There are no suspicious network calls, credential handling, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It manages package metadata, testing, documentation, and versioning securely and transparently.",
