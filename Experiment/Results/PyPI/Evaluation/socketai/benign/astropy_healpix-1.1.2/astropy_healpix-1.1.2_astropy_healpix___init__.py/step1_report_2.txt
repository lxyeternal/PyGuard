{
  "purpose": "To provide a BSD-licensed HEALPix implementation for Astropy, primarily serving as an import interface for core modules and version info.",
  "sources": "Imports of high_level, core, and version modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; module imports do not involve untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) which could obscure imported code's content; no explicit malicious code or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of license comments, module docstring, and straightforward imports of internal modules. The version import includes a fallback to an empty string if import fails. There are no external network calls, data processing, or command execution present. No signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The wildcard imports may obscure code origin but are common in internal package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard package initialization file with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The use of wildcard imports could obscure code origin but is typical for package __init__.py files. No malicious behavior or security concerns are evident.",
