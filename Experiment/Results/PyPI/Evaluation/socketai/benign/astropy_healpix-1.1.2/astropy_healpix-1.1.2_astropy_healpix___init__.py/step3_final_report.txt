  "purpose": "Standard package initialization for a Python module, importing submodules and setting version info.",
  "sources": "Imports from .high_level, .core, and .version modules; reading version info.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network activity, or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Module imports and version assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*), which can cause namespace pollution but are common in __init__.py files.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py for a Python package, importing internal modules and setting version info. No malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are present. Wildcard imports are noted but are standard practice in package init files. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are detected. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. Wildcard imports are a minor concern but do not constitute a security issue. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is zero.",
