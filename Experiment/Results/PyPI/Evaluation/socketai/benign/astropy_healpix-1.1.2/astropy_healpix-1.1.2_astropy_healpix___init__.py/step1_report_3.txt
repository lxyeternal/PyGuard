{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package related to HEALPix for Astropy, setting up imports and version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.high_level, .core, .version)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data handling or user input processing occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code does not process external input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The use of wildcard imports (*) can be considered a potential concern but is not inherently malicious. The try-except block for version import is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from two local modules, which is common in package initialization. The version import is wrapped in a try-except to handle missing version info gracefully. There are no suspicious or malicious operations, hardcoded credentials, or code obfuscation. The code is minimal and does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor concern is the use of wildcard imports, which could lead to namespace issues but not security problems.",
