  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Contains license comment.\n- Imports all from `.high_level` and `.core` modules using wildcard imports.\n- Attempts to import `version` from `.version`, falling back to an empty string if import fails.\n- No other logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Observations:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  The code is straightforward, typical for a package `__init__.py`. No malicious code, no data leaks, no external network calls. The wildcard imports (`from .high_level import *`) are standard in package initialization but can lead to namespace pollution; they are not inherently malicious.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The use of wildcard imports can be considered a minor flaw because it obscures which symbols are imported, potentially leading to namespace conflicts or confusion. However, this is common in package `__init__.py` files and not an error per se.\n\n- **Scores given:**\n  - Obfuscated: 0 in all reports — correct.\n  - Malware: 0 in all reports — correct.\n  - Security risk: Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting the benign nature.\n  - Confidence: 0.9 to 1 — appropriate given the straightforward analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity, benign import code, license info.  \n- **Score:** Malware 0, risk 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Note:** Correctly identifies no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above, mentions namespace pollution due to wildcard imports but considers it not malicious.  \n- **Score:** Malware 0, risk 0.1 — reasonable.  \n- **Note:** The minor concern about namespace pollution is acknowledged but not overemphasized.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to above, standard package init, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Score:** Malware 0, risk 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Note:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same conclusions, standard import behavior, no malicious code.  \n- **Score:** Malware 0, risk 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with others, standard package setup, no malicious activity.  \n- **Score:** Malware 0, risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Scores:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.05 — minimal risk, just the minor namespace pollution concern due to wildcard imports, which is typical in package `__init__.py` files.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard package initializer with no malicious intent. The minor concern about wildcard imports is acknowledged but does not constitute a security risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Risk            | 0.05           |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's safety and benign nature.",
