{
  "purpose": "The code implements a HEALPix class for spherical pixelization, providing coordinate transformations between pixel indices, celestial coordinates, Cartesian coordinates, and SkyCoord objects. It also includes spatial query functions such as cone search, boundary extraction, and neighbor identification, primarily for astronomical data processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as input_data (FITS files, arrays, or SkyCoord), healpix indices, longitude/latitude values, and SkyCoord objects; external modules like parse_input_healpix_data, frame_transform_graph, and astropy.coordinates functions.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs coordinate objects, pixel indices, and spatial query results; no external data transmission, file writes, or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parsing to coordinate transformations, pixel index calculations, and spatial queries, with internal data passing through function calls and method returns; no external data leaks or network flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors identified; code structure and dependencies are standard for astronomical data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of HEALPix functionalities, utilizing standard libraries (astropy, numpy) and proper validation/error handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. Data flows are internal, with no external data exfiltration or network activity. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior. High confidence in the legitimacy and safety of the code is justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard astronomical coordinate and HEALPix pixelization library with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
