  "purpose": "Utility functions for creating and preparing Django model instances with optional random data, supporting dynamic model resolution and custom generators.",
  "sources": "Dynamic import strings from settings, model attributes, generator functions, mock file paths.",
  "sinks": "Model creation via ORM save(), related object management, dynamic class import, execution of callables.",
  "flows": "Import strings from settings → import_from_str → model retrieval → instance creation → save or prepare methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import functions (`import_from_str`, `import_if_str`) which could be manipulated if strings are externally controlled; execution of callables for data generation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django test data utility, employing dynamic imports for extensibility. No network activity or data exfiltration is present. The dynamic import pattern introduces potential risk if configuration strings are malicious, but this is a common and accepted pattern in plugin systems. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential misuse vectors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for Django model instance creation, with minimal security concerns primarily related to dynamic import points. No signs of malware or obfuscation are present. The current scores accurately reflect the risk profile, and no adjustments are necessary.",
