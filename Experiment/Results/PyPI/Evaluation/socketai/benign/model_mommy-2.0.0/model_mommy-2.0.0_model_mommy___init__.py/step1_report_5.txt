{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and issue a deprecation warning for the 'model_mommy' package.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__version__, __title__, __author__, __license__), warnings.warn() call, import of utils module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any untrusted data sinks or external data transmission points.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks. The only action is issuing a warning and importing a utility module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only provides metadata, a warning, and an import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata variables, issues a deprecation warning to advise users to switch to 'model_bakery', and imports a utility function 'seq' from a local module. There are no signs of malicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The warning is standard for deprecated packages, and the import statement is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script with no malicious behavior. It properly informs users about deprecation and imports a utility module. No security issues are present.",
