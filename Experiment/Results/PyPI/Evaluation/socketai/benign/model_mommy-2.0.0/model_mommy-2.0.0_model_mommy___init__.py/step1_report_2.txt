  "purpose": "Define package metadata and issue a deprecation warning for the 'model_mommy' package.",
  "sources": "Metadata assignments (__version__, __title__, __author__, __license__), import statement, and warnings.warn call.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn function could potentially alert users, but it does not pose security risks.",
  "flows": "Metadata definitions are static; the deprecation warning is issued upon import, alerting users but not causing security issues.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets basic package metadata, imports a utility function, and issues a deprecation warning advising users to switch to 'model_bakery'. No dynamic code execution, no untrusted input handling, and no suspicious patterns. The only notable aspect is the deprecation warning, which is informational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as package metadata and a deprecation notice. No malicious intent or security risks identified.",
