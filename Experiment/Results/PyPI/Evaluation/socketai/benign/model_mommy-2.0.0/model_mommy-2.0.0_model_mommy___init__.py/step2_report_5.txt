  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Payloads:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, involving setting package metadata, issuing a deprecation warning, and importing a utility module.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, untrusted input handling, or malicious payloads.\n   - The import of `.utils` appears to be a local module, typical in package structures, with no indication of malicious content.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No errors or flaws are identified in the code or the reasoning. The code performs standard package setup activities.\n   - The deprecation warning is a common practice and is correctly implemented.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0 (no malicious activity)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)\n     - Security risk: 0 or very close to 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis; no changes are necessary.\n\n4. **Risk Scores Higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since no malicious activity or security issues are identified, risk scores should remain at 0 or very close to it.\n   - The one report with a securityRisk of 0.1 is slightly above zero, but given the benign nature, it could be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions and Claims:**\n   - All claims are based on static analysis; no assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are justified here.\n   - The import from a relative module `.utils` is standard, but if this module were malicious, it would be a concern. However, there's no evidence or indication of malicious code within it.\n\n6. **Overall Security Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a typical package metadata and deprecation warning script.\n   - No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n   - The deprecation warning is standard and not suspicious.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n| Score Type      | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                   | No malicious code or payloads detected.                      |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                   | Code is clear and straightforward.                            |\n| Risk            | 0                   | No security risks identified; code is benign.               |\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is entirely benign, serving as a simple package setup script with a deprecation warning.\n- No evidence supports any malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; minor adjustments could be made to set the risk score to zero for consistency.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe supply chain security incident appears to be a false alarm or a standard deprecation notice with no malicious or security concerns.",
