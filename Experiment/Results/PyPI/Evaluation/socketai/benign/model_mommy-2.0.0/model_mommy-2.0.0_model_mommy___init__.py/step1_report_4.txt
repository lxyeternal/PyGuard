  "purpose": "Define package metadata and issue a deprecation warning for the 'model_mommy' package.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements for __version__, __title__, __author__, __license__; import statement for warnings; import of .utils.seq.",
  "sinks": "Warning issued via warnings.warn; import statement potentially sourcing external code from relative module.",
  "flows": "Metadata variables are set internally; warnings.warn triggers a deprecation warning; import of .utils.seq loads external code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings.warn to notify deprecation is normal; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code observed; import from relative module could be benign or malicious, but nothing suspicious is evident here.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata attributes, issues a deprecation warning encouraging users to switch to another package, and imports a utility function from a relative module. The warning is standard practice for deprecated packages. No input/output sources, untrusted data flows, or suspicious behaviors are present. The import statement is typical for Python packages and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard package setup activities: defining metadata and issuing a deprecation warning. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The warning is legitimate and expected. Overall, this code appears safe.",
