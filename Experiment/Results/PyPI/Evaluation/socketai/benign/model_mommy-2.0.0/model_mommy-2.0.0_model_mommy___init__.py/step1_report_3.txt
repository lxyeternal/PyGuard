  "purpose": "Define package metadata and issue a deprecation warning for the 'model_mommy' package.",
  "sources": "Module metadata assignments (__version__, __title__, __author__, __license__) and the warnings.warn() call.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn() function could potentially be a sink if it outputs to untrusted locations, but here it only issues a deprecation warning.",
  "flows": "Metadata assignments are static; the warnings.warn() executes at import time but does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard practice of setting metadata and issuing warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata variables and emits a deprecation warning message. It imports a local utility module. There is no indication of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code flows. The warning message is hardcoded, which is normal. No untrusted data is processed or output, and no malicious code or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward package metadata declaration with a deprecation warning. There are no malicious behaviors or security concerns present.",
