  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe a straightforward package metadata setup with a deprecation warning.\n- No dynamic code execution, untrusted input handling, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The code imports a local utility module, which is standard practice.\n- The deprecation warning is a common, benign notification.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. The code is benign.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, confidence 0.9, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Justification:** The mention of relative import (`from .utils import seq`) could, in theory, be suspicious if the module were malicious, but this is standard in Python packages. No actual malicious activity is observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0\n- **Verdict:** Slightly overcautious but not unreasonable. The minimal risk score is acceptable given the relative import, but it doesn't indicate malicious intent.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; all should have malware=0.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; all should be 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the straightforward nature, all should have a risk score close to 0. The only exception is Report 4, which assigns 0.1 possibly due to the relative import. While this is conservative, it is acceptable since the import could, in rare cases, be malicious if the package were compromised, but there's no evidence here.\n\n### **Final Justification & Adjusted Scores:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  | Justification                                              |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0      | No malicious activity, straightforward code.               |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0      | Same as above.                                              |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0      | Same as above.                                              |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.1    | Slight caution due to relative import, but no evidence of malicious intent. |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0      | Same as others.                                              |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All should be **0**.\n- **Obfuscated:** All should be **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Most should be **0**, with Report 4 possibly at **0.1** due to the relative import, but this is a conservative estimate rather than an indication of actual risk.\n\n**Final assessment:** The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The current scores are mostly accurate, with minor adjustments for risk in Report 4.",
