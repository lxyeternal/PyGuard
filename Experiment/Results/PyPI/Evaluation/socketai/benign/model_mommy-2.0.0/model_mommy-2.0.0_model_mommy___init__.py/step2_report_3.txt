  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose:** Metadata definition and deprecation warning.  \n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, no dynamic execution, no untrusted inputs. The warning is informational.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully benign. The score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as above.  \n- **Analysis:** Static metadata, warning at import, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as above.  \n- **Analysis:** Similar to previous, no malicious activity, only a deprecation warning.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct scores.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as above.  \n- **Analysis:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but no malicious behavior. The import of a relative module (`.utils.seq`) is standard, though it could be examined further, but nothing suspicious is indicated.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated risk score is acceptable given the import, but no malicious activity is evident. The malware score remains zero.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as above.  \n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity, standard deprecation warning, benign import.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk Score:** All are very low, mostly zero, with a minor 0.1 in one case due to the import statement, which is acceptable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code is straightforward package metadata and a deprecation warning, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.  \n- The minor risk score of 0.1 in report 4 can be justified by the import of a relative module, which could potentially be a vector if the module is malicious, but no evidence suggests so here.  \n- Malware scores should remain at 0, as there's no malicious payload.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with report 4's score, justified by the import, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
