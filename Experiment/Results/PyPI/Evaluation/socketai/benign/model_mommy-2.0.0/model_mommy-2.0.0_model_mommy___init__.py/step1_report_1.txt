{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and issue a deprecation warning for the 'model_mommy' package.",
  "sources": "Metadata assignments (__version__, __title__, __author__, __license__), warnings.warn() call, import of utils module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any untrusted data sinks or output that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks that could cause security issues; the code mainly sets metadata and issues a warning.",
  "anomalies": "The only noteworthy point is the deprecation warning, but it is standard and not malicious; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata variables, issues a DeprecationWarning advising to switch to another package, and imports a utility module. There are no dynamic code executions, untrusted inputs, or potentially malicious constructs. The warning message is informational, not malicious. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package metadata and warning script with no malicious intent. The deprecation warning is normal for transitioning packages. Overall security risk is negligible.",
