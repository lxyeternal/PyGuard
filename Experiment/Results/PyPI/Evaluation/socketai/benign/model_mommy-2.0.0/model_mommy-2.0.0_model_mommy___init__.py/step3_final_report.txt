  "purpose": "Package metadata definition with a deprecation warning advising users to switch to 'model_bakery'.",
  "sources": "Package metadata variables (__version__, __title__, __author__, __license__), and the import statement 'from .utils import seq'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets variables, issues a warning, and imports a local module.",
  "anomalies": "The relative import '.utils' could be scrutinized, but is standard in package structures; no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining package metadata, issuing a deprecation warning, and importing a local utility module. There are no dynamic code executions, untrusted inputs, or suspicious behaviors. The import of '.utils' is typical for package internal modules. The warning is standard practice. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup script with a deprecation warning and local import. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores should be uniformly 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk, with the minor risk score of 0.1 in one report being adjusted to 0 for consistency.",
