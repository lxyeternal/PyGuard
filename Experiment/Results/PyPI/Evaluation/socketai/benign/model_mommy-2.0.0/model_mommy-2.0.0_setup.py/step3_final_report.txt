  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'model_mommy'.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'model_mommy.__version__', dependencies from 'requirements.txt', description from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Static data reads; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'open()' without context managers; no validation or sanitization of file contents.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with straightforward file reads and module attribute access. It does not execute untrusted input, perform network operations, or include obfuscated/malicious code. The only minor concern is the absence of context managers for file handling, which is a best practice but not a security issue. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
