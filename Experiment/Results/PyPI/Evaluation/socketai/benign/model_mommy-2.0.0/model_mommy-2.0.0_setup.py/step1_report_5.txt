{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'model_mommy' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading __version__ from model_mommy, reading requirements.txt and README.rst files.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the setup process involves file reads and package metadata assignments.",
  "flows": "Read version and description files -> use data in setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and os.path functions, then loads the version from the model_mommy module. It reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and description from 'README.rst'. The setup() call configures package metadata, dependencies, author info, and classifiers. All operations are standard for Python package setup. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no suspicious network activity, and no malicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It is safe and standard in structure.",
