{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for the Python package 'model_mommy', defining its metadata, dependencies, and packaging instructions.",
  "sources": "Reading the package version from model_mommy.__version__, reading dependencies from 'requirements.txt', and reading long description from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only reads static files and assigns values to setup parameters.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads ('requirements.txt' and 'README.rst') into the setup configuration parameters; no data is sent or processed beyond local file reads.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. Usage of dynamic file reading is standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads version info and long description from static files, and calls setuptools.setup with package metadata. All operations are standard for packaging Python projects. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data processing is involved. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code injections.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any suspicious behavior.",
