{
  "purpose": "This script configures the packaging and installation of the 'model_mommy' Python package, including reading dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from model_mommy.__version__, reads 'requirements.txt', reads 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no network or system modification actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; mainly static file reading and package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() to read files for dependencies and description; no validation or sanitization, but typical in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and os.path modules, then imports the 'model_mommy' package to access its version. It calls setuptools.setup() to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. Dependencies are read from 'requirements.txt' dynamically, which is a standard pattern. No user input, environment variables, or network activities are involved. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected; the code performs straightforward package setup tasks with no hidden or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It reads local files for dependencies and package info, which is typical for Python package setup scripts.",
