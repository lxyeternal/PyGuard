{
  "purpose": "The code is used for setting up and configuring the 'model_mommy' Python package, primarily for packaging and distribution purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads the version from the model_mommy module, reads requirements from 'requirements.txt', and reads the long description from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data or executes untrusted code directly. The only potential sink could be the installation process which depends on external files.",
  "flows": "The code reads version info and long description from files and module; these are used during setup but do not involve data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations. External files ('requirements.txt' and 'README.rst') are standard in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and 'model_mommy' to configure package setup parameters. It reads the version dynamically from 'model_mommy.__version__' and loads dependencies and description from local files. All actions are typical for a Python package setup script. There is no code execution based on external untrusted input, no network activity, and no suspicious behaviors observed. The usage of 'open' to read files is standard practice and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads package metadata and dependencies from local files and a module, which is common and safe.",
