  "purpose": "Utility functions for dynamic importing of modules and objects, and a sequence generator for datetime or numeric values.",
  "sources": "Input strings for import functions; datetime or numeric values for sequence generation.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import functions can execute untrusted code if input is malicious; the sequence generator could cause resource exhaustion if misused.",
  "flows": "Import string input -> import_from_str or import_if_str -> dynamic module loading; datetime/numeric input -> seq generator -> yield values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import functions with untrusted input without validation; infinite generator in seq could be exploited for resource exhaustion.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for dynamic module import and sequence generation based on datetime or numeric types. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The main security concern is the potential misuse of dynamic import functions if supplied with untrusted input, which could lead to code execution or resource exhaustion. The sequence generator handles datetime and numeric types safely but could be exploited if fed malicious data. The code's structure and logic are straightforward, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2 are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is cautious handling of untrusted input for dynamic imports. The existing scores are justified and should be maintained.",
