  "purpose": "Utility functions for dynamic import and generating sequential date/time or numeric series.",
  "sources": "import_if_str, import_from_str functions reading input parameters; possibly external input if invoked with untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "getattr() used for dynamic attribute access, importlib.import_module for dynamic imports, itertools.count for generating sequences.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (import_string_or_obj, import_string, value, increment_by) flow into functions, possibly into dynamic import or attribute access, and sequence generation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import and getattr may pose risks if untrusted input is supplied; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions to dynamically import modules/objects and generate sequences based on date, time, or numeric values. The import_if_str function conditionally calls import_from_str, which performs dynamic import using importlib and getattr, both of which are common but can be risky if inputs are untrusted. The seq function creates date/time or numeric sequences, using itertools.count, which is safe but potentially misused if user-controlled inputs are malicious. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. No obfuscation or hidden malicious behavior observed. The dynamic import mechanisms could be exploited if supplied with malicious strings, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily utility functions for dynamic importing and sequence generation with standard patterns. No malicious intent or malware is evident; the main concern is potential misuse if input parameters are untrusted, but this is typical for such utility functions. Overall security risk is low.",
