  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected.",
    "Use of dynamic import could be exploited if input strings are untrusted, but this alone isn't malicious.",
    "Infinite generator in seq could be misused if fed untrusted or malicious data, but the code itself does not contain malicious logic."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code performs dynamic imports and generates sequences for datetime or numeric values. The import functions use standard Python mechanisms and do not include malicious logic. The seq function calculates time-based sequences and uses itertools.count for numeric sequences, which could be exploited if inputs are maliciously crafted, but the code itself is not inherently malicious. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The dynamic import feature warrants cautious use but is common in flexible code bases.",
  "conclusion": "The code is utility-focused, with standard patterns for dynamic importing and sequence generation. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior; the primary concern is the potential misuse of dynamic import with untrusted input, but this does not constitute malicious intent within the code itself.",
