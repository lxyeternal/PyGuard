  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for dynamic module importing, object retrieval, and generating sequences based on date/time or numeric values.",
  "sources": "User-provided import string in import_if_str and import_from_str functions; input parameters to seq function (value and increment_by).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, but importlib.import_module and getattr could be misused if provided with malicious strings; the seq function generates date/time or numeric sequences which could be misused in loops.",
  "flows": "Input strings or objects flow into import_if_str -> import_from_str for dynamic import; values and increment_by flow into seq to generate sequences based on type.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The import functions perform standard dynamic imports. The seq function’s use of itertools.count with date/time calculations could be exploited in resource exhaustion if misused with malicious input, but this is a standard pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for dynamic importing and sequence generation. import_if_str checks if input is a string, then dynamically imports the specified module and attribute. import_from_str performs a standard import. seq generates a sequence based on the type of input: date, time, or numeric. The implementation uses standard Python libraries and patterns. No evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads is present. The dynamic import mechanism is typical for plugin systems, but if misused, could load malicious modules; however, this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It employs common patterns for dynamic imports and sequence generation. No security risks or malicious intent are evident based on this isolated snippet.",
