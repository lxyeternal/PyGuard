  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for dynamic importing and generating sequences based on datetime or numeric values.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module, input string for import_from_str, possibly external data if import strings are externally supplied.",
  "sinks": "getattr for dynamic attribute access, importlib.import_module for dynamic module import.",
  "flows": "import_string_or_obj -> import_from_str (if string) -> importlib.import_module -> getattr",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; straightforward dynamic import and sequence generation.",
  "analysis": "The code allows dynamic importing of modules and attributes based on input strings, which is common in plugin architectures but could be misused if user-controlled strings are used unsafely. The sequence generator handles datetime and numeric types, converting datetime objects to epoch or date/time values, and yields sequences accordingly. No malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are observed. The import functions are standard utility functions, and the sequence generator performs time-based or numeric sequences without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility code with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It relies on standard Python modules and practices. Potential security concerns could arise if input strings for imports are externally controlled and untrusted, which might lead to code injection if misused, but this is a common pattern in plugin systems. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
