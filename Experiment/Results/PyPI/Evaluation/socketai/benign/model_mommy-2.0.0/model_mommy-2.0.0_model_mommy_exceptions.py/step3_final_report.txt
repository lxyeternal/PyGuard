{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception, serving as specific error indicators within an application.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code contains only class definitions with no data reading or external data handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process or output data, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows; there are no source-to-sink paths as the code solely declares exception classes without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the classes are straightforward, empty subclasses with no embedded logic or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with no dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the benign and straightforward nature of this code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0—are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the lack of any suspicious features or complex logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes used for error handling. There are no malicious, obfuscated, or security-related issues present. The reports and scores are accurate and appropriate, requiring no modifications.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
