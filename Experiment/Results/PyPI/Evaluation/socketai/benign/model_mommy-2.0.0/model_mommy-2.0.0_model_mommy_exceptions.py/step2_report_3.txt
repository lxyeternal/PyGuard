  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the corresponding reports carefully.\n\n**Code Overview:**\nThe code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. Each class is an empty subclass, serving as a specific error indicator, such as `RecipeNotFound`, `ModelNotFound`, etc.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n\n- **Confirm if issues are present:**  \n  The code contains only class definitions for exceptions, with no dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions.  \n  **Conclusion:** There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors present in this code.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**\n\n- **Logical correctness:**  \n  The reports consistently state that the code is straightforward, standard for error handling, and free of suspicious or malicious constructs.  \n- **Potential oversight:**  \n  The reports do not mention that these classes are empty and could be extended or misused if imported improperly, but as is, they are benign.  \n- **No significant flaws:**  \n  The reports seem accurate and thorough, correctly identifying the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.  \n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is correct.  \n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign a risk score of 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \nThe scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**\n\n- Since the code only defines exception classes with no dynamic or malicious behavior, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.  \n- Any higher score would be unjustified unless the code was part of a malicious payload or contained obfuscated, suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Challenging Claims Based on Assumptions**\n\n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent, simply describing the code as error handling classes.  \n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n\n- All reports assign consistent scores:  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security risk: 0  \n- The confidence levels are high (1), which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment & Personal Estimate**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions. The reports are accurate and comprehensive, correctly assessing the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                               |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                 | No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.                  |\n| Security Risk   | 0                 | No security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors detected.   |\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe current reports and scores are appropriate and accurate. No adjustments are necessary.",
