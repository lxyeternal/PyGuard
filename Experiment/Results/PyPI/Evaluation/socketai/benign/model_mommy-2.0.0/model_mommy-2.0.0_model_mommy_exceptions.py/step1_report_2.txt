  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to recipes, models, quantities, and custom mummies.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network connections, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as this code only defines exception classes without any data processing or control flow.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are simple exception definitions with no unusual code or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class declarations inheriting from Exception, serving as specialized error types. There are no input sources, data flows, or sinks. The classes are straightforward and serve typical error handling purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely defining custom exceptions with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard practice for error handling in Python projects.",
