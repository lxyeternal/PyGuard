  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a recipe or model management system.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data output points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink pathways since the code only declares exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class declarations, which are standard in Python for handling specific error cases. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, or any suspicious activity. The code does not include any hardcoded credentials, network operations, or other malicious constructs. Overall, it is straightforward and typical exception class definitions without any signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only standard exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks present. It appears to be part of a larger application for handling specific errors related to recipes or models, with no suspicious or malicious features.",
