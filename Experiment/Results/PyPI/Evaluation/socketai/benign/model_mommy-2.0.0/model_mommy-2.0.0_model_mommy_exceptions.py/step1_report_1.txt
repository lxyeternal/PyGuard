{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions in an application, likely related to recipes and models.",
  "sources": "No input sources are present; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions are present; no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data handling; only class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward class declarations without dynamic or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception base class. These classes are likely used elsewhere in the application to handle specific error conditions such as missing recipes, empty iterators, or invalid inputs. There are no input sources, no data processing, no suspicious behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The structure is simple, clear, and typical for error handling in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any data handling, network operations, or other potentially dangerous actions.",
