  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions related to recipes, models, and custom objects.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data fetching sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No output, data leaks, or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior detected. The code solely defines exception classes without any embedded logic, data handling, or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception base class. These classes are standard and serve as specific error indicators. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions. No signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a typical error handling setup for a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, straightforward, and intended for error handling within an application. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks.",
