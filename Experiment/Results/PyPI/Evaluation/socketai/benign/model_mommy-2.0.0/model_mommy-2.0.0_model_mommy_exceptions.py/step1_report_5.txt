  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application, likely related to recipes, models, and custom objects.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only class definitions and exception declarations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing occurring.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code solely defines exception classes without any runtime logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's base Exception class. These classes are empty and serve as specific error indicators. There are no operations, data manipulations, or external interactions. The absence of dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns indicates that this code is solely for error handling and does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines custom exception classes for structured error handling, with no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks.",
