  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the corresponding reports carefully.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code only defines custom exception classes inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n- No input sources, data processing, or data sinks are present.\n- No dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The classes are straightforward and serve as error indicators.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic or Reasoning:**\n- The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.\n- They correctly identify that these are simple exception class definitions with no embedded logic.\n- No errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n**3. Scores Assigned to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate given the code.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n- These scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- The risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate because:\n  - No malicious activity\n  - No security vulnerabilities\n  - No obfuscation or suspicious behavior\n- Therefore, no justification is needed for higher scores.\n\n**5. Malware Score Reflection:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious code.\n- The code is purely class definitions for error handling.\n\n**6. Challenging Assumptions about Vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly conclude the code is benign.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential issues.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.\n- The reports' conclusions match the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Remarks:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code, I agree with the assessments provided. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, straightforward set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
