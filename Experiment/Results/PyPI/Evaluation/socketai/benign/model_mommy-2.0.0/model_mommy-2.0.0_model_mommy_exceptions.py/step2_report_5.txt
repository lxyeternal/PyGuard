  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the underlying code and reasoning.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code consists solely of simple custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception class.\n- No data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- No dynamic, obfuscated, or malicious code patterns are detected.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and intended for error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The reports correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No. The reasoning is consistent and accurate: the code is straightforward, and no security issues are apparent.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**  \n  Correctly assigned as 0; no malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign a risk score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities:**  \n  None of the reports claim any vulnerabilities or potential exploits, which is accurate.\n\n- **Consistency:**  \n  The scores and conclusions are consistent across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Is there any reason to adjust scores?**  \n  No. The code is purely declarative, defining exception classes, with no suspicious features.\n\n- **Are the conclusions justified?**  \n  Yes. The conclusion that this code is benign and poses no security risk is fully supported.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, just for completeness, but effectively zero risk)\n\nThe code is a standard pattern in Python projects for structured error handling, with no malicious or obfuscating elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is harmless, straightforward, and contains no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. They correctly reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that in larger contexts, exception classes are used appropriately, but in this isolated snippet, there's no concern.",
