  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and cross-verify the code and the reasoning provided.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's `Exception`. There are no data flows, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - The reports correctly identify that there are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and typical for error handling.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The reports uniformly assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is justified.\n   - Since the code is purely exception class definitions with no runtime logic, no elevated risk scores are warranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that there is no malware activity.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, network calls, or obfuscation.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to the facts: class definitions with no suspicious behaviors.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or code hiding)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall Justification:**\n\nThe code is a standard set of custom exception classes used for error handling in a Python application. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI agree with the given scores. No adjustments are necessary. The code is safe, straightforward, and typical for its purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code poses no security concerns based on the provided analysis.",
