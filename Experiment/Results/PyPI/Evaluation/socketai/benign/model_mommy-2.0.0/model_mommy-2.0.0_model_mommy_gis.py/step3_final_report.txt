  "purpose": "Conditional setup for GIS data generation in Django, mapping GIS model fields to generator functions from 'random_gen' for testing or mocking spatial data.",
  "sources": "The import of 'django.contrib.gis' modules, and the 'random_gen' module functions used within the mapping.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the code only assigns functions for data generation.",
  "flows": "GIS field classes are mapped to 'random_gen' functions when 'django.contrib.gis' is installed; no external data flow or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; the code is straightforward. The only potential concern is the 'random_gen' module, whose contents are unknown.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports GIS modules and maps GIS field classes to functions from 'random_gen', likely for generating mock spatial data. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, testing-oriented nature of the code. The primary uncertainty hinges on the safety of 'random_gen', which cannot be verified here but shows no signs of malicious activity in this context. The code is standard for Django GIS data mocking, with no network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Overall, the code is safe, and the low security risk score is justified, assuming 'random_gen' is trustworthy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup for GIS data generation in Django projects, with no malicious activity detected. The scores are appropriate, and the main concern is verifying the safety of 'random_gen'. Overall, it poses minimal security risk.",
