  "purpose": "Configure GIS-related field mappings in a Django application, conditionally importing modules and functions based on installed apps.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, django.apps, and the local module .random_gen; accessing django.contrib.gis.db.models for GIS field classes.",
  "sinks": "Assigning functions from random_gen to the default_gis_mapping dictionary, potentially for generating random geometry data.",
  "flows": "Code checks if 'django.contrib.gis' is installed; if so, imports GIS fields and assigns corresponding generator functions from random_gen to the default_gis_mapping entries.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or hidden actions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports GIS modules and functions based on the presence of 'django.contrib.gis'. It assigns generator functions from a local module 'random_gen' to a mapping dictionary intended for GIS fields. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. The import of 'random_gen' could be scrutinized if its content is unknown, but based on this code alone, it appears to be a utility for generating random geometries. No external data is read, and no sensitive information is accessed or transmitted. The logic appears intended for testing or data generation purposes within a Django GIS application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration for conditional GIS support in Django, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
