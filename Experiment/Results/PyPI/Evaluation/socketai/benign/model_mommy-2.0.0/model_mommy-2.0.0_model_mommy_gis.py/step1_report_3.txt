{
  "purpose": "This code conditionally imports GIS-related modules and functions, and maps specific GIS field types to functions for generating geometrical data, likely for testing or data population purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the installed apps list via apps.is_installed, and conditionally imports the 'random_gen' module.",
  "sinks": "The imported functions from 'random_gen' are mapped into 'default_gis_mapping' for potential use elsewhere, possibly for data generation. No direct data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Conditional import of 'random_gen' and its functions, with mappings stored in 'default_gis_mapping', depending on whether 'django.contrib.gis' is installed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script first checks if 'django.contrib.gis' is installed using 'apps.is_installed'. If true, it imports a 'random_gen' module and GIS field classes from Django. It then maps each GIS field class to a corresponding 'random_gen' function, probably for generating sample or test geometrical data. No suspicious behavior, external data transmission, or malicious code is evident. The code appears intended for data generation or testing within a Django project, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious configuration for conditional data generation related to GIS fields in Django. There are no indicators of malware or security threats. It appears safe and purposeful.",
