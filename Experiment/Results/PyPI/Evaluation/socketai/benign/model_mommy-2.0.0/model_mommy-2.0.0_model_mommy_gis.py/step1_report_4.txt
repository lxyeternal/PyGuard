  "purpose": "Configure GIS-related model fields with corresponding random data generators if GIS support is enabled in a Django project.",
  "sources": "Import statements, conditional import of 'random_gen' module, and usage of 'apps.is_installed' check.",
  "sinks": "Calls to functions within 'random_gen' such as 'gen_geometry', 'gen_point', etc., which generate random spatial data.",
  "flows": "Check if 'django.contrib.gis' is installed -> import 'random_gen' -> assign functions from 'random_gen' to 'default_gis_mapping' based on GIS fields.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code or backdoors. The 'random_gen' module is imported dynamically if GIS is installed, but no further details are provided about its content.",
  "analysis": "The code checks whether the Django GIS module is installed, then imports a 'random_gen' module and assigns its functions to generate various GIS data types. There are no apparent malicious behaviors, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification. The only external dependency ('random_gen') is used for data generation, which appears to be for testing or data mocking purposes. The code structure is standard, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Without details of 'random_gen', the evaluation cannot confirm whether it contains malicious code, but the usage pattern here appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for setting up GIS field data generation with no immediate signs of malicious activity or security risks. It dynamically imports a module likely intended for data mocking or testing. No malicious behaviors are evident, and the structure appears typical for such use cases.",
