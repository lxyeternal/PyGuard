{
  "purpose": "The code conditionally imports GIS-related modules and assigns generator functions to a mapping for GIS fields if the Django GIS app is installed.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration via 'apps.is_installed' and imports modules including 'random_gen' and Django GIS fields.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns functions from 'random_gen' to a dictionary mapping GIS fields, which could be used to generate data.",
  "flows": "If 'MOMMY_GIS' is true, it imports 'random_gen' and maps GIS fields to generator functions from 'random_gen', which could be invoked elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are detected. Usage of 'random_gen' is standard for data generation, not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script checks if the Django GIS app is installed, then dynamically imports a module called 'random_gen' and maps GIS field types to corresponding generator functions. The purpose appears to be data generation or mocking for GIS models. There is no evidence of malicious code, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation. The 'random_gen' module's functions are invoked for data generation, which is common in testing scenarios. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical conditional setup for GIS data mocking, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and intended for test data generation.",
