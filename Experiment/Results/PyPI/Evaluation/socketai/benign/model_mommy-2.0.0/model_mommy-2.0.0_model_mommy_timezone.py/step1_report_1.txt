{
  "purpose": "The code provides support for timezone-aware datetime objects in Django applications, with compatibility for Django versions 1.4+ and fallback behavior if Django is not installed.",
  "sources": "Reads Django settings (settings.USE_TZ) and input arguments for datetime creation",
  "sinks": "Returns datetime objects, possibly with timezone info attached",
  "flows": "Input arguments to datetime -> tz_aware function checks settings -> potentially modifies datetime with timezone info",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; use of try-except for import handling is standard; no obfuscated or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports Django modules and defines utility functions for timezone-aware datetimes. If Django is present, it uses Django's timezone utilities; otherwise, it defaults to naive datetime. The tz_aware function only modifies the datetime if settings.USE_TZ is True, attaching UTC timezone info. There are no external data sources or sinks that could leak data or be exploited. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard Django practices. No anomalies or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for handling timezone-aware datetimes in Django. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. Its design is conventional and safe.",
