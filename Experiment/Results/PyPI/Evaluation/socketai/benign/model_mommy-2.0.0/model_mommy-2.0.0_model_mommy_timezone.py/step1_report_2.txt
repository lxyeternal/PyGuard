{
  "purpose": "Provide support for timezone-aware datetimes in Django 1.4+ and fallback for non-Django environments.",
  "sources": "Import statements from django.conf and django.utils.timezone, function arguments in smart_datetime and tz_aware.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted input directly or output data in a risky manner.",
  "flows": "The code checks for Django settings to determine if timezone-aware datetimes are needed, and modifies datetime objects accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code conditionally uses Django-specific functions and defaults to standard datetime in absence of Django, which is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to enhance datetime handling with timezone awareness, relying on Django's timezone utilities when available. It includes fallback logic for environments without Django, ensuring compatibility. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code does not process untrusted input nor execute dynamic code; it solely manipulates datetime objects based on configuration settings. The import error handling is standard and does not introduce security issues. Overall, the code appears benign, focused on datetime utility functions without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for handling timezone-aware datetimes in Django, with appropriate fallbacks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is well-structured for its purpose and does not pose a security threat.",
