  "purpose": "Provides support for timezone-aware datetimes in Django 1.4+ and handles fallback when Django is not installed.",
  "sources": "Reads Django settings (settings.USE_TZ), uses datetime.now(), and processes datetime objects.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data flows into untrusted sources that could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code mainly defines functions and imports, with conditional handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The code uses standard library functions and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to support timezone-aware datetime objects in Django projects. It conditionally imports Django modules and defines fallback functions if Django is absent. The tz_aware function modifies datetime objects based on Django settings, specifically adjusting for timezone awareness. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code's logic is straightforward and pertains to timezone handling. No external data sources or sinks that could lead to security risks are involved. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for handling timezone-aware datetimes in Django projects, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
