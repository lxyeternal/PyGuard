{
  "purpose": "Provides support for Django 1.4+ safe datetimes, enabling timezone-aware datetime objects based on Django settings.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.conf and django.utils.timezone, as well as the datetime module; reading settings.USE_TZ.",
  "sinks": "Returns tz-aware datetime objects; no direct sinks that could cause data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Reads settings.USE_TZ, then creates datetime objects which may be made timezone-aware depending on settings.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import fallback defines now() function; no suspicious or unusual code detected. The comment suggests deprecation, but it is not executed.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports Django timezone utilities and defines functions to create timezone-aware datetimes. It adjusts datetime objects based on Django settings. No external input processing, no insecure operations, or obfuscation present. The fallback now() function only returns current time without timezone info, which is acceptable. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for managing timezone-aware datetimes in Django. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, utility-focused module.",
