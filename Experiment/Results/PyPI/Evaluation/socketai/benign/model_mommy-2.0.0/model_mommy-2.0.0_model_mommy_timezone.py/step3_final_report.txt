  "purpose": "Support for Django 1.4+ timezone-aware datetimes with fallback for non-Django environments.",
  "sources": "Import statements for django.conf.settings and django.utils.timezone; usage of settings.USE_TZ; the call to datetime.now() in fallback.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or output data that could leak or be exploited.",
  "flows": "The function tz_aware() reads the datetime object and, if USE_TZ is True, attaches utc tzinfo; smart_datetime() creates a datetime and passes it to tz_aware().",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicating the file may be unnecessary is benign; no suspicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports Django modules, providing fallback definitions if Django isn't installed. It uses settings.USE_TZ to determine whether to attach utc tzinfo to datetime objects. The fallback now() function is simple and safe. No external data sources, network calls, or data leaks are present. The code adheres to standard practices and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for handling timezone-aware datetimes in Django, with fallback support. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
