  "purpose": "Provide support for timezone-aware datetimes in Django 1.4+ projects, with fallback for environments without Django.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django settings and timezone functions, and the functions smart_datetime and tz_aware that generate or modify datetime objects.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifying datetime objects with tzinfo based on Django settings; no direct data sinks or outputs evident.",
  "flows": "Input args to smart_datetime -> creation of datetime object -> tz_aware modifies tzinfo based on settings.USE_TZ",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional import and fallback to default datetime.now() could be seen as unusual but is acceptable. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation present. The comment suggests the file might be deprecated, but no active malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for handling timezone-aware datetimes, integrating with Django's timezone support when available. It safely falls back if Django isn't present. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward, handling datetime objects and respecting Django's timezone settings. No external data or untrusted inputs are processed. No code injection, data leaks, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed for compatibility with Django timezone support. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of a TODO comment indicates potential deprecation but no malicious intent.",
