{
  "purpose": "The code defines mappings between Django model fields and functions that generate random data for testing or seeding databases.",
  "sources": "Imports various Django model fields and functions from local modules; reads field types from Django models; reads configuration from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Calls to functions like random_gen.gen_* which generate data; no direct sinks of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Field types are mapped to data generation functions; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mappings are static.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. The code imports optional modules conditionally; no obfuscated or dynamic code execution; the functions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a static mapping between Django field types and functions that generate random data. It imports various modules, some optionally (PostgreSQL-specific fields, GIS fields), and defines functions to add custom mappings and retrieve them. The purpose appears to be for data generation or testing, not for malicious activity. No data is read from untrusted sources or written to external systems. The only dynamic aspect is the optional importing of modules and user-defined mappings, which do not pose security risks. There is no evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. All imported modules are standard or local, and the code is well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup for mapping Django model fields to data generators, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It performs configuration and utility functions without processing untrusted input or executing harmful operations.",
