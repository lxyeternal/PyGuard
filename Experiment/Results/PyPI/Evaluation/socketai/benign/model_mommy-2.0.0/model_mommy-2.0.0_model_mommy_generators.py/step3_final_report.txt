  "purpose": "Mapping Django ORM fields to functions generating random data for testing or seeding purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports of Django model fields, optional PostgreSQL fields, and the 'import_if_str' function for dynamic import.",
  "sinks": "The 'import_if_str' function potentially executing dynamic code based on string input.",
  "flows": "Mapping of field types to generator functions; use of 'import_if_str' to assign functions dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import_if_str' for dynamic imports, which could execute arbitrary code if misused; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mappings from Django ORM fields to data generator functions, supporting optional PostgreSQL and GIS fields via conditional imports. The 'import_if_str' function is used to assign functions dynamically based on string input, which could pose security risks if inputs are untrusted. The overall structure is straightforward, intended for test data generation, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the potential misuse of 'import_if_str', but in controlled environments, it appears safe. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, reflecting benign intent. The security risk score is set at 0.2 to account for the dynamic import mechanism, which warrants cautious validation to prevent execution of untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for mapping Django ORM fields to data generators, primarily for testing. No malware or malicious activity is detected. The main consideration is ensuring 'import_if_str' is used securely to prevent execution of untrusted code. The overall security posture is low risk, with a slight caution due to dynamic imports.",
