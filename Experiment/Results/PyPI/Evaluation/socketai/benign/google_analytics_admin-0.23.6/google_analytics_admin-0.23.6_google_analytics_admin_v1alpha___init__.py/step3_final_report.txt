{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an index module for the Google Analytics Admin SDK, organizing and exposing classes, types, and services for use in client applications.",
  "sources": "The code imports version info, classes, and types from official Google SDK libraries, primarily from 'google.analytics.admin_v1alpha' and related modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no runtime operations, data processing, or external data sinks; the code only performs static import and export of classes and constants.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to static import/export statements, with no dynamic data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The license header and structure are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK module that defines and exports classes, types, and constants related to Google Analytics Admin API. It contains no executable logic, network calls, or data handling involving untrusted sources. The structure is static and organizational, serving as an interface layer for the SDK. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely as an organizational index for SDK components, with no runtime or data flow concerns.",
