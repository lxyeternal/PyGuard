  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a module defining and exporting classes/types for Google Analytics Admin API.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime execution, network calls, or data handling—just imports and exports.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward SDK module, benign, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion that the code is benign and poses no security risk is accurate. The malware score should be **0**. The obfuscated score is **0** as well.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code is an import module organizing SDK components.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard SDK interface, benign, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the report is accurate. Malware score remains **0**, obfuscated **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Properly describes the code as defining the public API, importing version info, classes, and types.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime logic or data flows involving untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical SDK interface, benign.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe conclusion is correct. Malware score **0**, obfuscated **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a package __init__.py or API index module.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard, benign, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe conclusion aligns with the code's nature. Malware score **0**, obfuscated **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate, describes the code as an index/organizer for API components.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling or runtime logic.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, standard package module.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe conclusion is appropriate. Malware score **0**, obfuscated **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are correctly 0, as the code is straightforward import/export statements.\n- **Risk Scores:** Since there's no malicious behavior, the overall security risk should be **0** for all.\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\nThe code is a standard SDK module, importing classes/types from the Google Analytics Admin API library and exposing them via `__all__`. It contains no dynamic code, network calls, or untrusted input handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or sabotage.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, safe, and serves as a structured API interface. No security concerns are evident.",
