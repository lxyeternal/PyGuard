{
  "purpose": "This code defines the public API and imports for the Google Analytics Admin SDK, listing classes, request and response types, and other relevant components for client interaction.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information from an imported package, and imports various classes and types from internal modules such as services, types, and resources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks that process untrusted input, nor does it perform network operations, file access, or command execution.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports and defines exports for SDK components.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is purely declarative, establishing module structure and API surface.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and __all__ definitions for exposing the SDK's classes and types. It imports version info from an internal package, which is standard practice. There are no dynamic code executions, eval statements, or obfuscated segments. All elements are static definitions related to API types and client classes. The structure is consistent with SDK library code, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured SDK interface definition with no malicious intent. It only exposes API classes and types for use by client applications. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
