{
  "purpose": "This code defines protocol buffer message classes for configuring event creation and editing rules in Google Analytics, including conditions and parameter mutations.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reading operations; primarily defines data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output operations that handle untrusted data; no data leaks or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines data models without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual logic present. No obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions using the protobuf library for serializing structured data. No code executes external commands, network operations, or data handling at runtime. The file contains licensing and import statements, and then defines message classes with fields and attributes relevant to event rules in Google Analytics. There are no input/output, system calls, or dynamic code execution. It is purely structural, providing schema for other components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard protobuf schema definition for Google Analytics event rules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this module. It functions as a data structure definition without runtime logic or external interactions.",
