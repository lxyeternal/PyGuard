{
  "purpose": "The code defines protocol buffer message classes for Google Analytics event rules and conditions, enabling structured configuration for event creation and editing rules within the analytics platform.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; the code primarily defines data structures and constants used for configuration.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network communications, or external data handling are present; the code only defines message classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths, as the code consists solely of class definitions and enumerations without runtime logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward data structure definitions with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code contains structured definitions for event rules and matching conditions using protobuf classes, with no runtime execution, input/output handling, or network operations. It adheres to standard protobuf class syntax, and all components are for schema definition. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or security risks. The license and comments are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely schema definitions for Google Analytics event rules, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be legitimate, well-structured code for configuration purposes.",
