  "purpose": "Defines protocol buffer message classes for Google Analytics Admin API v1alpha, including data structures for dimensions, metrics, filters, ordering, report rows, quotas, and related configurations.",
  "sources": "Imports 'proto' module, standard library 'typing', and reads no external or untrusted input; only defines data schemas.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute commands; purely data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this code only declares message classes and attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code is purely declarative schema without executable logic or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of proto message class definitions, following standard conventions for data schemas. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no handling of untrusted input, nor any suspicious patterns are present. It is a schema definition module for Google Analytics API data structures.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard schema declaration for Google Analytics data access and reporting. There are no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
