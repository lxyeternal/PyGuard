{
  "purpose": "The code defines protobuf message classes for Google Analytics API schema, including data structures for filters, metrics, dimensions, report data, and quotas. It serves as data modeling for API communication.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or untrusted input; only protobuf message class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; purely schema declarations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; static class definitions without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of protobuf message class definitions for API data structures. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, or dynamic code. The structure is standard, auto-generated schema code with proper use of protobuf features like oneof fields. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is purely declarative, modeling data for API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard protobuf schema definitions for Google Analytics API. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk are all 0, reflecting its safe and non-malicious nature.",
