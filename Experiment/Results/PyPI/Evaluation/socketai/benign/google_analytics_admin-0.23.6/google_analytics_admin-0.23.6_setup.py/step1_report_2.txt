  "purpose": "Setup script for the google-analytics-admin Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from a specific file, reads README file for long description, and uses setuptools.find_namespace_packages() to discover packages.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or environment variable writes are present.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is from static files (version file, README) into package metadata, which is safe.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the code strictly handles package configuration. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads version information from a specific file, constructs a list of packages, and sets up package metadata using setuptools. All file operations are reading static files; dependencies are hardcoded. No user input or untrusted data sources are processed. No suspicious behaviors or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for package distribution, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
