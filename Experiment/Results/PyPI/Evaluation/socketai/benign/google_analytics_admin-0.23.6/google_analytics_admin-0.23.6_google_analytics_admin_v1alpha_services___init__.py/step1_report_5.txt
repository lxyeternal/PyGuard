  "purpose": "This code appears to be a license and copyright header, likely at the top of a Python source file, intended to specify licensing terms and attribution.",
  "sources": "The header comments do not read input or data; they only contain static text for licensing and copyright information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present, as there is no executable code or data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; this is purely metadata documentation.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or unusual code constructs; it is a standard license header.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard license comment block with no executable statements, no data reading, and no security-relevant operations. It does not contain any obfuscated or malicious content. Since it is only a license header, it cannot perform any harmful actions or leak data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign license header with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical legal notice included at the beginning of source files.",
