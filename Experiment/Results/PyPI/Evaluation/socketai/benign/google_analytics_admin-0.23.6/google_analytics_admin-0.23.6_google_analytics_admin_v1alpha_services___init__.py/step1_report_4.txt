  "purpose": "The code appears to be a license and copyright header, likely for a larger Python source file, serving to specify licensing terms and attribution.",
  "sources": "The code sources are the comments at the beginning of the file, including license information and copyright notices.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in this snippet, as it contains only comments and licensing headers.",
  "flows": "No executable code or data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only licensing comments with no executable or suspicious code segments; no anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The file consists solely of comments specifying licensing and copyright information. No executable code, input reading, data processing, or data transmission is present. Since the entire snippet is static comments, there are no sources, sinks, flows, or suspicious behaviors to analyze. This is standard practice for source files to include licensing headers, and no malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard licensing header with no executable content or suspicious activity. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior concerns.",
