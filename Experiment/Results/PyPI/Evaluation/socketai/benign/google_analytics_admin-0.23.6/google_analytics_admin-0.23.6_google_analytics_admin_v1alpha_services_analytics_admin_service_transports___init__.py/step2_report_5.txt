  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward registration of transport classes into an ordered dictionary, with no data processing, external input handling, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1. The risk score seems slightly high given the benign nature; perhaps 0.1 is acceptable but could be lowered.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no data leaks, no obfuscation.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, standard SDK setup code registering transport classes.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1. Again, the risk score is low but possibly could be 0, as no security concern is evident.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—importing classes, registering them in a registry.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1. The risk score may be slightly overestimated; the code is standard.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard SDK boilerplate.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.0. This seems appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No risk.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1. Again, perhaps slightly high but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's nature—configuration, class registration, no external input, no data processing—the risk scores could reasonably be lower, potentially zero, especially since no security-sensitive operations are involved.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code is standard SDK setup code with no security issues.\n- The current malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate.\n- The risk scores are slightly conservative; they could be lowered to zero, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, standard SDK boilerplate, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scores are slightly conservative but acceptable; I would recommend lowering the risk score to zero for clarity.",
