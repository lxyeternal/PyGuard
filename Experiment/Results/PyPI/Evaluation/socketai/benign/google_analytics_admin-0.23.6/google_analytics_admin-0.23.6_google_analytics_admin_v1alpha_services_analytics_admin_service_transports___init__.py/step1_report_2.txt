{
  "purpose": "Define and register different transport classes for the AnalyticsAdminService API, supporting gRPC, async gRPC, and REST transports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest), and the initialization of the _transport_registry dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data or sensitive operations are performed.",
  "flows": "The code registers transport classes into a registry dictionary, enabling later retrieval and use by the package.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code is standard for SDK transport registration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports transport classes and registers them in an ordered dictionary, providing a registry for transport mechanisms. It includes licensing comments and straightforward class mappings. There are no inputs, external data processing, or actions that could be malicious. The code structure is typical for a client library setup, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK component for registering transport implementations. It contains no malicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, and no security risks. The design is simple and appropriate for its purpose.",
