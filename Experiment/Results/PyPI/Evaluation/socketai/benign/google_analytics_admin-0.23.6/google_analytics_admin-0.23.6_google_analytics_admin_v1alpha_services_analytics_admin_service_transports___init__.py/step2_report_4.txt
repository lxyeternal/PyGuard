  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward module that imports transport classes, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- No user input, external data, or sensitive operations are present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.\n- The purpose is clear: setting up transport class registry for a client SDK.\n- No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate; defines and registers transport classes.\n- **Sources:** Correct; imports from local modules.\n- **Sinks/Flows:** No data flow from untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies:** None; standard code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity, no obfuscation, typical SDK setup.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0 (correct)  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0 (correct)  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0.1 (acceptable for boilerplate code)  \n  - *confidence:* 0.9 (reasonable) given the straightforward nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, reasonable scoring, no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, with slightly higher confidence (1.0).  \n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; standard SDK registration code, no issues.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0.1 (appropriate)  \n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Same observations as above; the reasoning is consistent.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0.1  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Same as above; consistent, standard code, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0.0 (even better, since no risk detected)  \n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Same reasoning; no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0.1 (acceptable for boilerplate code)  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) for each, reflecting minimal inherent risk in boilerplate code, which is reasonable.\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, typical for open-source SDK setup code)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, with no security concerns. The current scoring reflects this accurately.",
