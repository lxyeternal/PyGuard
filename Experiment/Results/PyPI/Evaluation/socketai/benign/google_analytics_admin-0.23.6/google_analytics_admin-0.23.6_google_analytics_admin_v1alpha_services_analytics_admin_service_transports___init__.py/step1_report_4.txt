  "purpose": "Define and register transport classes for an analytics admin service, supporting multiple transport methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules and classes, dictionary assignment for transport registry",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data output observed",
  "flows": "Imports and class references are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns, no unusual dynamic execution or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes and constructs an ordered dictionary to register different transport implementations. It defines module exports. All elements are standard Python patterns for modular design. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code does not handle user input, environment variables, or external data sources. It appears to be a straightforward setup module.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard configuration and registration module for transport classes. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is typical boilerplate code for SDK setup.",
