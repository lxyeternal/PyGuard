{
  "purpose": "Registering transport classes for the Analytics Admin Service SDK, setting up a registry for different transport mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest) that define transport classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; code does not process untrusted input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Imports are assigned to a registry dictionary, which is then exported; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup module that imports transport classes, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and exposes them via __all__. It contains no data processing, external input handling, or security-sensitive operations. The structure is typical for SDK configuration, with standard licensing comments. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (0.1) reflects minimal inherent risk in such boilerplate code, which is reasonable given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK setup code with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are consistent with its benign nature. No modifications are necessary.",
