{
  "purpose": "Defines and registers transport classes for an analytics admin service, including gRPC and REST transports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest). No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code only sets up class mappings and exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely constructs a registry and exports identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated elements, or hidden backdoors detected. Use of OrderedDict and type hints is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports transport classes and creates an ordered dictionary registry mapping string keys to transport classes. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used. The code appears to be a typical setup for a client library module, with standard licensing comments and class registration. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed. The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup module registering transport classes for a client library. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is standard, non-malicious boilerplate code for class registration.",
