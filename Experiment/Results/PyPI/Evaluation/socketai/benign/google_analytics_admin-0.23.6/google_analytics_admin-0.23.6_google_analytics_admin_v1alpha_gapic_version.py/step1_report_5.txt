  "purpose": "Metadata and licensing information for a Python package, including versioning and license details.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains comments and metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input, or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; code consists solely of comments and variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns; standard license header and version info.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical license and metadata header with no executable logic. It only defines a version string and includes licensing comments, which are standard in open-source projects. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. No external inputs or outputs involved. The file appears to serve as a module or package metadata descriptor.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a license and version header with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no executable logic or external data handling.",
