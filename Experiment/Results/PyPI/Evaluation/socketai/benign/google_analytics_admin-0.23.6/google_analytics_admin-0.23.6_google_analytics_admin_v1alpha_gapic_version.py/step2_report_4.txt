  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code snippet is purely a header containing licensing comments and a version variable assignment. There are no executable functions, data processing, network operations, or any suspicious constructs. Therefore, the malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n\n2. **Obfuscation and Anomalies:**  \n   The reports uniformly note that the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or anomalies. This aligns with the code snippet, which is standard boilerplate. The obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n3. **Security Risk and Potential Vulnerabilities:**  \n   Since the code contains only comments and a version string, and no executable logic or data handling, the security risk score of 0 is correct. No vulnerabilities are present in this snippet.\n\n4. **Score Reasonableness and Consistency:**  \n   The scores assigned are consistent and reasonable given the code's nature. All reports assign maximum confidence (1) and zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Any Claims Based on Assumptions?**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n6. **Overall Justification:**  \n   The code snippet is standard boilerplate, serving as a license and version header. It does not pose any security threat or contain malicious behavior.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, non-obfuscated code)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nNo changes are necessary; the scores are accurate. The reports are thorough and consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a typical open-source license header with no security concerns. The scores reflect the code's harmlessness accurately.",
