  "sources": "No data input sources; only static comments and version variables.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of licensing comments and version string, which are standard and benign; no unusual or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only comments, licensing information, and a version variable assignment. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or any executable logic that could be malicious. The license comments and version number are typical for open-source Python files. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard header for a Python source file with license and version information. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior.",
