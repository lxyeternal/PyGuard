  "purpose": "Module exports for AnalyticsAdminService clients (sync and async) for Google Analytics API",
  "sources": "Imports of local modules (.async_client, .client)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output functions present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simply imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and typical for module exports",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines imports from local modules and exports them via __all__. It includes licensing and copyright notices. No dynamic execution, user input, or external data handling observed. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments are present. The code appears to be a standard module definition with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module export file for client classes related to Google Analytics Admin Service. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. No signs of malware or obfuscation. The code's simplicity and lack of external data handling imply very low risk.",
