  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard boilerplate for Python package module exports, with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two client classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use. It contains license information and standard Python package practices. No external inputs, outputs, or suspicious behavior detected. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module file for a Python package, intended to expose client classes for use elsewhere. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
