  "purpose": "Define protocol buffer message classes for Google Analytics subproperty event filters, including filter conditions, expressions, clauses, and the main filter resource.",
  "sources": "Imports external 'proto' library and Python standard libraries; reads protobuf module configuration; uses proto.Message fields for data structure definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or external command executions are present. No code executes based on input data.",
  "flows": "Data flows within message class definitions, with no external data input or output actions. There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code strictly defines data structures for protobuf serialization.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of protobuf message class definitions for filtering logic in Google Analytics. No code execution, data processing, or network interactions are present. It imports a 'proto' library, which is standard for protobuf message definitions, and sets up message fields with appropriate types and oneof constraints. The comments and structure indicate these are data containers for filter logic, with no apparent malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward protobuf message schema for analytics filtering features. It contains no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and normal in the context of defining data schemas.",
