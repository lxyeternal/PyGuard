{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures for Google Analytics subproperty event filters, including filter conditions, expressions, clauses, and the main filter resource.",
  "sources": "Code reads only its own class and attribute definitions; no input or external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no operations that send data over a network, write to files, or execute commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; code is purely declarative with class definitions and no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Use of proto messages is standard for defining structured data models.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python and protobuf libraries to define structured message classes representing filtering logic for Google Analytics. All classes contain attribute definitions with type annotations and are typical for data modeling. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be a straightforward schema definition for filtering rules, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard schema definition for Google Analytics filtering configurations. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The code's purpose is purely structural, facilitating data validation and serialization. No suspicious or malicious signals are detected.",
