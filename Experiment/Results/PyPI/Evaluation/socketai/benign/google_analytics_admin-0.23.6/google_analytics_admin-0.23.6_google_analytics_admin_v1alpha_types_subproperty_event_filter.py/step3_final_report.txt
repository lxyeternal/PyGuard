  "purpose": "Defines protobuf message classes for Google Analytics subproperty event filters, serving as schema definitions for filter configuration.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and attribute declarations within protobuf messages; no runtime input or external data handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, network communication, or external input/output occurs.",
  "flows": "Purely static schema; no data flow or execution paths present.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward protobuf schema with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of protobuf message class definitions used for configuring filters in Google Analytics. It contains no runtime logic, data handling, or external communication. The structure adheres to protobuf conventions, with mutually exclusive 'oneof' fields and clear attribute definitions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the schema-only nature of the code. The high confidence score (1) reflects the thorough assessment and the lack of any suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard protobuf schema for Google Analytics filter configurations. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The assigned scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
