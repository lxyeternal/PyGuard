  "purpose": "Defines protobuf message classes for Google Analytics subproperty event filters, including filter conditions, expressions, and clauses.",
  "sources": "Imports of 'proto' library and standard Python typing modules; protobuf message definitions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input or malicious activity; the code solely defines data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; the code is purely structural protobuf message definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of protobuf message class definitions for filtering logic, including mutually exclusive fields (oneof) and enumerations for filter types. It imports only the 'proto' library and typing modules, with no functions, network calls, or data processing logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks; the code serves as schema definitions for Google Analytics filters.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard protobuf schema for Google Analytics subproperty filters. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or potential attack vectors. Its purpose is purely structural, with no active data processing or network communication. Security and malware risk scores are effectively zero. The confidence score is high, given the absence of suspicious activity or obfuscation.",
