{
  "purpose": "Defines protocol buffer message classes for Google Analytics subproperty event filters, including filter conditions, expressions, clauses, and the main filter resource.",
  "sources": "Imports 'proto' library, type annotations, and standard comments. No input or data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; the code mainly defines data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious patterns, or unusual code behavior observed. Usage of protobuf library for message definitions is standard and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines protocol buffer message classes for filter configurations used in Google Analytics. It contains no executable logic, network operations, file handling, or data processing that could pose security risks. The presence of licensing and import statements are standard. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code does not handle untrusted input directly nor perform any operations that could be exploited. It is a straightforward schema definition.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard schema definition for analytics filters with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe for use.",
