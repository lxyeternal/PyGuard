  "purpose": "Defines Protocol Buffers message classes for Google Analytics subproperty event filters and expressions, facilitating filter configuration and data selection.",
  "sources": "Imports 'proto' library, standard typing modules, and includes licensing and package metadata; no external input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network transmissions, no system modification or sensitive data access functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to internal message class definitions; no runtime data flow or processing logic evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code strictly consists of message class declarations with no suspicious logic, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of protobuf message classes used for filter expressions in Google Analytics. It contains no external input handling, no network or file operations, and no runtime execution logic. It adheres to standard protobuf pattern and licensing comments. The oneof fields are correctly used to enforce mutual exclusivity. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative protobuf message definitions for configuring event filters. It shows no malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no security risks. The likelihood of malware or malicious behavior is extremely low.",
