{
  "purpose": "A comprehensive utility library providing functions for iterable manipulation, combinatorics, mathematical operations, and data processing.",
  "sources": "Internal function calls, parameter inputs, and data passed through iterables and sequences.",
  "sinks": "No external system interactions, network communication, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows are confined within function parameters, internal iterators, and local variables; no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of well-documented, standard utility functions for iterable processing, combinatorics, and math. No external communication, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated or malicious code segments are present. The functions perform safe operations such as iteration, combination, permutation, and mathematical calculations, all of which are typical for utility libraries. The security scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source utility library with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
