  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No, the report indicates an \"Empty response\" with no suspicious code.\n- **Errors, Flaws, Mistakes?** None noted; the report states the code is benign.\n- **Scores?** Malware and security risk scores are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?** Not applicable; all scores are 0.\n- **Overall assessment:** The code is a comprehensive, benign utility library with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No, the report confirms the code is benign.\n- **Errors, Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware and security risk scores are 0, justified.\n- **Justification for higher scores?** Not needed; the report is confident (0.98) in benign nature.\n- **Overall assessment:** No malicious indicators; the code is a standard utility collection.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No, again an \"Empty response.\"\n- **Errors, Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware and security risk scores are 0.\n- **Overall assessment:** The code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No, the report states the response is empty.\n- **Errors, Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware and security risk scores are 0.\n- **Overall assessment:** The code is a benign utility library, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No, the report describes a large, complex utility library.\n- **Errors, Flaws?** None identified; the report confirms benign intent.\n- **Scores?** Malware and security risk scores are 0.\n- **Overall assessment:** The code is a legitimate, open-source utility collection with no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Summary:\n- All reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no suspicious code or behavior.\n- The detailed descriptions confirm the code is a benign, well-structured utility library.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable and justified.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a safe, open-source utility library with no security concerns.",
