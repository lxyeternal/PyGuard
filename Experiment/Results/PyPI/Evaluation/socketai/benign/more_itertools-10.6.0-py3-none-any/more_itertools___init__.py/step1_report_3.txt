{
  "purpose": "This code imports additional iterable utility functions from local modules 'more' and 'recipes' and defines a version string.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.more' and '.recipes'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports with wildcard (*) can potentially import unintended functions, but this is a common pattern in library code and not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a version declaration. It does not process input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The use of 'from ... import *' could be risky in terms of namespace pollution, but it is typical for package modules to aggregate functions this way. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present. The code appears to be part of a package setup or initialization script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup that imports utility functions and sets a version string. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
