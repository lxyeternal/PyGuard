  "purpose": "Module that extends iterable utilities by importing functions from local modules (.more and .recipes) and sets a version string.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.more and .recipes) using relative wildcard imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Import statements load functions/classes into namespace; no data flow or execution flow beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports, which can obscure imported symbols and reduce clarity, but is common in package __init__.py files; no malicious patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer importing all contents from internal modules and defining a version string. No malicious activity, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. Wildcard imports are a maintainability concern but do not constitute security risks. No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed. Multiple reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores (~0.1). The code's simplicity and purpose align with standard package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
