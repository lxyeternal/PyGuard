{
  "purpose": "This module imports additional routines for operating on iterables, extending functionality beyond itertools.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.more' and '.recipes'. These are the only data sources in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; the code does not process untrusted input or write data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs module imports and sets version info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports ('from .more import *') can be risky if the imported modules contain malicious code, but alone it is not evidence of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports all contents from two local modules, likely to enhance iterable operations. No input handling, data processing, or network communication is observed. The version string is set but not used for malicious purposes. The structure and syntax are straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import module, providing additional iterable routines. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based solely on this snippet.",
