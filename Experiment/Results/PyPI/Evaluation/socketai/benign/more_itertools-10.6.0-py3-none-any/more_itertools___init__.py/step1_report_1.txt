{
  "purpose": "This module imports additional iterable utilities and recipes from local submodules, likely to extend Python's itertools capabilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .more and .recipes",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms observed",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; import statements only",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports with wildcard imports could obscure which code is included, but this is not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from two submodules, potentially adding many functions or classes into the namespace. The version string indicates a versioning scheme. No suspicious or malicious code, network activity, or credential handling is evident. The use of wildcard imports may reduce code clarity but does not suggest malicious intent. No obfuscated or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module extension that imports additional utility functions without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
