  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a module that imports everything from two local modules (.more and .recipes) and sets a version string.\n- No evidence of data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- Use of relative imports with wildcard imports, which is common in package __init__.py files but can obscure what functions are imported.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Checks:\n- **Code presence:** The code snippet matches what the reports describe.\n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports mention any signs of malware, suspicious network activity, or code injection. The code is purely import statements and a version string.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code patterns are present.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** The code itself doesn't process data, handle inputs, or perform any actions that could be vulnerable.\n\n---\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- No evidence of malicious code or behavior.  \n**Conclusion:** The malware score should remain **0**.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward import statements.\n- No obfuscation detected.\n**Conclusion:** Obfuscated score should remain **0**.\n\n#### Security Risk / Overall Risk:\n- The reports assign very low security risk scores (0.1 or 0), citing the use of wildcard imports as a minor concern but not malicious.\n- The code is a typical package initialization pattern.\n- No data flows, no external calls, no secrets.\n**Conclusion:** The security risk should be **very low**, ideally **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Checks:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The use of `from .more import *` and `from .recipes import *` is common in package __init__.py files, although it can reduce clarity.\n- No assumptions are made beyond standard package import practices.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1 or 0) are reasonable.\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature, I would suggest:\n  - **Malware score:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0\n  - **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to zero, e.g., 0.05), since no security issues are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n| Metric            | Suggested Score | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior present                       |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                 | Clear, straightforward import statements                     |\n| Security Risk     | 0                 | No data flow, network activity, or vulnerabilities evident |\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate, and I agree with them.",
