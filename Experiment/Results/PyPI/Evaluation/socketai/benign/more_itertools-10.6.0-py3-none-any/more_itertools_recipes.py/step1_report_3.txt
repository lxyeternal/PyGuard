{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for iterable manipulation, mathematical computations, and number theory operations, such as prime testing, polynomial calculations, and data processing.",
  "sources": "Reading data from iterables, sequences, and functions such as input iterators, random functions, and mathematical functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses untrusted input in functions like 'randrange', 'choice', 'sample', and 'pow'; outputs results of prime checks, factorizations, and polynomial evaluations. No direct data leaks or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data flows mainly through random functions and number theoretic calculations, but no evident data exfiltration or malicious command execution pathways are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of cryptographic functions (prime testing, factorization) are standard. No obfuscated code, misleading variables, or unusual behaviors. Functions rely on standard libraries and well-known algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of mathematical, number theory, and iterable utility functions, with proper use of standard Python libraries. No signs of malicious code such as network activity, file system access, or data exfiltration. Random functions used for number generation are typical for mathematical operations. No evidence of sabotage, backdoors, or malware functionalities. The logic is straightforward, and dependencies are from trusted sources. Overall, the code appears benign with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive set of utility functions primarily for mathematical and iterable processing with no indication of malicious or sabotage behavior. It is safe to use from a supply chain security perspective.",
