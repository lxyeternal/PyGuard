{
  "purpose": "A collection of utility functions for iterable processing, mathematical computations, prime testing, factorization, and random sampling, intended for use as helper functions in larger Python projects.",
  "sources": "Functions read input data from iterables, parameters, and internally generated values; no external data sources or network calls.",
  "sinks": "Data flows are internal; no external data leaks, network transmissions, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Input iterables or parameters are processed through functions; randomness functions generate internal values; no external sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected. Use of randomness is standard for utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises well-documented, standard utility functions leveraging Python's itertools, math, and random modules. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. Random functions are used legitimately for sampling, permutations, and probabilistic algorithms. The functions do not perform external communication or system modifications. The overall structure and content are consistent with benign, open-source utility libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, transparent collection of utility functions with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The use of randomness is typical and does not pose a security risk in this context. The supply chain risk is minimal.",
