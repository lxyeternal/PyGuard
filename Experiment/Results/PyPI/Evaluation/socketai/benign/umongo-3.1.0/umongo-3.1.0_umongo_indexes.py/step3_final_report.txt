  "purpose": "Utility functions to parse various index specifications into pymongo IndexModel objects for MongoDB schema definitions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as index strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and IndexModel instances.",
  "sinks": "Creation of IndexModel objects; no external or untrusted data flow or external calls.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through validation and parsing functions into IndexModel objects without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs straightforward validation and conversion without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for handling index specifications. It performs type validation, string prefix parsing, and constructs IndexModel objects accordingly. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. Assertions are used for validation, which is typical. The code is clear, straightforward, and performs its intended purpose without external calls or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility module for MongoDB index configuration. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are detected. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the code's behavior.",
