  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured framework component for managing document templates. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The low security risk score (0.1-0.2) is justified, mainly considering the potential misuse if untrusted templates are registered, but this is a common consideration in such systems. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate."
