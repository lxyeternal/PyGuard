  "purpose": "Define classes and templates for umongo mixin documents, including configuration and implementation details.",
  "sources": "Import statement for modules in the same package; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sink points for untrusted data; no data leaks, external connections, or sensitive operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily defines classes and string representations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for managing umongo mixin documents. It includes documentation, class attributes, and __repr__ methods. No input handling, network operations, or system modifications are present. The code appears to be standard class and attribute definitions with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated elements, or malicious constructs. The only potential concern could be the __repr__ methods, but they do not pose security risks. Overall, the code is straightforward and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of classes related to umongo mixin documents, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe for use.",
