{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes for the umongo library, serving as error indicators for various failure scenarios within the ODM framework.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from UMongoError, with no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present; purely static class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; exception classes are used for error signaling within the application.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward class definitions with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static class definitions for custom exceptions, with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or network operations. The code is standard for error handling infrastructure, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, with high confidence. Minor typo in a docstring does not impact security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for the umongo library. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
