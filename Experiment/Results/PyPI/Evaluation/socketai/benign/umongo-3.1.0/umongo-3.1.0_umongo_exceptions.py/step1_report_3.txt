  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling within the umongo library",
  "sources": "Class definitions and string docstrings within the code",
  "sinks": "No data input, output, or untrusted data handling points are present",
  "flows": "None, as these are static class definitions with no data flow or processing logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns; straightforward class declarations",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base Exception class and including descriptive docstrings. There are no data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution elements. The code is static and intended for error signaling within a library. No signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining custom exception types for error handling and contains no malicious or security-sensitive code. It appears safe and normal for its intended purpose.",
