  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the umongo library to handle various error conditions related to database operations and document management.",
  "sources": "The code defines exception classes; no input data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data flows or causes effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists, as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior are present. The code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception class. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The classes are standard, well-structured, and serve a purpose of error handling within a larger library. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of exception class definitions for error handling in the umongo library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity. It appears safe and standard.",
