  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the umongo library to handle various error scenarios.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception inheritance from built-in Exception class.",
  "sinks": "Exception handling code that may catch or raise these exceptions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no runtime data flow, just class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class declarations inheriting from Exception. There are no input sources, external data reads, or security-sensitive operations. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The classes serve as error indicators within the umongo library and do not perform any malicious actions. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply provides error handling infrastructure for the library.",
