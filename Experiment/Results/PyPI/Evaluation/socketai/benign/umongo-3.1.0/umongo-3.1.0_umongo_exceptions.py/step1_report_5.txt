  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the umongo library, which is used for MongoDB object modeling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception inheritance hierarchy.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sources or input/output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as the code only defines exception classes without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors observed. The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a series of custom exception classes inheriting from a base UMongoError. These are typical for a library to handle specific error cases. There is no code execution, input handling, or external data manipulation. The structure is straightforward and appears to be a standard exception hierarchy, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions intended for error handling within the umongo library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
