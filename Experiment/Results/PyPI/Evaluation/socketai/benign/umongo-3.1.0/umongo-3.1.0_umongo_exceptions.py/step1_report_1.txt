  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the umongo ODM library to handle various error conditions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their docstrings",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or input/output operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely class and exception definitions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; standard exception class definitions with docstrings",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception class. There are no data input, external data sources, or unsafe operations. The classes are straightforward and serve to categorize different error conditions within the library. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present. The use of docstrings for class descriptions is standard practice and does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for a Python library, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
