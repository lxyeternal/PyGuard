  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception class (`UMongoError`).\n   - Each class has a descriptive docstring.\n   - There are no data handling, external input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is static and solely for error categorization within the library.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The code appears to be straightforward, standard practice for defining custom exceptions.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is only defining exception classes, with no data flow or external interactions.\n   - No report suggests any suspicious activity or potential vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Malware**: All reports assign 0 or 0.0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - **Security Risk**: All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n   - **Confidence**: All are at 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Justification**:\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions for exceptions, there is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n   - The consistent scoring across reports aligns with the content.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - No hidden or obfuscated code, no dynamic behavior.\n   - The exception classes serve as infrastructure for error handling, not execution or data manipulation.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the content.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions for the `umongo` library. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThese reflect the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
