{
  "purpose": "This code provides localization support through gettext functions, allowing messages to be translated based on locale settings.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the function parameter 'message' in 'gettext' and 'N_', and potentially from a user-defined function passed to 'set_gettext'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs localized messages and modifies the global '_gettext' function; no external data sinks are directly present.",
  "flows": "Input from 'message' flows into 'gettext' and 'N_' functions; 'set_gettext' can alter '_gettext', affecting future 'gettext' calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple functions for localization purposes. The '_gettext' variable can be set to a custom function via 'set_gettext', allowing dynamic behavior. This is standard practice in localization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The functions are straightforward, with no complex or suspicious constructs. The 'set_gettext' function's ability to replace '_gettext' could be misused if a malicious function is supplied, but in this context, it is a normal feature for localization customization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of localization helpers, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain malware or suspicious behaviors and is safe to use within its intended purpose.",
