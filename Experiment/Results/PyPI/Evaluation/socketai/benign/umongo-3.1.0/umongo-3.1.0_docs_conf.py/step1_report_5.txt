  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building documentation using Sphinx for the 'uMongo' project.",
  "sources": "Import of 'umongo' module, reading current working directory, sys.path modifications, and reading version info from 'umongo'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sinks such as network, file writes, or eval calls.",
  "flows": "Import 'umongo' after inserting project root into sys.path, reading version info from 'umongo'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of sys.path modification is typical for documentation builds.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file for building project documentation. It modifies sys.path to include the project root, imports the 'umongo' module to access version info, and sets up various documentation parameters and themes. All code appears consistent with common documentation setup practices. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected, nor are there any obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. No network operations, data leaks, or code injection points are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Sphinx documentation configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. It properly imports the project module to access version info, which is a common pattern. No signs of supply chain attacks or malicious behavior are evident.",
