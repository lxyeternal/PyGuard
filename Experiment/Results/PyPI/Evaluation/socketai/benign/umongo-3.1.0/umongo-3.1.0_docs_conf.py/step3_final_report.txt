  "purpose": "Configuration for Sphinx documentation build, setting up sys.path and importing 'umongo' solely for version info.",
  "sources": "Reading project root directory, importing 'umongo' for version info",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network operations",
  "flows": "Import of 'umongo' during initialization",
  "anomalies": "Importing 'umongo' could execute code if the package has side effects, but static analysis cannot confirm runtime behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script. It modifies sys.path to include the project root and imports 'umongo' only to access its version attribute. There are no network calls, data leaks, or obfuscated patterns. The import of 'umongo' could, in theory, execute code if the package is malicious, but static analysis cannot determine this. The code is straightforward and benign in static form.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard documentation configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. The import of 'umongo' is typical for version retrieval and does not indicate malicious behavior. The scores should reflect minimal risk and no obfuscation.",
