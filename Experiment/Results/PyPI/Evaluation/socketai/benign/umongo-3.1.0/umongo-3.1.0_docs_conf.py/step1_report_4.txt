  "purpose": "Configuration for building uMongo project documentation using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Reads system path, current working directory, and imports 'umongo' module.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data outputs or network connections.",
  "flows": "Imports 'umongo' after modifying sys.path; no other source-to-sink flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. The code mainly sets up documentation build configuration with standard libraries and no embedded secrets or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manipulates sys.path to include the project root, then imports a module 'umongo' to retrieve version info for documentation purposes. All operations involve standard library functions and well-known packages. No input/output handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code structure is typical of Sphinx configuration files and contains no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Sphinx configuration script for project documentation. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements. The overall security risk is minimal, with no signs of malware or security threats.",
