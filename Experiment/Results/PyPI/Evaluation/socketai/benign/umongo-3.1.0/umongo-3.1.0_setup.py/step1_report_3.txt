{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'umongo', used to specify package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files, and importing 'setuptools' or 'distutils' modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or system command executions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; file reads are static and intended for package setup metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code appears straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import 'setuptools' and falls back to 'distutils.core' if unavailable. It reads local files 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' for long descriptions, and defines package requirements. The 'setup' function specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers, all of which are standard for Python package distribution. No untrusted input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, network communications, or obfuscated code. The overall security risk is minimal.",
