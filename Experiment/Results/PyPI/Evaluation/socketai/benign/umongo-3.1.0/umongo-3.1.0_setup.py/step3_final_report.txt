{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures a Python package named 'umongo', specifying dependencies, reading description files, and calling setup() with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files in binary mode, decoding as UTF-8.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static file reads and static metadata assignment.",
  "flows": "File reads in main script flow; no dynamic or external data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script. It reads local files for descriptions, defines dependencies explicitly, and calls setup() with static metadata. There are no network calls, code injections, or dynamic behaviors. The code structure is straightforward, and the dependencies are specified with version constraints. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minimal supply chain risk associated with external dependencies and file reads is acknowledged but does not constitute a security concern. Overall, the code is safe and the assessments are accurate.",
