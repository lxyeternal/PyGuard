  "purpose": "Defines setup configuration for the 'umongo' Python package, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files for long description; imports setup functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code executes based on external input or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads files for description data; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. The code appears standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions, reads description files, and specifies package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent. It securely manages package metadata and dependencies without executing untrusted code or performing harmful actions.",
