{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for AWS Cloud9 service, facilitating type-checked SDK usage.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; properties; constants.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; code mainly defines interfaces and type annotations without executing untrusted data or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly type annotations and method signatures without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic present. The code is primarily declarative with standard SDK interface definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, class definitions, method signatures, and documentation links. It includes conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility and defines a class for Cloud9 client interactions, including exceptions and paginator methods. No suspicious code, network operations, or runtime data handling indicative of malicious intent is observed. The purpose appears to be providing a type-safe SDK interface for AWS Cloud9. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard SDK interface with type annotations for AWS Cloud9, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a declarative wrapper for the AWS SDK, focusing on type safety and documentation.",
