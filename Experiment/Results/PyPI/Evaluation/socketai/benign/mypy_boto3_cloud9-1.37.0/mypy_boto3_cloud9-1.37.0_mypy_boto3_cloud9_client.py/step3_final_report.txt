  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS Cloud9 SDK client, serving as static type hints for development and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class and method signatures, documentation links, conditional imports for compatibility, and type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Method calls, property accesses, URL generation, and exception handling within the SDK interface.",
  "flows": "Method parameters unpacked into request types, property accesses, and URL generation; no runtime data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious code, or unusual data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, declarative SDK interface comprising class definitions, method signatures, and type annotations. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or network operations. Conditional imports ensure compatibility across Python versions. All signals point to a well-structured, standard SDK stub designed for static analysis and IDE support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious, static interface for the AWS Cloud9 client, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with its purpose as a type stub.",
