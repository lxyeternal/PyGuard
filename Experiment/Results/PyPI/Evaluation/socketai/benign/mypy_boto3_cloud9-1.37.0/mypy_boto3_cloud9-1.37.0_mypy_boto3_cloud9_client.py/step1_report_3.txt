{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the AWS Cloud9 service, providing methods for managing Cloud9 environments and related resources.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type definitions, imports modules and classes, and accesses sys.version_info for conditional imports. No external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send data to external systems or network endpoints; it only defines class structures and method signatures.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is primarily a structured interface with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive type annotations, conditional imports based on Python version, and documentation strings. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The module is a static type stub and interface layer for AWS Cloud9 SDK. It defines method signatures, exception classes, and type aliases. No runtime code, data handling, or external network operations are present. The use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard for compatibility. The code appears to be a well-structured, non-malicious SDK interface file.",
  "conclusion": "There are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code is a standard, type-annotated SDK interface for AWS Cloud9, serving as a static code foundation without executable logic or data handling. The malware score is low, and no security risks are evident.",
