  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, static setup script for a Python package.\n- No untrusted inputs, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code reads a local README.md file for description, which is a common and safe practice.\n- The dependency specification is explicit and static.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of the code's safety:\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, dynamic behavior, or malicious code.\n- All reports' assessments that the code is benign and typical for a setup script are accurate.\n\n### Issues with reported scores:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The confidence score is 1.0, which is appropriate given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n### Potential points of concern:\n- The only minor point is the dependency specification `'typing-extensions; python_version<\"3.12\"'`. While this is standard conditional dependency syntax, it is important to verify that no malicious code could be embedded in such dependency declarations. However, in this case, it's a common pattern and safe.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary and recommendations:**\n\n- The reports are accurate; the code is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- The detailed reasoning confirms that this is a typical, safe setup script with no supply chain risks.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
