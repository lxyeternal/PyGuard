{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used to package and distribute the 'mypy-boto3-cloud9' Python library, providing metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for the long description, and static package metadata defined within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; all inputs and data sources are either static or from the local filesystem.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the README.md file into the long_description variable, then into the setup() function to configure packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The script strictly follows standard Python packaging practices with no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path from pathlib and setuptools for packaging. It reads a local README.md file for description content. The setup() call provides package metadata, dependencies, URLs, classifiers, and package data. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. No potential code injection, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected. The script is straightforward, conventional, and contains no suspicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It reads static files and defines package metadata safely. Overall, it appears secure and legitimate.",
