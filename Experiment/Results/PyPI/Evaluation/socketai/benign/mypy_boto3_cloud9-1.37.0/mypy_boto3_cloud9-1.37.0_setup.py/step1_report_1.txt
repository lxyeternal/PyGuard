{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-cloud9 package, used for distribution and installation",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setup from setuptools; static metadata definitions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static values are used for package configuration",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; static metadata assigned to setup parameters",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; straightforward setup script",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup with static metadata, dependencies, and package data. It reads the README.md file for long description, which is a common and safe practice. The import of 'setup' from setuptools is standard, and there are no inputs from external sources or environment variables that could be exploited. No dynamic code execution, network access, or credential handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It securely defines package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious elements.",
