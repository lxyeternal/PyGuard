  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, static setup script for packaging a Python module.\n- No untrusted inputs, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code reads a local README.md file for long description, which is a common practice.\n- The package metadata, dependencies, and URLs are static and publicly available.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the descriptions: it's a straightforward setup script.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence score of 1.0 aligns with the clarity and standard nature of the code.\n\n### Potential issues or points of critique:\n- The only minor note is that the `install_requires` includes a conditional dependency on `typing-extensions` for Python versions less than 3.12, which is a standard practice and not malicious.\n- No dynamic or external data is used, so no attack surface exists.\n\n### Justification of scores:\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score (0):** No security risks or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Final assessment:\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and consensus among the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe setup script is a typical, well-structured, and secure Python package configuration. No malicious or suspicious elements are present, and the assigned scores reflect this accurately.",
