{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package, defining metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static metadata fields; explicit dependency list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external inputs or network activity; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static data used for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script using setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or untrusted inputs. Reading README.md is a common, safe practice. Dependencies are explicitly specified with conditional requirements, which are standard. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a typical, safe, and benign configuration file with no malicious or suspicious elements. The code poses no security risks, and the current assessment scores are appropriate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
