  "analysis": "The code contains only a comment indicating the source of truth for the version, a copyright statement, and a simple variable assignment (__version__ = '1.37.0'). There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. The code is minimal and typical for version declaration in Python packages.",
