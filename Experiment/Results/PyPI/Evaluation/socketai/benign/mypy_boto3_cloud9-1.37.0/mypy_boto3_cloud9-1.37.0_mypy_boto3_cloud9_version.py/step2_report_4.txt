  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, as well as assess the scores.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe a minimal, straightforward version declaration: a comment, a copyright statement, and an assignment to `__version__`.\n- No input/output, data flows, or external interactions are present.\n- The code appears standard and benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- The only unusual aspect is the copyright year (2025), which is in the future relative to current dates, but this is not inherently suspicious or malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n\n**Are the reported issues present?**  \nYes. All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple version string assignment with no suspicious behavior.\n\n**Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \nNo. All reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately describe the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Score Analysis:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports give 0.0, which is appropriate since the code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Malware score:** All reports give 0.0, which is correct given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports give 0.0, which is justified because the code does not perform any risky operations or data handling.\n\n**Potential concern:** The future year (2025) in the copyright comment is noted as unusual, but it doesn't impact security or indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed based on the code content.\n- The reports correctly dismiss any malicious or obfuscated concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0.0 (code is clear and straightforward)  \n**Estimated security risk score:** 0.0 (no security concerns)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious features. The only minor anomaly is the future year in the copyright statement, which does not affect security.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
