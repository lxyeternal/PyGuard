  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package, serving as a source of truth for the package version information.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string \"1.37.0\" to the variable __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output sinks are present.",
  "flows": "None; simple assignment statement with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright statement with a future year (2025) but no other suspicious or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a copyright comment, a version variable assignment, and a copyright statement. The version string is hardcoded, which is common in package versioning. There are no signs of obfuscated code, data leaks, or malicious logic. The code is straightforward and typical for a version source file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of the future year in the copyright statement is unusual but not malicious or suspicious in the context of code security.",
