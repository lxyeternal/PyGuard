  "purpose": "Define the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string \"1.37.0\" to the variable __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is a static assignment with no external data input or output.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the future year (2025) in the copyright comment, which is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static declaration of the package version with a comment. No inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. The only minor anomaly is the future year in the comment, which does not impact security. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version declaration file with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
