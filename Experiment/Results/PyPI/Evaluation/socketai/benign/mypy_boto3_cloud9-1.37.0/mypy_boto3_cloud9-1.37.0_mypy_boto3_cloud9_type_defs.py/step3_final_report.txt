  "purpose": "Static type definitions for AWS Cloud9 SDK, facilitating type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal literals module, built-in modules, and type annotations within class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains only static type definitions with no runtime data handling or external input.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or execution occurs in this static code.",
  "anomalies": "None; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining TypedDict classes for AWS Cloud9 API structures, with conditional imports for compatibility. No executable logic, network calls, or data processing are present. The imported literals are external to this code and assumed benign. The structure is standard for type annotations, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static set of type definitions for AWS Cloud9 SDK, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate benign, well-structured code intended solely for static type checking.",
