  "purpose": "Type definitions for the cloud9 service API, used for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type annotations, and data structure definitions.",
  "sinks": "None observed; the code primarily defines data structures and types without runtime input or data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; this code does not process runtime data or execute logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious patterns detected. Usage of conditional imports based on Python version is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely for type annotations and data structure definitions using TypedDict and conditional imports for compatibility. It does not include any runtime data handling, external input processing, network operations, or code execution. All imported modules and defined types are standard, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs. The presence of detailed type annotations and documentation indicates its role as a type stubs module. No signals of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard, and intended solely for static type definitions. No malicious or security-threatening behavior detected.",
