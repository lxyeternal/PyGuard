  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report to identify any inconsistencies, logical flaws, or overlooked issues.\n\n**Overall Assessment of the Code:**\n\n- The code is a static set of type definitions for the AWS Cloud9 SDK, primarily using TypedDict and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- There are no runtime operations, data processing, network calls, or external input handling.\n- The code does not contain any executable logic, dynamic code, or obfuscated constructs.\n- Import statements are standard, referencing internal literals and built-in modules.\n- The purpose is to facilitate static type checking and documentation.\n\n**Malware and Security Risk Evaluation:**\n\n- No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or hidden payloads.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- No external data handling or network operations.\n- The code is purely declarative, defining data structures.\n\n**Analysis of the Reports:**\n\n- All five reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, with a confidence level of 1 and a malware score of 0.\n- They correctly identify that the code is for static type annotations and does not perform any malicious or risky operations.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or vulnerabilities are detected.\n\n**Potential Issues or Points of Concern:**\n\n- Since the code is purely type definitions, the primary concern would be whether any imported literals or constants could be malicious or contain hidden payloads. However, these are imported from an internal module (`.literals`), which is not shown here. Given the context, these are likely standard constants.\n- The use of conditional imports for compatibility is standard practice and not suspicious.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The code appears safe and standard for a type definitions module.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No.\n- **Errors or flaws in logic:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely static type annotations with no runtime or malicious behavior.\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with all the reports' assessments.",
