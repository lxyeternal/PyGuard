  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a set of static type definitions for the AWS Cloud9 SDK, using TypedDict and conditional imports for compatibility.\n- No executable logic, data processing, network calls, or untrusted data handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident.\n- The code serves as a schema for type checking and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Confirms the code is for static type annotations, no runtime logic.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct, reasonable.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, emphasizes only type definitions.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no dynamic code.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct, reasonable.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Reiterates the absence of runtime logic, external data handling.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no malicious patterns.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct, reasonable.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Focuses on the code being purely static type definitions.\n- **Findings:** No executable code, no data leaks, no suspicious constructs.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct, reasonable.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same conclusion, code is safe and only for static typing.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct, reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. **Set at 0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree. **Set at 0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of runtime logic, external data handling, or security vulnerabilities, **risk should be 0**.\n\n### Additional Justification:\n- The code is purely static type definitions, with no executable code, network calls, or data processing.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- The use of conditional imports for compatibility is standard practice.\n- The code's purpose is documentation and type checking, not runtime behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of all reports. The code is benign and serves as a static type annotation module for AWS Cloud9 SDK.\n\n**Summary:**  \n**All scores are appropriate. The code is safe, well-structured, and free of security threats.**",
