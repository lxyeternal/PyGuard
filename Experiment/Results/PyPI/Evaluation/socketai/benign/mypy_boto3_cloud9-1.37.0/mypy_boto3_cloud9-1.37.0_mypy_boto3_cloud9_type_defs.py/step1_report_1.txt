  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the AWS Cloud9 service SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, datetime, and internal literals; data definitions including environment configurations, request and response types.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external output, such as network connections or file operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines data structures, with no runtime logic or data flow operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; standard usage of TypedDict and conditional imports based on Python version; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type definitions for a Python SDK for AWS Cloud9, including request/response data structures and environment configurations. It uses conditional imports to maintain compatibility across Python versions, which is standard. The absence of executable logic, network calls, or data processing indicates this is a static type annotation module. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or code that could perform unauthorized actions. The code serves as a library for defining data schemas and does not include runtime vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS Cloud9 SDK. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is purely for static type hinting and data structure validation, with no signs of malware or security threats.",
