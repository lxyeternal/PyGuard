  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Cloud9 service interactions, used for type safety and validation.",
  "sources": "Constant imports from .literals module, sys.version_info checks, and various type definitions that describe data structures and API request/response formats.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data leading to security issues. No data is processed or transmitted; only data structures and type annotations are defined.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since this code only defines types and constants, with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code strictly defines data types and imports without executing any logic or handling untrusted input.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants and performs conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard. It defines several TypedDict classes for AWS Cloud9 API request and response structures, using type hints and optional fields. There are no data processing, no runtime input handling, no network operations, or any suspicious dynamic execution. All elements serve to provide static type checking support for other code modules. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for static type definitions and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data, execute code, or perform any network or system operations. The code appears safe and standard for type annotation purposes.",
