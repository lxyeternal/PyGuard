  "purpose": "Type annotations for cloud9 service type definitions, enabling static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of data structures, type aliases, and import statements.",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains only type definitions and import statements with no data processing or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; the code only defines types without runtime data or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively consists of type definitions using TypedDict for structured data, conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility, and documentation comments. There are no functions, data processing, or external data interactions. Import statements are standard, and the type definitions are straightforward, aligning with typical SDK style for type annotations. No evidence of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of type annotations for the cloud9 service, intended to facilitate static type checking and documentation. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks within this code snippet.",
