{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structures for the cloud9 service API, used for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Code imports (sys, datetime, literals, builtins/typing_extensions), type definitions, and static data assignments.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution functions that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., environment IDs, ARNs, user input via function parameters) through data structures but no untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely type definitions with no executable logic, no dynamic code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious constructs. Usage of sys.version_info for compatibility is standard. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no code injection vectors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of TypedDict classes and constants for static type checking, documenting data shapes and expected values for the cloud9 service. All type definitions are straightforward, with no executable code, no dynamic data handling, and no network or file operations. Import statements are standard, with conditional imports for compatibility. No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type definition module for a Python AWS SDK-like library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and intended for static type validation purposes only.",
