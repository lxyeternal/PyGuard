  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report Summaries & Analysis:**\n\n- All five reports describe the script as a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on a command-line argument ('--version').  \n- The code uses only standard modules (`sys`) and performs simple conditional checks.  \n- No external data sources, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present.  \n- No secrets, credentials, or sensitive data are involved.  \n- The logic is clear, simple, and consistent with typical CLI info scripts.  \n- All reports confidently conclude the script is benign, with a malware score of 0 and no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code:** None. The code matches the description, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None. The code is minimal and straightforward.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware: 0 across all reports — justified, as no malicious activity is detected.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation is present.\n  - Security risk: 0 or very close to it — the script is benign.\n  - Confidence: 1.0 — high, given the consistent findings.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.  \n- The code does not perform any suspicious operations or contain any hidden behaviors.  \n- The static strings and simple flow are typical for CLI utilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- Confirmed as 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- Confirmed as 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- All reports assign 0 or very close to 0. Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, a risk score of **0.0** is justified.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; the code is straightforward.  \n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Estimated Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware            | 0.0                   |\n| Obfuscated         | 0.0                   |\n| Security Risk      | 0.0                   |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard CLI utility that outputs static package info and version details. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo further action needed. The current scores are appropriate and justified based on the code analysis.",
