  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides informational output about boto3 Cloud9 stubs.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (for command-line arguments), sys.stdout (for printing info), static strings (for info messages)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (for output), sys.argv (for input via command-line arguments)",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version output; otherwise, print_info is called, both writing to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script simply checks for a '--version' argument and prints version info or package info accordingly. It does not perform any network activity, handle sensitive data, or execute dynamic code. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious payloads. No obfuscation or unusual constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI utility that outputs package information. There are no indicators of malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation in this code.",
