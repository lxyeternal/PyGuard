  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that outputs package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout (outputs package info and version)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (writes output), sys.argv (reads command-line input)",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, the program calls print_version() which writes version info to stdout; otherwise, it calls print_info() which writes package details to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, and no dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that responds to a '--version' argument by printing version info, otherwise prints static package info. All data output is hardcoded and static. There are no external data inputs beyond command-line args, and outputs are directly to stdout. No potential data leaks, no external network calls, and no obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static CLI utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It only outputs predefined package information based on user input. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
