  "purpose": "CLI entrypoint for a Python package providing version and package information",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout.write for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data to stdout, no other sinks detected",
  "flows": "User input from sys.argv influences whether print_version() or print_info() is called; data flows to stdout via sys.stdout.write",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded version strings and URLs are typical for CLI info scripts; no secrets or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The script provides package info and version details based on command-line argument '--version'. It reads input from sys.argv and outputs to stdout. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code is straightforward, with no external data sources or dangerous operations. It does not perform any network activity, file modifications, or hidden processes. The static strings and flow are normal for a CLI utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package information and version details. There are no indications of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks.",
