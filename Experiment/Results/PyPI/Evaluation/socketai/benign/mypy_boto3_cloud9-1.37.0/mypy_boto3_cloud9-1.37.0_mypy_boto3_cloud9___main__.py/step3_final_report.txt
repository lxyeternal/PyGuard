{
  "purpose": "Provide a concise security assessment of the provided Python CLI script, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments (`sys.argv`), writing static strings to `sys.stdout`",
  "sinks": "Outputting static package info or version; no untrusted data handling or external data sources",
  "flows": "Command-line input (if '--version') leads to printing version; otherwise, printing package info",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with static strings and simple control flow",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package information or version based on command-line input. It uses only standard modules (`sys`) and performs simple conditional checks. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The strings are hardcoded, and there are no secrets or sensitive data involved. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero. The code's simplicity and static output indicate no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
