{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point that provides package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 Cloud9.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output, and imported sys module.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write() functions where data is printed to stdout.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument parsing from sys.argv to determine whether to print version or info, then output to stdout via sys.stdout.write().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected. The code is straightforward and standard for a CLI utility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports only the sys module, which is standard for CLI scripts. It defines functions to print package info and version, triggered by command-line argument '--version'. The output strings are static and hardcoded. There are no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The script performs simple print operations with no signs of malicious behavior. The code structure is clean and typical for a CLI utility, with no anomalies indicating sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying package information and version, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It contains no suspicious behaviors or obfuscated code, and the overall security risk score is minimal.",
