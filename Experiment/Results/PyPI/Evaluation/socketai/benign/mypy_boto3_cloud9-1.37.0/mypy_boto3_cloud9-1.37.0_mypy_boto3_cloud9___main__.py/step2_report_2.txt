  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description—simple CLI utility printing static info.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None detected; logic straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, static strings, no external data, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no security concern.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Code presence:** Same as above; static CLI info script.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious code, no dynamic execution, no secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign utility.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Code presence:** Same pattern, static info display.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Code presence:** Same as others.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.1 — slightly higher but still minimal.\n- **Justification:** The small security risk score (0.1) may reflect the fact that the script outputs static info, which in itself is benign but could be slightly risky if misused (e.g., if an attacker manipulates the CLI environment). However, no actual malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Still benign, but the small risk score is acceptable given the static nature.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Code presence:** Same straightforward CLI info script.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports are 0.0, which aligns with the code's benign static nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0.0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0.0, with one report at 0.1, which is reasonable given the static info output.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n- The code is extremely simple and static, with no dynamic or suspicious behavior. The small security risk score of 0.1 in one report might be slightly overcautious but still acceptable given the static output.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware:** Should remain at 0.0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Keep at 0.0 for all, or at most 0.1 for the one report, but since the code is benign, 0.0 is preferable.\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a benign CLI utility that outputs static package info and version. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned are appropriate, though a risk score of 0.0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's straightforward nature.",
