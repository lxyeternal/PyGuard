  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides informational output about boto3 Cloud9 SDK stub details and version.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments; sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for outputting package info and version",
  "flows": "User provides command-line arguments; if '--version' is present, it calls print_version(), otherwise calls print_info().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No external data fetching or execution of untrusted code.",
  "analysis": "The script simply checks for a '--version' argument to decide which informational message to display. It uses standard Python sys module functions for output. No user input processing beyond argument check, no network activity, no code execution, no data leakage, and no use of environment variables or untrusted inputs. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors. The logic is simple and consistent with a CLI info script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI utility that outputs package information and version details. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this code segment.",
