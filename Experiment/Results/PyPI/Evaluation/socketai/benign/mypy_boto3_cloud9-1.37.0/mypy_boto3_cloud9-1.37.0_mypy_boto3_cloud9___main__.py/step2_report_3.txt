  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility.\n- It responds to `--version` by printing a static version string.\n- Otherwise, it prints static package info.\n- All strings are hardcoded.\n- No external data, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code is straightforward, static, and does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0 or very close to 0. This aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Malware Score:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity—no code injection, backdoors, or network activity.\n- All reports agree on malware score = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score should remain **0**.\n\n#### **Obfuscated Score:**\n- The code is clear, straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- All reports assign 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated score should be **0**.\n\n#### **Risk Score:**\n- Given the static nature and lack of malicious behavior, the overall security risk is minimal.\n- Some reports assign a very low risk (0.1), possibly due to the minimal potential for future misuse, but given the code as-is, the risk remains negligible.\n- **Conclusion:** Risk score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard CLI utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- All strings are static, and no external data or dynamic execution occurs.\n- No obfuscation or hidden code is present.\n- The code's purpose is purely informational, with no security concerns.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent with the code's benign nature. No changes are necessary. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis.",
