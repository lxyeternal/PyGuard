  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on a command-line argument (`--version`).\n- It imports only the `sys` module.\n- It performs straightforward checks and outputs, with no external data fetching, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports confirm the code is a benign CLI utility with static strings, no obfuscation, no external data sources, and no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0 or very close to 0. These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  No. All are well below 0.5, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Confirmed as 0 across all reports. No malicious activity is detected or suggested.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All analyses are based on straightforward static code review, with no assumptions about hidden behavior.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report?**  \n  Yes. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a standard CLI info script.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n- Static strings and simple logic make it very low risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
