{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the Cloud9 service client in boto3, providing type hints and structure for paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "import statements, class definitions, method definitions, type annotations, conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No untrusted data sources, network operations, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code primarily consists of type definitions and class structures, not runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code logic detected. The code is primarily boilerplate for type annotations and class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines paginator classes with type annotations, and conditionally imports Unpack for Python >= 3.12. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data manipulation is present. The classes extend boto3 paginator classes and specify method signatures with type hints. The purpose is to facilitate type checking and IDE support. No suspicious or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, standard boilerplate for boto3 paginator type annotations, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations. It is safe and intended for type hinting purposes.",
