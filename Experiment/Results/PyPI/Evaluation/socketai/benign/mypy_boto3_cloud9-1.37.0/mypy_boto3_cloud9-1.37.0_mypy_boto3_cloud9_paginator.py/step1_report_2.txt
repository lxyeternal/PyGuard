  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the AWS Cloud9 service client, used for paginating API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class method parameters receiving **kwargs.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of **kwargs in paginate methods, which could process untrusted input if misused, but in context it is for API parameters.",
  "flows": "paginate methods receive untrusted data via **kwargs and pass it directly to the PageIterator, but this is standard for boto3 paginators; no malicious flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The code appears straightforward and documentation-focused.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type annotations and paginator classes for AWS Cloud9 service, with conditional imports for compatibility, and simple subclassing of boto3's Paginator. The methods use **kwargs with type unpacking, typical for boto3 paginators, and include links to documentation. No suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-documented type annotations and class structure for AWS SDK paginators. No malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risk identified. It appears to be a legitimate part of a type stub package.",
