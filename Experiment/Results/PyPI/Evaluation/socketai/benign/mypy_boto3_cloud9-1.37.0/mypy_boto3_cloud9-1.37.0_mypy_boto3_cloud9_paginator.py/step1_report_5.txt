{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for AWS Cloud9 service client, facilitating pagination of API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; class methods receiving **kwargs for pagination.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data; methods do not process untrusted input directly, only define interfaces.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks that could indicate malicious data handling; class methods primarily define type hints.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hidden dynamic execution. Code is straightforward type annotation and class extension.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes with type annotations, extending from botocore's Paginator, with conditional imports based on Python version. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic present. It strictly provides type hints and documentation links for clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module focusing on type annotations for AWS Cloud9 paginator classes. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a legitimate, well-structured type definition module.",
