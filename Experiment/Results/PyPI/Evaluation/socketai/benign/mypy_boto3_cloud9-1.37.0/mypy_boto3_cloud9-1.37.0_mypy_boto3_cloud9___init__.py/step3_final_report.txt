{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a Python SDK interface module for the cloud9 service, importing classes from local modules and exposing them for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports from local modules (.client and .paginator).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up class aliases and exports them.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year 2025, which is likely a placeholder or typo but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes from local modules, assigns an alias, and exports them. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of sensitive data. The documentation and usage examples are static. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The future date in the copyright notice is noted but does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0 with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SDK interface module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
