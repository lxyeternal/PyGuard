  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to assess the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- **Code Purpose & Nature:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a static set of type alias definitions using Python's `Literal`. The code's primary role is to facilitate type safety and developer tooling support for AWS resource string constants.\n\n- **Behavior & Data Flow:** No dynamic code, input/output handling, network communication, or data processing is present. The code is purely declarative.\n\n- **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs are evident. The only notable point is the use of a Python version check for importing `Literal`, which is standard practice.\n\n- **Security Risks:** Given the static nature, no security risks or vulnerabilities are apparent.\n\n- **Unusual Details:** The copyright year is set to 2025, which is in the future relative to current dates, but this is not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the purpose as defining type annotations for AWS Cloud9 literals.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no external data handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, consistent, and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing type safety.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, purely static.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general purpose.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No issues; static declarations only.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no external data processing.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious activity. The mention of the future copyright year is noted but not security relevant.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence & Issues:** The code matches the description; it is a static set of type aliases with no runtime or dynamic behavior. No issues are present.\n- **Malware & Security Risks:** All reports correctly assign malware and security risk scores as 0.\n- **Obfuscation & Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious anomalies are detected.\n- **Score Consistency:** All scores are consistent with the code's nature and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, static type definition module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, consistent, and appropriately assess the code as safe. No modifications to scores are necessary.",
