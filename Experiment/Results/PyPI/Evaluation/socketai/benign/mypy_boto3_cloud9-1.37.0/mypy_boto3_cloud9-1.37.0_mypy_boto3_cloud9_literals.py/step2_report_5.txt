  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a static set of type alias definitions using `Literal` for AWS resource names, environment statuses, actions, regions, etc.\n- It uses a conditional import pattern to support Python versions before and after 3.12.\n- There are no runtime operations, data processing, or external data handling.\n- The code does not include any network activity, secrets, or obfuscated segments.\n- The only notable point is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future, but this is not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. All reports agree that the code is purely declarative, static, and safe.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **No flaws detected:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a set of type annotations for AWS resource literals, with no malicious intent or logic flaws.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate. No malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0.0; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is justified given the static, safe nature of the code.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The future copyright year \"2025\" is unusual but not malicious.\n- The large list of literals is extensive but static, serving as type safety aids.\n- The conditional import pattern is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on all reports and analysis:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (correct)\n\n**Additional comments:**\n\n- The code is a well-structured, static type declaration module.\n- No signs of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n- The purpose is solely to improve type safety and developer experience.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n**The code is safe, non-malicious, and serves a static purpose.**  \nNo changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the observed static, safe nature of the code.",
