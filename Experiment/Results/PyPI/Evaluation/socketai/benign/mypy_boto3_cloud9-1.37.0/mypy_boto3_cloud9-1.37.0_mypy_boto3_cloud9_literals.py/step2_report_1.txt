  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to assess the security implications, consistency, and accuracy of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is purely a static collection of string literal type aliases for AWS resource names, statuses, and regions.\n- There is no runtime logic, data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution.\n- The import pattern with conditional 'Literal' import is standard for compatibility.\n- The large list of literals is comprehensive but static, serving for type safety and validation.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated/malicious code are present.\n- The only unusual aspect is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future, but this is a content detail, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly identifies the code as defining type annotations for AWS Cloud9 literals.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no external data sinks, no dynamic logic. The comprehensive list of literals is static data.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 1.\n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code's nature. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; the code defines type annotations with static string literals.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No dynamic behavior, no external interactions, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct; similar to above.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; purely static type annotations.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; highlights the 'sys.version_info' check and static literals.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No runtime logic or data flow that could be malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct; mentions the static nature and compatibility import.\n- **Anomaly noted:** The copyright year \"2025\" is in the future, which is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No dynamic or malicious behavior. The future date is a content anomaly but not a security issue.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 1.\n- **Verdict:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify zero malware risk.\n- **Obfuscated:** Zero obfuscation is evident; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** No runtime behavior, external data handling, or secrets; all scores are appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** High, as all reports agree.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned by all reports are reasonable and consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n- The only content anomaly is the future copyright year (\"2025\"), which is likely a typo or placeholder but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThe code is a safe, static type declaration module with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The code is benign, purely static, and serves as type annotations for AWS resource literals. No changes to scores are necessary.",
