  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS Cloud9 service literals to ensure type safety and improve developer experience.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions, and multiple assignments of Literal types with string constants.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Static type alias definitions; no runtime data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of type alias declarations with string literals. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations using Literal for various AWS service string constants, with a conditional import to maintain compatibility across Python versions. The entire script is static, defining constants for use elsewhere. No input handling, data processing, or external communication is present, reducing risk of malicious activity. The purpose appears solely to improve type safety and code clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as type annotations for AWS SDK literals without any malicious intent or security risks. It contains no dynamic or runtime behaviors that could be exploited. Overall, it is a safe and well-structured module for static type hinting.",
