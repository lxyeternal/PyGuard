{
  "purpose": "To define Python type literals for AWS Cloud9 service literals and related enumerations for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from static string literals assigned to type annotations, and conditionally imports the 'Literal' type from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or execution effects; all literals are static, predefined strings.",
  "flows": "The flow is primarily static type annotation definitions, with no dynamic data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code mainly consists of static literal definitions. The only conditional import from 'typing_extensions' is standard practice for compatibility. The copyright date '2025' is in the future, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a static type definition module for AWS service string literals, facilitating type-safe API calls. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard. The literals cover a broad range of AWS services and statuses, with no runtime logic or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code, no code injection points, no handling of untrusted data, and no network activity are present. The primary purpose appears to be to provide type annotations for other codebases. The future copyright year does not impact security but is unusual.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, purely static definition of string literals for AWS services and statuses, serving as type annotations. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
