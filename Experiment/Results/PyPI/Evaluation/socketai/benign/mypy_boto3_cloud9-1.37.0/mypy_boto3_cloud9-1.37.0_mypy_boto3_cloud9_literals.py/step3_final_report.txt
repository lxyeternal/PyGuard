  "purpose": "Static type annotations defining string literal types for AWS Cloud9 and related AWS resource constants, used for type safety and validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines constants and type aliases statically within the module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; the code does not process or transmit data at runtime.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or runtime logic; the code solely provides static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the copyright year '2025', which is in the future but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static collection of string literal type aliases for AWS resource names, statuses, regions, and actions. It uses conditional imports for compatibility and contains no runtime logic, external communication, secrets, or obfuscated code. All reports correctly identify its benign, static nature. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned by all reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static module for AWS resource literals with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate and appropriate. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security or functionality.",
