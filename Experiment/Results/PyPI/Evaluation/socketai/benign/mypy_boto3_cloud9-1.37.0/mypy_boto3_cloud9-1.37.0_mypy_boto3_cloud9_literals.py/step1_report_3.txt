{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS Cloud9 service and related enumerations to facilitate type checking and validation in Python code.",
  "sources": "Constant string literals assigned to type aliases, imported from standard and third-party typing modules based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code only defines type aliases and constants, no processing of untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or execution logic beyond type alias definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Usage of version check for importing 'Literal' is standard practice; no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type annotations for AWS Cloud9 literals using Python's typing system. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version. All string literals are static, predefined, and serve as type constraints. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or secret handling is present. The large list of AWS service names and regions is static and appears to be standard enumeration data. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of type definitions intended to support type safety in AWS SDK code. It contains no malicious or suspicious content and adheres to common practices for maintaining compatibility across Python versions.",
