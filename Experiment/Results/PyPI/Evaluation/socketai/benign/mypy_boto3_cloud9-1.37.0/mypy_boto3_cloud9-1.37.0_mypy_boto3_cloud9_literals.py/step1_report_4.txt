  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS Cloud9 service and other AWS SDK components for type checking and autocompletion.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions and imports, particularly the 'sys.version_info' check for conditional import.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no data leaks or external network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; no execution of dynamic code or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The code is purely declarative type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations using 'Literal' for various AWS SDK string constants, with a conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, or suspicious behavior. The 'sys.version_info' check is standard for compatibility and does not pose security issues. The code serves solely for static type checking, which is safe. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious set of type definitions for AWS service literals. It does not contain any malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It is purely declarative for type hinting purposes.",
