  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS Cloud9 and related AWS resource constants.\n- It uses conditional imports to maintain compatibility across Python versions.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or external data handling is present.\n- The literals are comprehensive lists of AWS resource names, statuses, regions, and actions.\n- The code contains no secrets, credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.\n- The only notable anomaly is the copyright date \"2025,\" which is in the future but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for AWS Cloud9 literals; no external data sources.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; purely static type definitions.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0; consistent with the static, benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; focus on type safety.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic behavior or security concerns.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk scores at 0; appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations for AWS Cloud9 and other AWS constants.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static definitions, no malicious code or external interactions.\n- **Scores:** Both 0; justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations with version compatibility.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No runtime logic or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Both 0; consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type definitions; note on the future copyright year.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; the future date is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Both 0; justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment**\n\n- **Code Content:** Purely static type alias definitions for AWS resource names, statuses, regions, etc.\n- **Behavior:** No runtime logic, data processing, external communication, or secret handling.\n- **Malware & Security Risks:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Anomalies:** The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year \"2025,\" which is not malicious but somewhat unusual.\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Scores:** All reports correctly assign malware and risk scores as 0.\n- **Potential for Obfuscation:** None observed; code is straightforward.\n- **Security Concerns:** None; the code is purely declarative.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security vulnerabilities or attack vectors)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a safe, static set of type annotations for AWS resource literals, serving as a helpful utility for type checking. No security risks or malicious activity are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that such static declaration files are maintained and updated to reflect current AWS resource names, but from a security standpoint, this code is benign.",
