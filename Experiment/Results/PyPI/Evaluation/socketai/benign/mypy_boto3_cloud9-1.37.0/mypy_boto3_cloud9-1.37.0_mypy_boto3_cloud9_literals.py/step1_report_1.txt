  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS Cloud9 service literals and related constants for use in type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for various AWS service strings, environment statuses, and paginator names; imports of 'sys' and conditional import of 'Literal'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data sinks detected; the code only defines constants and type annotations.",
  "flows": "N/A — No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The code strictly defines type literals.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an unusually large and comprehensive list of string literals, but no suspicious or malicious code behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The import pattern with conditional 'Literal' import is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a set of type alias definitions using 'Literal' to restrict values for various AWS resource names, environment statuses, actions, and regions. It ensures type safety and code correctness but does not execute any logic or perform data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The initial comment block is a documentation string with sample usage. Conditional import ensures compatibility with different Python versions. The large list of string literals appears to be a comprehensive enumeration of AWS resource names, likely for validation or type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static declaration of string literals for type annotations. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior, nor does it perform any runtime operations that could pose security risks. No malware or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
