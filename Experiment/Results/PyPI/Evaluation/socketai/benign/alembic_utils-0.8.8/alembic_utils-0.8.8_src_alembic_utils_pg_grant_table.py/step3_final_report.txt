{
  "purpose": "The code manages PostgreSQL grants by defining data classes and generating SQL statements for grant and revoke operations, sourcing data from database catalog queries and class attributes.",
  "sources": "Database queries fetching grant information from information_schema views; class attributes holding grant parameters.",
  "sinks": "Generated SQL statements for grant and revoke operations executed on the database.",
  "flows": "Data flows from database query results into class instances, then into SQL command strings for execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code activity detected. Use of parameterized queries and quoting functions mitigate injection risks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured utility for managing PostgreSQL permissions, utilizing standard libraries and practices. It reads grant info from system catalogs, constructs grant objects, and generates parameterized SQL statements. The placeholder 'from_sql' method is unimplemented but benign. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scoring of malware as 0, obfuscation as 0, and a low security risk (~0.2) aligns with the code's purpose and implementation details.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure utility for PostgreSQL grant management with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and the overall assessment confirms its safety and correctness.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
