  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external input/output, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The classes serve purely as error markers with descriptive docstrings.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No report mentions any suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or code that could be malicious.\n   - The code is straightforward, standard for defining custom exceptions.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Vulnerabilities:**\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes, it does not process data, handle inputs, or perform any operations that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious constructs are detected.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis and justified by the simplicity and standard nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n   - There are no claims or evidence suggesting malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The reports correctly conclude that the code is benign and purely structural.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities, a risk score of **0** is appropriate.\n\n**Additional Comments:**\n- The high confidence scores (1) are justified.\n- The detailed reasoning in each report aligns with the code's nature.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Keep all scores at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- Confirm that the code is benign and purely structural, serving as a standard exception hierarchy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, harmless set of custom exception classes with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent.",
