  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the AlembicUtils package to handle specific error scenarios.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are implemented; this code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from the base Exception class. These classes serve to categorize and handle different error conditions within the package. There are no input reading, data processing, network operations, or other potentially malicious behaviors. The structure is straightforward and typical for defining custom exceptions in Python. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.",
