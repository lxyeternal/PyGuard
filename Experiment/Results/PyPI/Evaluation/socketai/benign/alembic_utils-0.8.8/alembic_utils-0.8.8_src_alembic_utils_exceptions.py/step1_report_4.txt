  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the AlembicUtils package to handle various error conditions.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data handling occurs; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions inheriting from Exception to provide custom error types. No external input, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present. The exception classes serve as error markers and do not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard practice for Python modules to define custom exceptions in this manner. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security concerns.",
