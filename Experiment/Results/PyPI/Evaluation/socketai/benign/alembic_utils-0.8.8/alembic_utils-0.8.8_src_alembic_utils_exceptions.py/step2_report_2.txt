  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's Exception class. There are no data inputs, outputs, data flows, or processing logic. The code is straightforward and standard for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is purely structural, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.  \n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the summaries.  \n- The reports do not miss any potential issues, as the code is simple and well-understood.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**  \n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n- Obfuscated scores are 0 across all reports, matching the straightforward nature of the code.  \n- Malware scores are 0, which aligns with the absence of any suspicious or malicious behavior.  \n- Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk and Malware Scores**  \n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is justified because there is no malicious activity, such as code injection, network calls, or hidden behaviors.  \n- The security risk score is 0, as the code does not perform any operations that could compromise security.  \n- The risk scores are appropriately low; the code's purpose is purely definitional.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the absence of data flows, input/output, or suspicious patterns.  \n- The reasoning is sound and aligns with best practices for code review.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**  \n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**  \n- The code is benign, standard, and serves a common purpose in Python projects.  \n- No issues, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities are present.  \n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Final Estimation (by the security researcher):**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)  \n\nThe reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code is a typical example of defining custom exceptions with no security concerns.",
