  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the AlembicUtils package to handle specific error cases.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; there are no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code solely declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's Exception class. Each class has a descriptive docstring. There are no function calls, data processing, or any form of data input/output handling. The code is straightforward and standard for defining exception hierarchies, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard set of custom exception classes with no malicious behavior, security issues, or suspicious elements. It appears to be legitimate and purely structural for error handling within a package.",
