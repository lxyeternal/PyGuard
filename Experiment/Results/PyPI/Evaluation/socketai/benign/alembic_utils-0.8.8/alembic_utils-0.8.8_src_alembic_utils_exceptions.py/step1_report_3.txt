  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the AlembicUtils package to handle various error scenarios.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output points are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input processing, or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are straightforward exception definitions with no unusual code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class, each representing a specific error type related to AlembicUtils. No input processing, external data handling, or complex logic is present. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are identified. The code appears to be a standard pattern for custom exceptions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to categorize errors within the AlembicUtils package and does not perform any data processing or external interactions.",
