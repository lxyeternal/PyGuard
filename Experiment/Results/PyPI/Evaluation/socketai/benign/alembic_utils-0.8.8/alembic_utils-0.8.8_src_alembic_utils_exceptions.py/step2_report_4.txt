  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code only defines custom exception classes inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external input/output, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The classes have descriptive docstrings and serve as error markers within the package.\n\n2. **Issues Present in the Code**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural with no malicious behavior.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are detected.\n   - The code is standard for defining exception hierarchies in Python.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and typical for error handling.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Justification**:\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes, there is no malware, malicious intent, or security risk.\n   - The scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n   - The code does not perform any external interactions, data processing, or code execution.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All claims are based on factual analysis; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n   - The reports do not overstate or understate the security implications.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:\nThe code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**My Estimated Scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nNo further action needed.",
