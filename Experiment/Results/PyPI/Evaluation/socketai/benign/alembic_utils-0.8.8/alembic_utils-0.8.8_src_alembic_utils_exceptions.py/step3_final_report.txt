  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the AlembicUtils package.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception class, with no external data input or output.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only establishes class hierarchies for exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard class definitions and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Python's Exception. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. The code is simple, well-structured, and serves as a standard error categorization mechanism. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's benign and structural nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, consistent, and appropriately score the code as safe.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
