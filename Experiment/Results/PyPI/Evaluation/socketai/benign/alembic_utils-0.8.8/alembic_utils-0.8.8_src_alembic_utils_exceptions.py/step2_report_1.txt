  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's Exception class. There are no signs of data input/output, external interactions, or complex logic. The code is straightforward and standard for defining exception hierarchies.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that there are no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:  \n   - **Confidence**: All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n   - **Malware**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code or behavior.  \n   - **Security Risk**: All reports assign 0, which is reasonable since the code is purely structural and does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   Since all scores are 0, there's no need to justify higher risk scores. The code is benign.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. The code only defines exception classes without any malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score**: **0** (no security risk)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis code is benign and serves a purely structural purpose within the larger codebase.",
