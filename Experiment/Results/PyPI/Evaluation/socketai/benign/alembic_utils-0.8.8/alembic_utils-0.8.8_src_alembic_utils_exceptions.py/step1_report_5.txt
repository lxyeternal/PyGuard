{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the AlembicUtils package to handle specific error scenarios.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only class definitions and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception class. Each class includes a descriptive docstring explaining its purpose. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The code is purely structural, serving to facilitate error handling within a larger codebase. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless set of custom exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be part of a larger application’s error handling mechanism.",
