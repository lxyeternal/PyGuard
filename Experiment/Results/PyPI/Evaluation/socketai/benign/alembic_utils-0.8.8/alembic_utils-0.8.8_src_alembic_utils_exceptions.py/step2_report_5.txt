  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's `Exception`. There are no data flows, input/output handling, or external interactions. The code is straightforward and standard for error categorization.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly note the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues.  \n- They emphasize the structural nature of the code and its role in error handling, which is appropriate.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:  \n- All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.  \n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, aligning with the straightforward class definitions.  \n- The `confidence` is 1 across all reports, which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is correct. The code is purely structural and does not pose any security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which matches the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions**:  \n- All reports correctly assume no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.  \n- There are no hidden behaviors or assumptions that could be challenged.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are thorough, accurate, and consistent.\n\n**My Own Estimate**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk, no vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior)\n\n**Final assessment**:  \nThis code is purely structural, serving as part of an error handling mechanism. It poses no security threat or malware risk.",
