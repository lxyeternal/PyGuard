  "purpose": "Define and manage PostgreSQL view objects, including parsing SQL, generating SQL statements for create, drop, or replace, and retrieving views from the database.",
  "sources": "Input SQL strings in 'from_sql' method, database query in 'from_database' method, and input parameters to class constructor.",
  "sinks": "SQL statement generation functions ('to_sql_statement_create', 'to_sql_statement_drop', 'to_sql_statement_create_or_replace') which produce SQL commands; database query execution in 'from_database'.",
  "flows": "Input SQL parsed in 'from_sql' -> parsed components used in object creation -> SQL statement methods generate executable SQL -> 'from_database' fetches view definitions from database.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; SQL statements are constructed via formatted strings but properly parameterized; no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution or unusual code patterns; 'parse' and 'alembic_utils' modules are standard for SQL parsing and code generation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a class for PostgreSQL views with methods for parsing SQL, generating SQL statements, and retrieving views from a database. No user input is directly used in SQL string concatenation that could lead to injection; the SQL statements are constructed with formatted strings but rely on parsed and normalized input, not untrusted data. The methods perform standard database operations and SQL string creation with no indication of malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network communications, nor any obfuscation or hidden backdoors. The only potential concern could be reliance on external 'parse' and 'alembic_utils' modules, but they are standard in SQL parsing and code management contexts. Overall, the code does not contain any malicious behavior or supply chain threats.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard implementation for managing PostgreSQL views with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs legitimate functions like parsing SQL, generating view statements, and querying database views, all using typical patterns without malicious or harmful behavior.",
