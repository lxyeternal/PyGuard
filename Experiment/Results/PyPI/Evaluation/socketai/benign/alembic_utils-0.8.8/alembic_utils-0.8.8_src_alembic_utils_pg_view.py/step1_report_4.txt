  "purpose": "Define and manage PostgreSQL views through SQL parsing and generation, including creating, dropping, and retrieving views from the database.",
  "sources": "SQL input strings in from_sql method; database query in from_database method; class instantiation with schema, signature, and definition parameters.",
  "sinks": "SQL statement creation methods (to_sql_statement_create, to_sql_statement_drop, to_sql_statement_create_or_replace) which generate executable SQL commands.",
  "flows": "SQL strings parsed from create statements are used to instantiate PGView objects, which then generate SQL commands to create or drop views. The from_database method executes a database query to retrieve existing views.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The use of exception handling in create_or_replace appears standard. No obfuscation, no suspicious dynamic code execution, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily parses, constructs, and executes SQL related to PostgreSQL views. The from_sql method uses a predefined template to parse CREATE VIEW statements, which appears straightforward. The to_sql methods generate SQL commands based on object attributes. The from_database method retrieves view definitions without processing untrusted data beyond the normal database query, which is typical. There are no signs of malicious data exfiltration, system compromise, or hidden backdoors. All SQL statements are parameterized or constructed from class attributes, reducing injection risk. The code does not handle or process user input insecurely; it mainly interfaces with the database via safe SQL commands. No suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for managing PostgreSQL views with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It safely parses, generates, and executes SQL statements related to views, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
