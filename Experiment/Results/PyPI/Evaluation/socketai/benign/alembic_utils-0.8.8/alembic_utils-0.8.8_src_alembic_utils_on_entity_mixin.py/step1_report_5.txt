{
  "purpose": "Defines a mixin class for entities requiring an 'ON' clause, facilitating code generation and schema management.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type hints, and input parameters such as 'schema', 'signature', 'definition', 'on_entity'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'coerce_to_unquoted' to process 'on_entity', and string formatting for rendering code and identity strings.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through methods to generate string representations; 'on_entity' is processed and incorporated into output strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Use of 'coerce_to_unquoted' is a standard utility function, not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing database entities requiring an 'ON' clause. It conditionally imports types for type checking and processes the 'on_entity' parameter, adding a 'public.' schema prefix if absent, then coercing it for safe string use. String formatting is used to generate code snippets and identity strings. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities. The code appears to be standard, utility-focused Python for schema management with no hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility class for managing schema-related entities with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
