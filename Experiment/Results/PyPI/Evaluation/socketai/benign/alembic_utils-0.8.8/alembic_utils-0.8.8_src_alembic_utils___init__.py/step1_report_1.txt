  "sinks": "Potentially writing to files, sending data over network, or executing commands based on the code structure.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or external inputs to sinks like network calls or file writes, but explicit flow details are unavailable.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual language features or unnecessary dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The provided code segment is empty or incomplete, preventing detailed source-to-sink flow analysis. Based on the current content, no malicious behavior, code injection, or security risks are evident. Lack of context limits confidence in identifying hidden threats.",
  "conclusion": "No malicious intent or security risks are identifiable in the provided code snippet. The code appears benign, but incomplete information prevents a definitive assessment. Further code details are necessary for a comprehensive review.",
