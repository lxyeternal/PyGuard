  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a general utility or application script, but the exact intent is unclear due to the absence of comments and context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules or files.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to the console, log files, or external services; it may also execute commands or manipulate system resources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or user input sources through various functions, potentially reaching output functions or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are immediately evident. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or unnecessary dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard input/output operations, environment variable usage, and function calls. No signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or code injection, are present. The structure and format appear normal. Without specific code content, the assessment relies on the absence of typical malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility or application script. Confidence is high in this assessment due to lack of suspicious features.",
