{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for managing PostgreSQL materialized views, including creation, dropping, and parsing SQL statements.",
  "sources": "Input SQL strings in 'from_sql' method, database query in 'from_database', class instantiation parameters, and method parameters such as 'schema' and 'definition'.",
  "sinks": "SQL statement generation functions like 'to_sql_statement_create', 'to_sql_statement_drop', and 'to_sql_statement_create_or_replace', which produce SQL commands executed on the database.",
  "flows": "Input SQL strings are parsed in 'from_sql', then potentially transformed into SQL statements by 'to_sql_statement_create' or 'to_sql_statement_drop'. Database data is fetched in 'from_database' and processed into class instances.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code detected. Use of 'parse' with multiple templates could introduce parsing inconsistencies but is not malicious. No external network or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily focused on parsing, generating, and executing SQL statements for PostgreSQL materialized views. It uses established libraries for parsing and SQL construction. No evident malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors is present. The 'from_sql' method safely parses input SQL strings; the SQL generation methods construct standard SQL commands. The database query in 'from_database' retrieves view definitions securely. No hardcoded secrets or risky behaviors detected. Overall, the code is a straightforward utility class with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for managing PostgreSQL materialized views. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident, and it functions as intended to facilitate database schema management. No evidence of obfuscation or malware present.",
