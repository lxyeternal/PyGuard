  "purpose": "Define and manage PostgreSQL materialized views, including parsing, creation, dropping, and reconstruction from database.",
  "sources": "Input SQL strings in 'from_sql' method, database query results in 'from_database' method, and class instantiation parameters.",
  "sinks": "SQL statement generation methods ('to_sql_statement_create', 'to_sql_statement_drop', 'to_sql_statement_create_or_replace', 'render_self_for_migration') which produce SQL commands, and the database execution in 'from_database'.",
  "flows": "SQL strings parsed in 'from_sql' flow into class attributes; class attributes used to generate SQL commands; database query results flow into object creation in 'from_database'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. Usage of string templates and parsing appears standard. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or suspicious logic identified.",
  "analysis": "The code focuses on handling PostgreSQL materialized views, with methods for parsing SQL, generating SQL commands, and reconstructing object state. Parsing templates are straightforward, and SQL generation uses string formatting with class attributes. No user input, network operations, or sensitive data handling is present. The code relies on standard libraries and methods for SQL handling and string manipulation. No signs of malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are evident. The database query is a typical metadata fetch for views, with no suspicious filtering or data collection. Overall, the code appears safe, intended for database schema management without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard utility for managing PostgreSQL materialized views. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It safely parses SQL, generates SQL statements, and interacts with the database for metadata retrieval. No security risks or malware signs are detected.",
