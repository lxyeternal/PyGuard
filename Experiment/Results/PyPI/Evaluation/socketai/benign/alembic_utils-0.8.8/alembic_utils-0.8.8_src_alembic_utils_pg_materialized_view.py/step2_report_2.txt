  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the accuracy of their assessments and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a utility class for managing PostgreSQL materialized views, involving parsing SQL, generating SQL statements, and querying the database for existing views.\n- No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The parsing uses templates that could be fragile but are not malicious.\n- The SQL statements generated are standard DDL commands.\n- The database interactions are straightforward and secure.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Malware and Obfuscated Scores**\n\nAll reports assign `malware=0` and `obfuscated=0`. Given the code's nature, this is reasonable. There are no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n### 2. **Security Risk Scores**\n\nMost reports assign a low security risk (~0.1–0.2). This aligns with the code's purpose and implementation. No risky behaviors are evident.\n\n### 3. **Flow and Logic Validity**\n\n- The `from_sql` method's use of multiple templates for parsing SQL statements is flexible but could be brittle if SQL syntax varies significantly. Still, it's not malicious.\n- The `to_sql_statement_create` and related methods generate standard SQL commands.\n- The `from_database` method fetches view metadata securely.\n\n### 4. **Potential Flaws or Concerns**\n\n- The reliance on string templates in `from_sql` could lead to parsing errors if SQL syntax differs, but this is a known limitation, not a security flaw.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection.\n\n### 5. **Scores Consistency and Justification**\n\n- All reports' scores for malware and obfuscated are appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are low, consistent with the code's functionality.\n- The confidence levels are high (~0.9–0.95), which is justified given the thoroughness of the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Recommendations:**\n\n- **Scores for malware and obfuscated:** Remain at 0, as no malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- **Security risk:** Keep low (~0.1–0.2), as the code is primarily a utility with no evident vulnerabilities.\n- **Confidence:** High, given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** (consistent with the reports)  \n\n**Overall, the code is safe, non-malicious, and functions as intended for managing PostgreSQL materialized views. No adjustments to the scores are necessary.**\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the low security risk scores are justified.",
