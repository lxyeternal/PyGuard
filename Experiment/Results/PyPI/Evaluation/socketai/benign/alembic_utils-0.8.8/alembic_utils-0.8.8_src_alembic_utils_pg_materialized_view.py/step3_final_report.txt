  "purpose": "Utility class for managing PostgreSQL materialized views, including parsing SQL definitions, generating SQL statements, and retrieving view metadata from the database.",
  "sources": "SQL strings provided to 'from_sql', database query results in 'from_database', class attributes such as 'definition', 'schema', 'signature'.",
  "sinks": "Generated SQL statements via 'to_sql_statement_create', 'to_sql_statement_drop', 'to_sql_statement_create_or_replace'; database queries in 'from_database'.",
  "flows": "Input SQL strings are parsed in 'from_sql' to populate class attributes; 'to_sql_statement_create' and similar methods generate SQL commands from attributes; 'from_database' fetches view info to instantiate objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns. Parsing templates could be fragile but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for managing PostgreSQL materialized views. It parses SQL definitions using template matching, generates SQL DDL statements, and retrieves view metadata from the database. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The parsing approach, while flexible, could be brittle if SQL syntax varies, but this does not constitute a security issue. The SQL commands generated are standard, and database interactions are safe. The code does not handle secrets, perform network activity, or execute untrusted code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent across all reports. The overall assessment is that the code is benign, serving as a utility for schema management, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for managing PostgreSQL materialized views. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
