  "purpose": "Define and handle PostgreSQL materialized view objects for creating, dropping, and parsing SQL statements related to materialized views, mainly for migration and database introspection.",
  "sources": "Input SQL strings in from_sql method, database query results in from_database method, and class instantiation parameters.",
  "sinks": "SQL statement construction methods (to_sql_statement_create, to_sql_statement_drop, to_sql_statement_create_or_replace), and render_self_for_migration output.",
  "flows": "from_sql parses SQL input to object; from_database retrieves database views; to_sql methods generate SQL statements; render_self_for_migration outputs Python code for migration.",
  "anomalies": "The code predominantly generates SQL statements and performs parsing with no evident hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No suspicious external network or file operations. No obfuscated code features observed. The only unusual aspect is reliance on string parsing and template matching for SQL parsing, which could be error-prone but not malicious per se.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for managing PostgreSQL materialized views in a migration context. It employs SQL parsing to interpret view creation SQL statements, and generates SQL commands for creation, dropping, and replacing views. It also can produce Python code snippets for migrations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. Usage of external libraries is limited to SQL parsing, string handling, and SQL statement building. No hardcoded secrets, no malicious code injection, or suspicious flows are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility class for managing PostgreSQL materialized views in database migrations, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on input SQL strings and database queries, generating appropriate SQL statements and code snippets. Overall, it is safe and does not contain malware.",
