{
  "purpose": "Manage PostgreSQL extensions within Alembic migrations, generating SQL statements for creation, dropping, and querying extensions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'schema' and 'signature', database query in 'from_database' method.",
  "sinks": "SQL statements constructed via string formatting in 'to_sql_statement_create' and 'to_sql_statement_drop'.",
  "flows": "Inputs 'schema' and 'signature' are normalized and used in SQL statements; 'from_database' fetches extension data using parameterized query.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The SQL statement construction could be improved by using parameter binding instead of string interpolation.",
  "analysis": "The code manages PostgreSQL extensions safely, using parameterized queries in database fetches and input normalization to prevent injection. The SQL statements are constructed via string formatting, but since 'signature' and 'schema' are sanitized, injection risk is minimal. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The 'to_sql_statement_create_or_replace' method is unimplemented, which is acceptable if intended for future extension. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1), justified by the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility for managing PostgreSQL extensions with no evidence of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; minor improvements could include using parameter binding for all SQL statement constructions for consistency. Overall, the code is safe and well-implemented.",
