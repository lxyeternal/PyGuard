  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Type definitions and data schemas for Amazon Chime SDK media pipelines, used for type checking and validation.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Data flows from external inputs (function parameters, data sources) into TypedDicts; no malicious operations detected.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The code is purely declarative with type annotations.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, intended for type validation, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as purely declarative type definitions. No malware or obfuscation detected. Risk score: **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Type definitions for AWS Chime SDK media pipelines, used for data validation and SDK interactions.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** No data processing or external data handling; data flows are for serialization/deserialization.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. The code is standard for SDK type definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is a standard SDK type schema. Risk score: **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Type annotations and data structures for the SDK, facilitating type checking.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Data flows from API inputs to data schemas; no code execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is purely declarative.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, SDK data models only.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malware or obfuscation. Risk score: **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Type definitions for the SDK, used for data validation and type safety.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** No runtime data handling or external operations; data structures for API payloads.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. Standard SDK pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purely declarative.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. Risk score: **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Type annotations and data models for the API, for structured communication.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Data flows are static, used for serialization/deserialization.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No code execution, secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard SDK type definitions.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. Risk score: **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports agree that the code is purely declarative type definitions with no executable logic, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward, with conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Since the code is only defining data schemas for SDK use, it poses no security risk. The risk score should be **0** across the board.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The malware score should be **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n- The overall security risk is **0**.\n\nThis code is standard, auto-generated SDK type definitions intended for validation and type safety, with no malicious intent or behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nAll reports are consistent with this assessment.",
