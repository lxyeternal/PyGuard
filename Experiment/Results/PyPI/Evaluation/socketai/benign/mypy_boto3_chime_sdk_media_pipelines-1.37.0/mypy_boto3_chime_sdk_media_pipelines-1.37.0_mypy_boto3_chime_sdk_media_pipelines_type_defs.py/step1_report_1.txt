  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structure schemas for Amazon Chime SDK media pipelines service in Python, used for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, sys.version_info, and defines TypedDict and Union structures for data validation.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data flows to potentially malicious operations such as network transmission or system modification.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs such as function parameters and data source definitions into TypedDict structures, with no code execution or data manipulation logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is purely declarative with type annotations and data schemas. No use of dynamic execution, eval, or suspicious imports. The presence of copyright notice is typical for open-source code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive set of TypedDicts and type unions for the AWS Chime SDK media pipeline service. It includes imports for type checking modules and conditional imports for compatibility with different Python versions. No functions, external commands, network operations, or code execution constructs are present. The data schemas appear standard and are solely used for type validation and documentation. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code segments, and no suspicious logic or data handling practices observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative type definition schema for a service SDK and contains no malicious behavior. It is safe and intended for type checking and API validation purposes only.",
