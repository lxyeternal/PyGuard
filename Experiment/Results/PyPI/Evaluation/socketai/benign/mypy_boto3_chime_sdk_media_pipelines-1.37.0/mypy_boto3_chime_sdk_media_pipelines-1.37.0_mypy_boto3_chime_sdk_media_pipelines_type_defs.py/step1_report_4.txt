{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS Chime SDK Media Pipelines service, used for data validation and type safety in SDK implementations.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, imported modules, and constants defining data structures; no direct data input sources like user input or network calls.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe data flows could occur if external data is used improperly, but this code only defines types; no actual data processing or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Type definitions describe data structures but do not implement runtime data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly contains Python type annotations, TypedDict definitions, Union types, and conditional imports based on Python version. It is purely declarative, aimed at defining data structures for SDK communication. There are no runtime behaviors, network calls, or data processing logic that could be malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. All imported modules are standard or type extension libraries, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious obfuscation techniques. The structure aligns with typical SDK type definitions for data validation and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for AWS Chime SDK Media Pipelines, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate, purely declarative module for SDK data validation. No malware or security risks are present based on the analysis.",
