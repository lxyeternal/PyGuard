{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data schemas for AWS Chime SDK media pipelines, used for type checking, validation, and SDK development.",
  "sources": "Type definitions, TypedDicts, Union types, conditional imports for compatibility, and static data structures used for API request/response modeling.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into type schemas from external API inputs or SDK calls; no runtime data handling or code execution occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "External data (e.g., API responses, requests) mapped into TypedDicts and Union types for validation and type safety.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is purely declarative, with standard conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Python type annotations, TypedDict definitions, Union types, and conditional imports to ensure compatibility across Python versions. It defines data schemas for the AWS Chime SDK media pipelines service, with no executable logic, network operations, or dynamic code. The extensive use of type hints and conditional imports is standard for SDKs. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is to facilitate type safety and data validation, not to perform any operations or data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of SDK type definitions for AWS Chime media pipelines, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It is purely declarative, used for validation and documentation, and poses no threat in its current form.",
