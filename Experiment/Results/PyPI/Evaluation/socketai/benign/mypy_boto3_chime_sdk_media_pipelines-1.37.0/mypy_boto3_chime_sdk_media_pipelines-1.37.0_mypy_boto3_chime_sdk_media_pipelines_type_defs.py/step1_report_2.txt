{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS Chime SDK media pipelines service, used for data validation and type checking in SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (sys, datetime, typing, collections.abc), internal literals module, and type annotations used throughout class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code primarily consists of TypedDict definitions and type annotations with no data processing or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Type annotations and data structure definitions do not contain executable data flows; they define data shapes for SDK use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or backdoors present. The code is straightforward type definition code.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively provides TypedDict data structures for the SDK's service types, including request/response formats, configurations, and resource definitions. It imports only necessary modules and conditional typing support. No execution logic, external data handling, or potentially malicious operations are present. The structure is consistent with auto-generated AWS SDK type definitions and contains no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for the AWS Chime SDK media pipelines, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It is purely declarative, intended for type safety and validation, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
