{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for literals used in the chime-sdk-media-pipelines service for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "The literals are hardcoded string values assigned to type aliases; no external data sources or inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or data processing steps involving untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hidden code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious patterns, are present. The code primarily consists of static type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' to check Python version and conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It defines multiple string literal type aliases for various service-related constants, which are used for type hinting in larger codebases. The literals are straightforward, static, and do not include any dynamic execution, external data reading, or suspicious behavior. The license and documentation comments are benign and relate to type annotations for AWS SDK-like services. No malware or malicious patterns are detected in the static definitions or import logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static type alias definitions for AWS service literals. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a type-safe reference for constants used elsewhere. Overall, this code is safe and purely for type annotation purposes.",
