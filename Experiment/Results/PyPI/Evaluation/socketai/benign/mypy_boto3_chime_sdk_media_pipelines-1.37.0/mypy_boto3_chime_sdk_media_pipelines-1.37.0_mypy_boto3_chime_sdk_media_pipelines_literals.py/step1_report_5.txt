{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS boto3 SDK service, resource, region, and media pipeline-related constants for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'sys' and 'typing' modules, and the assignment of string literals to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. The code appears to be straightforward type annotation definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' to check Python version for conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It then defines multiple variables as string literal types for use in type annotations related to AWS services and media pipelines. There is no data processing, user input handling, or external communication. The structure is static and solely for type hints. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code purely provides type definitions for AWS SDK constants with no signs of malicious intent. It is a standard, safe module for type annotations in larger projects. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified.",
