  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for enumerations used in the AWS chime-sdk-media-pipelines service, serving as static type annotations for better code safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys and typing_extensions, and static literal definitions for various string-based enums.",
  "sinks": "None; static definitions without runtime data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of conditional import for compatibility and extensive static Literal type definitions for enumerations. It contains no functions, I/O, dynamic code, or external data processing. The literals are comprehensive and serve as type hints. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code's purpose is purely static typing support, which aligns with best practices for SDK type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static type annotation module defining string literals for AWS SDK enumerations. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and appropriate.",
