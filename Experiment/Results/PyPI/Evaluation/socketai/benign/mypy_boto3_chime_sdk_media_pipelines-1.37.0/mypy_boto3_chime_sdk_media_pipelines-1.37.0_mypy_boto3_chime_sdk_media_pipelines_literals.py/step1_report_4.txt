  "purpose": "Define type literals for various string-based enumerations used in the chime-sdk-media-pipelines service for type safety and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys, conditional import of Literal, and the assignment of string literals to various type aliases.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code primarily consists of type definitions and no data processing or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows or data handling occurs. This code only defines constants and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution present. The code structure is standard for type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines a series of string literal types for use elsewhere. No external input, data processing, or side effects are present. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are detected. The file appears to be a static, well-structured set of type definitions intended for type checking and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static definition of string literal types for a specific service API. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard pattern for type annotations and documentation support, with no signs of malware or security issues.",
