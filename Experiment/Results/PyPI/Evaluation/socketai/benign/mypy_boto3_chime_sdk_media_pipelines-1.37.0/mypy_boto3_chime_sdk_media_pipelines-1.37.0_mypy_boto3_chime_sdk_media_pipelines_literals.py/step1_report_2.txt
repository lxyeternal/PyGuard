  "purpose": "Type annotations for chime-sdk-media-pipelines service literal definitions, providing type hints for various string literal values used in the SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and typing modules; definitions of Literal types for various service-specific string literals.",
  "sinks": "None. The code does not process untrusted data, input/output, or perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable. No data flow from source to sink as there are no data inputs or outputs; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be straightforward type annotations with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version checking logic to conditionally import 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions', then defines numerous Literal types representing specific string values used in the AWS SDK for chime media pipelines and related services. There is no dynamic code, no execution, no data processing, or external interactions. The content is purely static type definitions for type hinting, with a comment and documentation string at the beginning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of type annotations for AWS SDK literals. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. Its purpose is to provide type hints for static analysis tools. No security issues or malware are present.",
