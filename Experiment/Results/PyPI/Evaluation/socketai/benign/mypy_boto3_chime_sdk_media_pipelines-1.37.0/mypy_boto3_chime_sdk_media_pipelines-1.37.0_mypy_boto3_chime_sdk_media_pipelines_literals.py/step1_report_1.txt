  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for various string-based enumerations used in the chime-sdk-media-pipelines service for type safety and validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions, definitions of string literal types and all module exports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or user input; purely static type definitions and imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no runtime data processing, just type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of extensive string literal definitions and conditional import for typing.Literal based on Python version; no suspicious code behavior or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static type annotation definitions for literals, intended to provide type safety in Python codebases. It includes a conditional import to maintain compatibility with different Python versions, which is standard. There are no functions, network operations, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. The initial import of sys and conditional import of Literal is benign and common in type hinting modules. The extensive list of string literals appears to be comprehensive enumeration options for the SDK's components, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static type definitions module for enum-like string literals, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is designed solely for type safety and code clarity. No malware signals or security risks are detected.",
