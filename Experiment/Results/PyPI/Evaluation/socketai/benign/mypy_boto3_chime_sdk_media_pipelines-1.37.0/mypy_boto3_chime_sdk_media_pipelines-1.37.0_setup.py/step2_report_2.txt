  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No report indicates any dynamic code execution, external data input, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code is static, reads a local README file, and defines package metadata.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or signs of malware are identified across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly reads the README.md file and supplies static metadata to `setup()`.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No network calls, environment variable manipulations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- **Dependencies:** The only conditional dependency is `typing-extensions`, which is standard.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, justified by the absence of any security concerns.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is a conventional `setup.py` script with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying the benign nature.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all findings are based on static analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. All data is static and local, with no external or untrusted inputs or outputs.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately score the package as safe. No changes are necessary.",
