{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up a Python package 'mypy-boto3-chime-sdk-media-pipelines' including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; uses static package data; reads no external or untrusted input at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or cause security issues.",
  "flows": "The code primarily assigns static strings and variables; no dynamic or untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is a standard setup script with no obfuscated or unusual features.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a static README file for long description, and calls setup() with static, predefined metadata. All inputs are hardcoded or read from a local file; no untrusted sources or dynamic code execution present. No signs of malicious activity, such as network communication, code injection, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a legitimate package setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is standard and appears free of malicious code or security risks. It safely defines package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
