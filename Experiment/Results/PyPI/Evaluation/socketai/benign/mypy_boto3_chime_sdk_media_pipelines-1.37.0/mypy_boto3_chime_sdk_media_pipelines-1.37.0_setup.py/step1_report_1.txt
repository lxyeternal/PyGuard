  "purpose": "This script sets up and installs the mypy-boto3-chime-sdk-media-pipelines package, providing metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; static package metadata; dependencies specified in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable manipulation; no dynamic code execution or external input handling.",
  "flows": "N/A - static setup configuration with no data flow or input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, utilizing setuptools. It reads a local README file for description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and project URLs, and does not include any dynamic code execution or external data input. All data appears static and intended for package configuration purposes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign package setup file with no malicious intent or security issues. It only configures package installation parameters and does not perform any malicious actions.",
