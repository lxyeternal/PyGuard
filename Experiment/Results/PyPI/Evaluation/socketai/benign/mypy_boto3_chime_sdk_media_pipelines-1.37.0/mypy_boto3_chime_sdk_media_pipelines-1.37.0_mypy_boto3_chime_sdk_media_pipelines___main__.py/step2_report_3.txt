  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details.\n- There are no signs of external data fetching, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n- The code's logic is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code reads command-line arguments to decide which static info to print, then outputs to stdout.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- The obfuscation scores are 0, indicating no obfuscation or code hiding techniques.\n- The confidence scores are 1.0, reflecting high certainty in their assessments.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The code is extremely simple and static; there are no dynamic or external data interactions.\n- The only potential concern could be if the static strings contained malicious links or payloads, but they appear to be documentation URLs and package info, which are safe.\n- The code does not process user input beyond checking for \"--version,\" so no injection or command execution risks.\n\n**Scores consistency:**\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and appropriate given the code's nature.\n- No adjustments are necessary based on the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is entirely benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reported analysis and scores are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThe code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static information, posing no security threat.",
