  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) to determine output.",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to `sys.stdout` via `sys.stdout.write`.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' in `sys.argv` and then either calls `print_version()` or `print_info()`, which write static data to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI script that outputs static package info or version. It reads command-line arguments and writes static strings to stdout. No external data fetching, network calls, dynamic code execution, or user input processing beyond argument check. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The logic is simple and serves an informational purpose. All signals indicate benign behavior with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
