  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI script that outputs static package information or version details.\n   - It checks for the `--version` argument and prints the version if present; otherwise, it prints package info.\n   - There are no external data fetches, network requests, dynamic code execution, or user input processing beyond argument checking.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious segments.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security and Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.\n   - No external data or network communication occurs.\n   - The output is static and controlled.\n   - No obfuscation or complex logic that could hide malicious intent.\n   - The code serves a simple informational purpose.\n\n3. **Review of Reports:**\n   - All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of security risks.\n   - They assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and overall security risk of 0.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1.0), consistent with the simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Correctly set to 0; no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly set to 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** Appropriately 0, as the script does not pose any security threat.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Misjudgments:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No assumptions are made beyond the static analysis.\n   - The code's purpose is purely informational, with no hidden behavior.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is safe, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate.\n   - No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no security risks)\n\nThe reports are consistent with my assessment. The code is a benign CLI utility with no security concerns.",
