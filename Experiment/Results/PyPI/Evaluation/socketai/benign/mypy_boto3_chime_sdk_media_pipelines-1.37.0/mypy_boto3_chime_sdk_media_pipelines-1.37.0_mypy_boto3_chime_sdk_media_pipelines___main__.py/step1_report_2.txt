  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no external data fetching or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI script that provides static information about a package. It only reads command-line arguments and writes fixed strings to standard output. There are no external network requests, data leaks, or obfuscated segments. The functions are simple and serve informational purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended for informational CLI output without any malicious intent or security risks.",
