  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides information about boto3 ChimeSDKMediaPipelines.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments; sys.stdout for outputting information.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout for printing info and version; sys.argv for input.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) to output version or package info, then terminate or proceed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. The code reads command-line args and outputs static info. No dynamic execution or external data fetching.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it outputs static package info or version based on command-line args. There are no data leaks, code injections, or malicious behaviors. The code does not interact with network resources, files, or environment variables beyond standard output. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a CLI utility to display package information and version. It contains no malicious intent, no external data handling, and no security risks. It appears safe.",
