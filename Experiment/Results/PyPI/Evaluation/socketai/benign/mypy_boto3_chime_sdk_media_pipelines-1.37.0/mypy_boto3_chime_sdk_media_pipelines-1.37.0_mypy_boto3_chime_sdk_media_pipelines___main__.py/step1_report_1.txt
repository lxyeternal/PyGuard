{
  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the package, including version and documentation details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout.write for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data to stdout; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted elsewhere",
  "flows": "Command-line input (argv) controls whether version info or package info is printed, both outputs are controlled and static",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward and primarily outputs static information.",
  "analysis": "The script checks for '--version' in command-line arguments and outputs package version if present; otherwise, it outputs package info. There is no user input processing beyond argument check. The outputs are static strings with no dynamic or external data involved. No suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code is present. The code appears to serve a simple CLI purpose with no external communication, data manipulation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI entry point that outputs static package information and version details. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
