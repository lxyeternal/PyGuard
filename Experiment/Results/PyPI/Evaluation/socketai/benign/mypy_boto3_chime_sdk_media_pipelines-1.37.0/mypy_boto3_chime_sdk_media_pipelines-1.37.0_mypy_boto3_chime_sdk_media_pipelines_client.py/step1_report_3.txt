{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the boto3 chime-sdk-media-pipelines service, providing a structured interface for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, typing, botocore exceptions, and local type definitions; class and method definitions reading parameters and possibly returning data.",
  "sinks": "Methods returning string URLs (generate_presigned_url), and methods accepting kwargs for API calls that could potentially be exploited if misused (e.g., create, delete, update functions).",
  "flows": "Input parameters (kwargs) flow into API method calls; return values include API responses or URLs; exception handling may route errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors; code adheres to typical AWS SDK client patterns. No obfuscated code or hidden logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured type stub for AWS SDK, defining a client class with methods for each API operation and an exception class. It imports necessary modules and types, checks Python version compatibility, and documents method purposes and URLs. No malicious or suspicious behavior observed; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unauthorized data access identified. The code appears to be a standard SDK interface wrapper with clear, documented API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard SDK interface implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It provides type annotations and method signatures for AWS Chime SDK media pipelines operations, with no security risks or malware detected.",
