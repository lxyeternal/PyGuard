  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the AWS Chime SDK Media Pipelines service, providing methods to create, retrieve, delete, and manage media pipelines and configurations.",
  "sources": "Module imports, class attribute definitions, method signatures, and documentation URLs. No user input or external data sources are explicitly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "Method calls that could potentially send data over the network via boto3, but these are standard API calls to AWS services. No data leaks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Method invocations (sources) trigger API calls (sinks) to AWS services. No evidence of untrusted data flow or malicious command execution pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. Usage of type annotations and property definitions follows standard practices. No backdoors, code injections, or hidden functionalities detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions, method signatures with type annotations, and documentation links. It strictly defines an interface for AWS service interactions with no data processing, user input handling, or executable logic that could be malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity is apparent. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured client interface for a specific AWS service, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a type-annotated client interface for AWS Chime SDK Media Pipelines, with no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard SDK wrapper with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
