  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the boto3-based Amazon Chime SDK media pipelines service.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local type definitions; class and method definitions; property and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations (mostly pass-through to boto3) with no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; method signatures suggest direct API calls with user-supplied parameters, but no execution of untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. The code is primarily type annotations and API wrapper definitions. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type annotations, client exceptions, and a client class for the chime-sdk-media-pipelines service. All methods are wrappers around boto3 API calls with no embedded or executing untrusted code, no data leakage mechanisms, or suspicious patterns. The class and methods are documentation-like wrappers, with no evidence of malicious intent. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors found. The code appears to be part of a type-safe SDK layer, intended to facilitate API interaction with AWS, and does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type-annotated SDK wrapper for AWS Chime SDK media pipelines with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It is safe and purely for structured API interaction.",
