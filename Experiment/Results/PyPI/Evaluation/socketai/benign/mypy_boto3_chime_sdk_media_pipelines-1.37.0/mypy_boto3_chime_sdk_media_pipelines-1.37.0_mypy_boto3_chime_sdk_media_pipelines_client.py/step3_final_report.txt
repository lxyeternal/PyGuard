  "purpose": "Type annotations for the AWS Chime SDK media pipelines client, defining method signatures and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore, type definitions, and class method signatures.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network data exfiltration, or code execution observed.",
  "flows": "Method calls with kwargs, standard API interactions without data leaks or malicious flow.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year 2025, likely a placeholder; no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK interface class with method signatures, type annotations, and documentation links. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, or embedded payloads. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not security-related.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SDK client wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score of approximately 0.1 is appropriate given the nature of SDK interfaces and the placeholder date.",
