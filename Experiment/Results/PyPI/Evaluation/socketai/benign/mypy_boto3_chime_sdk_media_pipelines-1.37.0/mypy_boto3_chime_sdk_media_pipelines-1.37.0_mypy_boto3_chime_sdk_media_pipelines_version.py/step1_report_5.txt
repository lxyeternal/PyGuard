  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module, serving as a source of truth for versioning.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string '__version__' assigned to '1.37.0'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data transmission.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code simply assigns a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious activities are observed. The code contains a copyright statement but no malicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of a version string with a copyright comment. There are no functions, external input handling, data processing, or network operations. The code appears to be standard versioning metadata, which is common in Python packages. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version declaration with no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies. It serves a standard purpose in Python packages.",
