  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe code is a minimal Python module defining a version string:\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.0\"\n```\nIt only assigns a static string to `__version__` and includes a copyright notice. There are no functions, data processing, external communications, or obfuscated/malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of a copyright statement.**\n- **Static assignment of version string.**\n- **No malicious indicators or suspicious code behavior.**\n\n**All reports agree that the code is benign and serves as a version identifier.**\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1-5 Summary:\n- All describe the code as a straightforward version declaration.\n- No data flows, external inputs, or outputs.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code.\n- The only anomaly noted is the future year 2025 in the copyright.\n\n**Are these observations correct?**  \nYes. The code is simple and standard for versioning.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or errors in the reports:\n- **No errors or flaws** are present in the reasoning.  \n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes, they are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since no malicious or suspicious behavior is detected, scores higher than 0 are unwarranted.\n- The only questionable aspect is the future year 2025, but this is not malicious—more likely a placeholder or typo.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- The future year could be a sign of placeholder or oversight, but not security-related.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a standard version declaration with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
