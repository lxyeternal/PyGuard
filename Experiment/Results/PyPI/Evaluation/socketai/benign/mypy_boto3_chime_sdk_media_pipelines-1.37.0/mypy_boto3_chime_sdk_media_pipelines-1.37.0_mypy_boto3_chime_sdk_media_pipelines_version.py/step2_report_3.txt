  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code presence and functionality:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static version string to `__version__` and includes a copyright comment. There are no dynamic behaviors, data flows, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious indicators or suspicious behavior.  \n- The only anomaly noted is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future, but this is not a security concern.  \n- No report mentions that the version string is consistent across all reports; they all specify \"1.37.0\", which is consistent.\n\n3. **Scores review:**  \n- All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores as 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.  \n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, which is correct given the straightforward assignment.  \n- The `confidence` scores are all 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign, which seems appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n- No report assigns a `securityRisk` or `malware` score above 0, which is appropriate.  \n- The code is purely metadata, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct given the code's simplicity.  \n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are claimed or implied.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about potential vulnerabilities; they focus on the code's actual behavior.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.  \n- The confidence levels are high, which is justified.\n\n**Summary of my own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk, as the code is just a static assignment.\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The only minor point is the future copyright year, which might be worth noting as a placeholder or inconsistency, but it does not impact security.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
