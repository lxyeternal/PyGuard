  "purpose": "Defines the version string for the package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable with a string value.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "None; static assignment of a version string.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year is set to 2025, which is a future date and potentially suspicious, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, which is standard practice for Python packages. No external input is read, and no data is transmitted or processed. The only unusual aspect is the copyright year 2025, which may indicate an inconsistency or placeholder but does not indicate malicious intent. There are no suspicious functions, obfuscated code, or embedded commands.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign and serves the purpose of version tracking.",
