  "purpose": "Define a static version string for the package, serving as a source of truth for versioning.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code is a static assignment within the module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment of version string without external input or output.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future year '2025' in the copyright comment, which may be a placeholder or typo but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that assigns a version string to __version__ with a copyright notice. No functions, data processing, external communication, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The only unusual aspect is the future year 2025, which is likely a placeholder. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is straightforward and contains no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent, and no adjustments are necessary.",
