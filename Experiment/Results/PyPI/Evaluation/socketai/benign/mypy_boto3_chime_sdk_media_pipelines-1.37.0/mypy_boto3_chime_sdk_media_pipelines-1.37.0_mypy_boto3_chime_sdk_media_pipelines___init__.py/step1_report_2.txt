  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the chime-sdk-media-pipelines service, including documentation and client setup.",
  "sources": "Imports the ChimeSDKMediaPipelinesClient class from a local module; reads no external input data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only sets up class references and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future; no other unusual code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily acts as a module interface, importing a client class and assigning it to variables. It includes documentation links and a usage example. No data processing, input handling, or network activity is present. The future date in the copyright might be an anomaly, but it does not pose security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple interface module with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or sensitive actions. The only notable aspect is the future-dated copyright, which is not a security concern.",
