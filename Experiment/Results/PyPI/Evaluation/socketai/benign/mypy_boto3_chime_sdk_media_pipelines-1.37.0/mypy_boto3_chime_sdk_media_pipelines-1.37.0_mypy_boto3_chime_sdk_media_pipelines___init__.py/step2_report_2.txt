  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a straightforward SDK wrapper with no dynamic code, no data processing, and no external inputs.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None detected. The report correctly notes the absence of suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Security risk is 0.1, which seems slightly high given the benign nature. Since there's no actual security concern, lowering it to 0.0 would be more appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent with no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No security issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The only anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is not a security concern.\n- **Errors or flaws?** The report correctly identifies the future date as an anomaly but dismisses it as non-security relevant.\n- **Scores:** Security risk is 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No security concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a simple import and export pattern with no external data handling.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The analysis is accurate.\n- **Scores:** All scores are at 0, matching the benign nature.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a standard SDK interface module.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None detected.\n- **Scores:** All at 0, appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is purely setup and documentation.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** All at 0, fitting the benign assessment.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as expected.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly conservative in some cases (e.g., 0.1 in Report 1). Given the code's simplicity and lack of external data handling, these should be lowered to 0.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 for all, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0, since the code is a benign SDK interface with no security implications.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and cautious, but the minor security risk scores could be reduced to reflect the actual minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign nature.",
