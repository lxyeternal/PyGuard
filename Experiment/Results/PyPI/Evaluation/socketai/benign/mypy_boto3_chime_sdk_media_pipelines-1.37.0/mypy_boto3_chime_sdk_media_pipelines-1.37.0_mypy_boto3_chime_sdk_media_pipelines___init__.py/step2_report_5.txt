  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward SDK wrapper module with no dynamic code, no data processing, and no external inputs. The report correctly identifies no malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 seem reasonable given the minimal code. The small securityRisk score reflects the very low risk, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a simple interface module. The only anomaly noted is the future copyright date (2025).\n- **Security implications:** The future date is not a security concern; it's more of a documentation or metadata issue.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified. The report's securityRisk of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—simple import and export of a client class, no external data or dynamic code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a standard SDK interface module with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others, straightforward setup code with documentation and class aliasing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All are very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is a standard, static SDK interface module.\n- No dynamic code execution, no external data processing, no network activity.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malware.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future copyright date, which does not pose a security risk.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.05 if we want to be extremely cautious about the future date, but it's negligible)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
