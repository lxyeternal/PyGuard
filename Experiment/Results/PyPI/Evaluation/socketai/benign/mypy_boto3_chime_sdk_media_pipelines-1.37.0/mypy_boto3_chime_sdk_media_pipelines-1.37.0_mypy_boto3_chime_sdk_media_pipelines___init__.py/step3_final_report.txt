{
  "purpose": "Provides a simple interface and documentation for the AWS Chime SDK media pipelines client.",
  "sources": "Imports the client class from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import and export only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward. Minor future copyright date (2025) noted but not security relevant.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Python module that imports a client class, assigns it to a variable, and exposes it via __all__. It contains documentation and copyright info. There is no dynamic code, no external data handling, no network activity, and no obfuscation. All signals indicate benign, standard SDK interface code. The minimal security risk score (0.1) in one report is justified but could be lowered to 0, given the lack of any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify this, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk. Minor anomaly (future copyright date) does not impact security. Overall, the code is safe and requires no changes.",
