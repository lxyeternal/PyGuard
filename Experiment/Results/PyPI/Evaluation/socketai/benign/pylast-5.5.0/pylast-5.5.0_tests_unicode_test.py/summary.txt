  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured unit test suite with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are correct, and the security risk score should be set to 0.1 to reflect minimal handling of control characters but overall negligible risk."
