{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a Python client library for Last.fm and Libre.fm APIs, handling data retrieval, response parsing, caching, and request signing for user and music data.",
  "sources": "Network responses from API endpoints, user input parameters, cache storage via shelve.",
  "sinks": "Network requests (HTTP POST), cache storage, XML response parsing, object property assignments.",
  "flows": "User input and parameters flow into request construction; responses flow into XML parsing and data extraction; request signing and caching influence request flow.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no backdoors, no suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard API client for Last.fm/Libre.fm, with proper request signing, error handling, and caching. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or sabotage signs are present. Cryptographic practices and data handling are appropriate. Network interactions are typical for such clients, with no signs of data exfiltration or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure client library with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2), justified by network interactions but without any malicious intent.",
