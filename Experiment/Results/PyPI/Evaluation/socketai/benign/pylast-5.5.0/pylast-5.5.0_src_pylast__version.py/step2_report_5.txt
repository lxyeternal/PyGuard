  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, auto-generated version metadata module.\n- No external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.\n- The code is static, primarily assigning hardcoded version strings and tuples.\n- The use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints is standard practice and does not impact runtime behavior or security.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any sinks, data flows, or external data sources.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign boilerplate for version management.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, generated nature.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is reasonable as there's no security risk.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's purpose and structure.\n- No need to adjust scores or challenge assumptions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n- No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate. The code is standard package metadata, with no security issues.",
