  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward, auto-generated version metadata module for a Python package.\n- It uses static assignment of version strings and tuples.\n- It includes conditional type hints controlled by `TYPE_CHECKING`.\n- No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data sources are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is static, benign, and auto-generated. No issues or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as boilerplate for version info, with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All reports assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Zero is correct. No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  Zero is correct. The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Zero is appropriate. No external data, no code injection, no backdoors.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  The scores given (all zeros for malware, obfuscated, and security risk) are reasonable and should be maintained.\n\n- **Estimate for malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**  \n  Based on the code and reports, I concur that these should all be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, auto-generated version metadata module with no malicious or obfuscated behavior, and no security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to the scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is benign and poses no security threat.",
