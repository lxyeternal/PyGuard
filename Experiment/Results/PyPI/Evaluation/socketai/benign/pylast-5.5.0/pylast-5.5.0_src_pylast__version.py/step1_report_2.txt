  "purpose": "Define version information for the package using setuptools-scm generated data.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples; static definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; only internal variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that defines version-related variables, with no dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data sources. The version information is hardcoded, which is standard for package metadata. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious behavior. No potential attack vectors or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign version definition file with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a static metadata module for the package.",
