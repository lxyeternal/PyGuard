  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; static version data is assigned to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior. The code comments specify it is auto-generated and should not be altered.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version variables for a Python package, using static assignment. It includes type hints conditioned on TYPE_CHECKING for type checking purposes but does not involve any input/output, network, or external data processing. No malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection, are present. The code is straightforward, auto-generated, and intended for version management, with no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, auto-generated version information module with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves solely to define package version metadata and does not perform any external operations or data handling.",
