  "purpose": "Define version information for the package using setuptools-scm conventions.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, no input reading involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external outputs; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code is straightforward and intended for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version metadata for a Python package, using standard practices. It includes type annotations and conditional type checking code, but no dynamic execution or external data input. No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or privacy-invasive code are present. The code is static, focused solely on version info, with no apparent security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration with no malicious behavior. It is standard in Python packaging, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
