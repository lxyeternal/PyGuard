{
  "purpose": "This code defines static version metadata for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, conditional type hint imports controlled by TYPE_CHECKING",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments without data flow from external sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, auto-generated boilerplate code",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated module that assigns version information to variables. It uses conditional type hints, which do not affect runtime behavior. There are no external inputs, no code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The code is typical for package versioning and contains no obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The static nature and lack of external data sources confirm its safety.",
