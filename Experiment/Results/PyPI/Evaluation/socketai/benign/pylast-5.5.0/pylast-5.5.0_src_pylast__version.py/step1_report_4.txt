  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings (__version__ and version_tuple assignments).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no input/output or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static version info assigned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward version metadata assignment with no malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static version information to variables, with some conditional typing logic for type hints. There are no external data inputs, no code execution, and no suspicious operations. The code's purpose is solely to set package version metadata, and it does so securely without any signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only straightforward version metadata assignments with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
