{
  "purpose": "Define version-related metadata for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings (__version__ and version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A - no untrusted data sources or data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional type checking with TYPE_CHECKING; no dynamic code execution, no hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version information using hardcoded strings and tuples. The conditional block for TYPE_CHECKING only influences type hints and does not affect runtime behavior. No external inputs, no data leaks, no code injection, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be boilerplate for version management, generated by setuptools-scm, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign version metadata definition with no malicious behavior or security issues. It is generated by a packaging tool and does not perform any harmful actions.",
