  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify their claims, consistency, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, auto-generated version metadata module.\n- The code uses static strings and tuples to define version info.\n- The only dynamic aspect is the conditional TYPE_CHECKING block, which influences type hints but does not execute at runtime.\n- No external data sources, user input, network activity, or code execution are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: static assignment of version strings and tuples, with a conditional type-checking block.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- The code is standard boilerplate for version management, generated by setuptools-scm.\n\n### Flaws or issues:\n- The reports are accurate; no issues are present in the code.\n- The logic and reasoning in each report are sound.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk:** 0 is appropriate; no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- None are justified; the code is benign.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scoring is appropriate, and there are no inconsistencies or errors in reasoning.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe version metadata module with no security concerns.",
