  "purpose": "Integration tests for the pylast.py library, specifically testing the LibreFM network functionality.",
  "sources": "load_secrets() function retrieves 'username' and 'password_hash' from external secrets source.",
  "targets": "pylast.LibreFMNetwork which uses credentials, and methods that access network or artist data.",
  "flows": "Credentials are loaded and passed to network initialization, then network fetches artist info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of secrets for credentials; no suspicious hardcoded data or obfuscated code; no hidden backdoors or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard integration testing by loading secrets, creating network objects with user credentials, and fetching artist data from the network. It does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands. The use of secrets is expected in testing scenarios. No suspicious anomalies or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard testing code for a music-related API with proper handling of secrets. No malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
