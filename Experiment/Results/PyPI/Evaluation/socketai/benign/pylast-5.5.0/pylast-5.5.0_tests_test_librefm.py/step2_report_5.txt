  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**  \n   All reports consistently indicate that the code is straightforward integration testing code. It loads secrets dynamically via `load_secrets()`, interacts with the `pylast` library to connect to LibreFM, and fetches artist data. No evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity is present. The code's purpose aligns with typical testing scenarios.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   There are no apparent errors or flaws in the code. The logic is clear, and the flow is standard for integration tests: load credentials, instantiate network objects, perform API calls, and verify responses.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** Very low (`0.1` to `0.2`), justified because the code uses external secrets and interacts with external services, but nothing suspicious is evident.\n\n4. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores:**  \n   Since the code is purely for testing and involves external secrets and network calls, the risk is minimal. The only concern could be if secrets are mishandled, but the code loads secrets dynamically and does not hardcode any sensitive data. Therefore, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent, focusing instead on the code's behavior, which appears benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis: all are zero for malware and obfuscated, with very low security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected or suggested.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Very low, justified by the use of external secrets and network interactions typical of integration tests, with no signs of security issues.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of integration tests that interact with an external API using secrets loaded at runtime. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0.1**",
