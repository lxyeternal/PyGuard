      "conclusion": "The dependency contains some patterns associated with malicious behavior, notably eval()/exec() and hardcoded secrets, leading to moderate malware and security risk scores. Obfuscation and dynamic code patterns further elevate suspicion in some reports. However, without explicit malicious payloads, the risk remains moderate. The overall assessment suggests cautious use, with further code review recommended if possible."
