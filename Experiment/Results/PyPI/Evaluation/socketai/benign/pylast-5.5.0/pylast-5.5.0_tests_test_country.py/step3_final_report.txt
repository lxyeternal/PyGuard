  "purpose": "Test suite for pylast.Country class, verifying hashability, string representation, URL generation, and equality.",
  "sources": "Creation of Country instances, method calls like get_country(), get_url(), __str__, __repr__",
  "sinks": "Method outputs such as URL strings, string conversions, equality checks",
  "flows": "Input data (hardcoded country names) to method calls and assertions, internal data flow within the test functions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded test data, no external data or network activity, straightforward assertions",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple test suite with no external input, network requests, or data leaks. It uses standard library methods and performs typical assertions. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The data flow is internal and controlled. Given the absence of external data handling or code injection, the likelihood of malicious behavior is negligible. The URL generation is predictable and based on static inputs. Overall, the code is safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe test suite for the pylast library with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
