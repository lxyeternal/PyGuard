  "flows": "Input sources (user input, environment variables) to sinks via eval(), exec(), network calls, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code in the dependency exhibits patterns such as eval() and exec() which pose security risks, especially if untrusted data is involved. Hardcoded credentials further increase the risk of data leakage or malicious control. Obfuscation and dynamic execution suggest potential malicious intent, but without concrete code snippets, suspicion remains moderate. Benign code shows straightforward logic without suspicious patterns. The presence of obfuscation and risky functions justifies moderate malware and security risk scores, while benign code aligns with low scores. The overall assessment indicates that the dependency warrants caution primarily due to patterns observed in certain reports, especially Report 1 and Report 4.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency contains some patterns associated with malicious behavior, notably eval()/exec() and hardcoded secrets, leading to moderate malware and security risk scores. Obfuscation and dynamic code patterns further elevate suspicion in some reports. However, without explicit malicious payloads, the risk remains moderate. The overall assessment suggests cautious use, with further code review recommended if possible.",
