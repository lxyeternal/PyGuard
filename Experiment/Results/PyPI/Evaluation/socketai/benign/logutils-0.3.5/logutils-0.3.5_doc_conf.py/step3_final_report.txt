  "purpose": "This code is a static configuration file for Sphinx documentation, setting up extensions, paths, project info, and output options.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.path.append, variable assignments for extensions, templates_path, source_suffix, master_doc, project info, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no network calls, code execution, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration; no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static Sphinx configuration script. It contains no dynamic code, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation. The environment variable usage for theme selection is common practice. All variables and imports are standard and do not pose security risks. The code does not process untrusted input or perform any operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriately zero. The high confidence score reflects the straightforward, static nature of the script.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
