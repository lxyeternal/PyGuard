  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script only contains standard configuration code for Sphinx documentation. It imports common modules, sets configuration variables, and appends a path to sys.path. All variables are related to documentation build settings. No user input handling, network connections, or data processing occurs. No code suggests malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
