{
  "purpose": "Provides custom logging handlers and format styles for the Python logging library, including null handlers and flexible format styles.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'logging' module, reads class and function parameters, and accesses record attributes such as getMessage(), exc_info, and message.",
  "sinks": "Format functions generate string outputs; no direct sinks that lead to data leaks or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Record attributes (like getMessage(), exc_info) flow into formatting functions, which produce log output strings; no external data flow to untrusted sources detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code uses standard logging practices and safe string formatting techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various logging style classes and handlers, including NullHandler, different formatting styles (Percent, StrFormat, StringTemplate), and a logger utility function. All functions and classes use standard safe Python operations. No dynamic code execution, external network access, or manipulation of system files is detected. The format classes leverage Python string formatting and templates securely. The hasHandlers function inspects logger hierarchies safely. There are no signs of malicious intent or covert data collection.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard extension to the Python logging library, providing safe and flexible formatting options and a no-op handler for libraries. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present. The code appears well-structured and secure.",
