The minimal security concern noted is typical for logging systems accepting external input and does not constitute malicious behavior."

There is no malicious code or obfuscation present. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of approximately 0.4 is appropriate given the potential for exploitation through malicious configuration inputs."

The minor security concern relates to configuration choices (using HTTPS and secure credentials), not code behavior. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

The malware score is 0, and the obfuscation score is 0. The security risk score should be approximately 0.7, reflecting the significant danger posed by unsafe deserialization in an environment where Redis data could be controlled by an attacker."
