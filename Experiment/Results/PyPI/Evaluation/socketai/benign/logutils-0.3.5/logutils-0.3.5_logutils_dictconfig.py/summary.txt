  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, flexible logging configuration utility that relies on dynamic import and resolution, which inherently carries moderate security risks if used with untrusted configuration data. There is no malicious code or obfuscation present. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of approximately 0.4 is appropriate given the potential for exploitation through malicious configuration inputs."
