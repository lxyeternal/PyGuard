  "purpose": "A logging handler that sends log records to a web server via HTTP or HTTPS, supporting GET and POST methods, with optional Basic Authentication.",
  "sources": "The method emit reads the log record, encodes it, and prepares HTTP request parameters. Credentials are used if provided.",
  "sinks": "The HTTP connection and headers where data is sent; credentials are included in headers if provided.",
  "flows": "Source: mapLogRecord generates data -> emit encodes data and constructs URL -> credentials (if any) are base64-encoded -> data and headers are sent via HTTP/HTTPS connection.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flow. Credentials are handled securely with base64 encoding, but transmitted over network as per configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a remote logging handler. It uses standard libraries, supports secure and insecure channels, and handles credentials with basic auth. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main security concern is transmitting credentials over non-HTTPS if 'secure' is False, which is a configuration issue, not a code flaw. Error handling is broad but typical for such handlers. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard remote logging handler with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor security concern relates to configuration choices (using HTTPS and secure credentials), not code behavior. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
