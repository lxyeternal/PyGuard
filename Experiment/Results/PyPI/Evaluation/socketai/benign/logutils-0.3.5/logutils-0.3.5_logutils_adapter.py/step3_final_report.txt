{
  "purpose": "A logging adapter class that wraps an existing logger to add contextual information and delegate logging calls, facilitating easier and more informative logging.",
  "sources": "The logger object passed during initialization, and the 'extra' dictionary for contextual data.",
  "sinks": "The underlying logger's '_log' method, which outputs logs; no external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "Logging methods (debug, info, warning, error, exception, critical) call 'log', which processes the message and delegates to 'logger._log' with added context.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Usage of 'logutils' appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard logging adapter pattern, adding contextual info via 'extra' and delegating log calls. It relies on trusted logger objects and uses common logging practices. No signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or obfuscation are present. The external 'logutils' utility is used solely for checking handlers, which is typical. The delegation to '_log' assumes the logger is safe, which is standard in controlled environments. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure logging utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and justified based on the code's content.",
