  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'logutils' Python package, configuring metadata, documentation parsing, and test commands.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file, importing 'logutils' module, defining test command that loads tests from local 'tests' directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network transmissions, or external data effects are present.",
  "flows": "Reading README content -> regex extraction -> package setup -> test execution from local files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: reading documentation, defining a test command that runs local unit tests, and configuring package metadata. Regex parsing of README is straightforward, and test execution is typical. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses common practices. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
