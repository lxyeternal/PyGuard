  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are identified across all reports.\n- The code reads a README file, uses regex to extract sections, defines a custom test command that runs unit tests, and sets up package metadata.\n- No external data transmission, network activity, or dynamic code execution is evident.\n- The use of regex and dynamic test loading are typical for such scripts and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code performs standard setup and testing functions without malicious or security-related flaws.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic?**  \n  No. The logic is straightforward, with proper use of Python modules and standard practices.\n\n- **Scores (malware, obfuscated, risk):**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and risk = 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Since there's no malicious behavior, the malware score should remain at 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated code:**  \n  No obfuscation is present; regex parsing is straightforward, and code structure is clear. Score remains 0.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Given the absence of vulnerabilities, backdoors, or data leaks, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Use of sys.exit(1):**  \n  Standard for command-line test scripts; not malicious.\n\n- **Regex parsing README:**  \n  Slightly fragile but common practice; no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.**\n- **Scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and consistent.**\n- **No adjustments needed.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**  \n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.",
