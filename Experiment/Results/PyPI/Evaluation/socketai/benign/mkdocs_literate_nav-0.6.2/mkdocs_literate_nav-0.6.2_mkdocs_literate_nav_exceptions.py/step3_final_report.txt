  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named LiterateNavError inheriting from Exception.",
  "sources": "Class declaration; no input/output, data reads, or external data interactions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a simple class definition with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python custom exception class with no logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent and appropriate. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external dependencies or data flows confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no security issues, malicious intent, or obfuscation. All reports are accurate, and the current scoring reflects the benign nature. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
