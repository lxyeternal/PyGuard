  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the reports and the code:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines a class `LiterateNavError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - No data input/output, no data flow, no logic beyond class declaration.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.\n\n2. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a simple, standard class definition for a custom exception.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no data flows, input/output operations, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The reasoning in each report is sound and consistent.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1.0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - No issues or false positives are apparent.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain vulnerabilities.\n   - The assumption that this is a benign exception class is valid.\n\n5. **Final Assessment:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n   \n   These scores are consistent with the analysis and the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward, benign class definition.\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code content.",
