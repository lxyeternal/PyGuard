  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named LiterateNavError.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code does not read external data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "Simple class definition with no suspicious or unusual behavior; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom exception class inheriting from Exception. It is minimal and straightforward, serving likely as a specific error type for a larger application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard Python class definition for a custom exception with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
