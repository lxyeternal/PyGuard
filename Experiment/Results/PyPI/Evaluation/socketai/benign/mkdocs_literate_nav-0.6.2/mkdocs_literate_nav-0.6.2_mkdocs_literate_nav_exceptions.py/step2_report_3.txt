  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only defines a simple custom exception class (`LiterateNavError`) inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - There are no data input/output operations, no data flows, no external interactions, and no logic beyond class declaration.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified in any report.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment; they correctly identify that this is a benign, straightforward class definition.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are apparent in the reasoning or conclusions.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1.0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious or risky behavior.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree that there is no malicious activity, no security risk, and no obfuscation, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - Any higher score would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - No malicious intent or behavior is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a standard class definition with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (benign, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional Remarks:\nGiven the simplicity of the code, the scores are appropriate. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward, standard Python custom exception class.\n- All reports correctly identify it as benign.\n- No adjustments needed; the scores are justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.",
