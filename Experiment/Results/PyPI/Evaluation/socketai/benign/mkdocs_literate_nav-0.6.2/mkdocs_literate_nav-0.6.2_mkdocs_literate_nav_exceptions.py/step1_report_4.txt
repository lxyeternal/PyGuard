  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named LiterateNavError for error handling.",
  "sources": "The class definition itself does not read input or data; it only declares an exception.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing paths; the code only declares an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple class declaration inheriting from Exception, used for custom error handling. It contains no executable code beyond the class definition. No external data is read, no data is transmitted or leaked, and no suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for defining a custom exception class in Python. There are no malicious behaviors, security issues, or anomalies detected.",
