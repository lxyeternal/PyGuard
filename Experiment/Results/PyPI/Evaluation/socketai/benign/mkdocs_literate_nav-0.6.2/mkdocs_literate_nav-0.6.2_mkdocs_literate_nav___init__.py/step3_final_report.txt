  "purpose": "Assign a benign, standard version string in a Python package.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code only assigns a string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external output present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code is a simple assignment statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and typical for version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line assigning a version string to __version__, a common pattern in Python packages. No inputs, outputs, external calls, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The simplicity and lack of malicious indicators justify these scores. No logical flaws or anomalies are detected. The code poses no security threat and is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version string assignment with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No further action or modification is necessary.",
