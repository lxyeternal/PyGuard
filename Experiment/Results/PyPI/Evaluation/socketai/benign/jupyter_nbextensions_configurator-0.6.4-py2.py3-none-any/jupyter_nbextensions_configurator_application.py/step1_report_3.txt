  "purpose": "Utilities for managing the enabling and disabling of the jupyter_nbextensions_configurator server extension.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, imports from jupyter_contrib_core.notebook_compat, jupyter_nbextensions_configurator, and sys module.",
  "sinks": "Uses sys.exit() to terminate execution based on user input and logs info messages; no data sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are parsed to determine enable/disable actions, which then invoke internal methods to toggle server extension states.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code performs standard extension management functions with proper argument conflict checking.",
  "analysis": "The script defines classes for toggling the jupyter_nbextensions_configurator extension, including argument validation, enabling/disabling actions, and user messaging. It imports standard modules and external Jupyter components without any suspicious code or obfuscated elements. The main function launches the app, handling user commands to modify extension states. There are no network calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors present. All operations are typical for extension management within Jupyter.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate extension management utilities for Jupyter Notebook, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard tasks such as argument parsing, extension toggling, and user messaging without any suspicious or malicious code behavior.",
