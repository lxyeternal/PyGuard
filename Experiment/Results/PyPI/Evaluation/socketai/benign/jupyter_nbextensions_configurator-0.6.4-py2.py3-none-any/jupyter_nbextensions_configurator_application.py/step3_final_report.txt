  "purpose": "Utilities for managing the jupyter_nbextensions_configurator extension, including enabling and disabling it via command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, imported modules (`sys`, `copy`, `jupyter_contrib_core.notebook_compat`, `jupyter_nbextensions_configurator`), and internal configuration flags.",
  "sinks": "Calls to `sys.exit()`, logging outputs, and extension state toggling functions (`_set_nbextension_state`).",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments → conflict detection → extension toggling functions → process termination or logging.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity. Uses standard patterns for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The code manages extension toggling with argument parsing, conflict checks, and state setting via trusted APIs. It uses `sys.exit()` for process termination, which is typical for CLI utilities. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The logic is straightforward, relying on external modules that are standard in the Jupyter ecosystem. The security implications are minimal, as the code performs expected extension management tasks without exposing vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for enabling/disabling a Jupyter extension. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1-0.2) are accurate and justified.",
