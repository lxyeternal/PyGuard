  "purpose": "Utilities for installing, enabling, and disabling the jupyter_nbextensions_configurator server extension for Jupyter notebooks.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments, imports configuration modules, and accesses system functions such as sys.exit() and sys.version.",
  "targets": "The code executes system exit commands and logs info; it does not perform network actions or access untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> parse_command_line method -> possibly raise ArgumentConflict or call super().parse_command_line() -> start() method -> sys.exit() or toggle extension states -> logs info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code primarily manages extension states with no malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to control Jupyter nbextensions configurator extensions, involving command-line argument parsing, configuration toggling, and process termination. It uses safe, standard library functions and well-known Jupyter APIs. No network activity, file modifications, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code structure is straightforward and focused on extension management, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. All imported modules are from legitimate sources, and there are no indicators of malware or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing Jupyter notebook extensions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It adheres to standard practices for extension control and command-line processing.",
