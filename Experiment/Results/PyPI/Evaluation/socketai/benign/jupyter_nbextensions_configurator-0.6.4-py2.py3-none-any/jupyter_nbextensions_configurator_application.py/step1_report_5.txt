  "purpose": "Utilities for installing, enabling, and disabling the jupyter_nbextensions_configurator server extension within Jupyter Notebook environments.",
  "sources": "Import statements (e.g., sys, copy, jupyter_contrib_core.notebook_compat, jupyter_nbextensions_configurator.__version__); method parameters (argv); class attributes and properties; user input via command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit() calls (exiting the program); calls to toggle server extension states; logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument parsing from argv to conflict checking; toggle flags and properties influencing extension state; start method triggering extension enable/disable; sys.exit() invoked if no subcommand provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or malicious obfuscation techniques; no network connections or data exfiltration observed; no suspicious data leaks or backdoors; reliance on external modules that are commonly used for extension management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for managing the enablement and disablement of the jupyter_nbextensions_configurator server extension in Jupyter Notebook. It processes command-line arguments to prevent conflicting options and toggles extension states accordingly. The logic involves standard extension management operations, logging, and program flow control via sys.exit(). There are no indications of malicious code, such as network connections, data theft, or backdoors. The external dependencies are typical for Jupyter extension management. The overall code functions as intended for extension toggling without any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility code for managing Jupyter Notebook extensions. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this module. It relies on standard practices and external Jupyter modules for extension management, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
