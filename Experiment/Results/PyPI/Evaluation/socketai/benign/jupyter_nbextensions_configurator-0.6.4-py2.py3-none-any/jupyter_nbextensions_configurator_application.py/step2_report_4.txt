  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility for toggling the extension, with command-line parsing, conflict checking, and extension state management.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. The use of sys.exit and logging is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. The low risk score (0.2) is reasonable, given that it is a utility script. The malware score is correctly 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility for installing/managing the extension, with command-line arguments and extension toggling.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no secrets, standard modules, straightforward logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis is appropriate. The code performs extension management without any suspicious behavior. The risk score is very low, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility for enabling/disabling the extension, with argument parsing and extension toggling.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no malicious code, standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The code is typical for such utilities, with no malicious indicators. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Extension management via command-line, with argument validation and toggling.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no secrets, standard functions, safe external modules.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis correctly identifies the code as benign. The risk score of zero aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar extension management utility, with argument parsing and extension toggling.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity, standard modules.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The low risk score is justified given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code in all reports is consistent with standard extension management scripts. No malicious code, no backdoors, no data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n- **Score Justifications:** The malware scores are all correctly 0, as no malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the code clarity. The risk scores are low, reflecting minimal security concern, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's benign nature, a maximum of 0.2 is reasonable, but most reports already assign 0 or 0.1, which is acceptable.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and well-reasoned. No changes needed. The code is safe, and the security risk is minimal.",
