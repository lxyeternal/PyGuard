  "purpose": "Utilities for toggling the jupyter_nbextensions_configurator server extension, including enabling and disabling via command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Configuration flags, command-line arguments, and imports from jupyter_contrib_core.notebook_compat and jupyter_nbextensions_configurator modules.",
  "machines": "sys.exit calls, logging functions, and functions that change extension states (e.g., _set_nbextension_state).",
  "flows": "User provides command-line arguments -> parse_command_line checks for conflicts -> start() toggles extension states -> sys.exit terminates program execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.exit in start() and main(), which could terminate processes prematurely; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns observed; reliance on external modules without validation; straightforward command-line processing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for enabling/disabling a Jupyter extension, with command-line parsing and extension state management. It uses standard Python modules, safe class inheritance, and controlled extension state toggling. No code injections, dynamic execution, or data leaks are evident. The sys.exit calls are part of normal command-line behavior. External module functions appear standard and safe. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical command-line utility for managing Jupyter extensions, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs extension toggling securely and transparently, relying on existing, trusted modules. Overall security risk is minimal.",
