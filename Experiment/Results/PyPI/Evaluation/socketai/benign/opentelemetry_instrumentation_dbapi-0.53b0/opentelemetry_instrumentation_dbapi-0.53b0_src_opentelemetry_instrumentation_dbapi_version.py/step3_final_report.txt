  "purpose": "This code serves as a header for an open-source Python package, providing licensing information, versioning, and initializing an empty instruments list.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only assigns a version string and initializes a variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static with no dynamic data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard license comments, version assignment, and variable initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static header with no functions, data processing, or external interactions. It contains only licensing comments, a version string, and an empty tuple initialization. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is typical for open-source project headers and contains no security risks. The provided reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code does not exhibit any anomalies or suspicious activity, and the scores are appropriate given its simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a standard header with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
