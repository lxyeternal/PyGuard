{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set a version identifier and initialize an empty tuple, likely for use in a larger open-source project related to OpenTelemetry instrumentation.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the hardcoded string for version (__version__) and the empty tuple assignment (_instruments).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in this code; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink as the code is solely variable assignments and comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements are present. The license comments are standard and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains licensing comments, a version string, and an initialization of an empty tuple. No input, output, or dynamic code execution is present. The code snippet is minimal and straightforward, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, primarily containing license information, a version identifier, and a variable initialization. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security issues.",
