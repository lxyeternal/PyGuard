  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for data processing and possibly interacting with external systems, but no specific malicious intent is immediately evident from the provided fragment.",
  "sources": "Reads data from standard input, environment variables, and external libraries or modules.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via print statements and potentially writes to files or network (not explicitly shown).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources or environment variables through processing functions, potentially reaching output or storage points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features present. No malicious network calls or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of standard data processing operations. It imports common libraries, reads inputs, and performs calculations or transformations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, malicious network communication, or system sabotage are visible. The structure and syntax are typical of legitimate Python scripts, with no evidence of obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review of this code fragment, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be benign, fulfilling its apparent purpose of data handling or processing.",
