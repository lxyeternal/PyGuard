  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license comment and an assignment of an empty tuple to _instruments. There are no dynamic operations, input reading, data processing, or external communications. The license comments indicate open-source licensing but do not influence security. The code is minimal and standard, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
