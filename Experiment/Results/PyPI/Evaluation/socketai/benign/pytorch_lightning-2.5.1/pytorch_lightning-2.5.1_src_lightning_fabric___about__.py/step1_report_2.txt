  "purpose": "Define module metadata including author, contact, license, copyright, and documentation URLs.",
  "sources": "time.strftime('%Y') for dynamic year in copyright string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; purely metadata assignment.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of time.strftime to dynamically generate the current year is standard; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'time' module and assigns several module-level variables containing metadata. The only dynamic element is the current year obtained via time.strftime('%Y'). All other variables are static strings. No input/output, no code execution, and no sensitive data handling are present. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely metadata with no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard module header or metadata declaration.",
