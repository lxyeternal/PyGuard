  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the original code provided.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified; the reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** All scores (malware, obfuscated, risk) are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the original; no issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Correctly identifies that the code is metadata-only.\n- **Scores:** All scores are 0, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Matches the original code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Correctly states that the code is metadata with dynamic year insertion.\n- **Scores:** All zero, fitting the benign description.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same code, no issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Accurate analysis.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same code, no issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Correctly notes that only the current year is dynamically generated.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since there's no security concern or vulnerability.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No modifications to scores or analysis are necessary.\n- The code is a standard metadata declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided analyses and the code's nature.",
