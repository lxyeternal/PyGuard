{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata including author, contact, license, and URLs, with dynamic current year.",
  "sources": "time.strftime('%Y') used to generate current year for __copyright__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input processed; no data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "Metadata variables assigned statically; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Use of time.strftime('%Y') is standard; no suspicious or unusual code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports the time module and declares several module-level metadata variables, with the only dynamic element being the current year fetched via time.strftime('%Y'). There are no input/output operations, no network activity, no data processing, and no obfuscation. The code serves purely as package metadata, which is a common and safe pattern. All reports correctly identify this as benign, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The use of time.strftime('%Y') is standard practice and does not introduce any security concerns. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward metadata declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe, standard, and poses no security risks.",
