  "purpose": "Define package metadata for a Python project related to Lightning AI.",
  "sources": "Reading metadata variables, timestamp for copyright year.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only sets static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of time.strftime() in a metadata string, which is benign; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'time' module and assigns various metadata attributes such as author, email, license, copyright, homepage, and docs URL. The only dynamic element is the copyright string that uses 'time.strftime' to insert the current year. All other variables are static strings. No user input, network calls, or sensitive data handling is present. No obfuscation or malicious code observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward package metadata without any malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to set descriptive information about the package.",
