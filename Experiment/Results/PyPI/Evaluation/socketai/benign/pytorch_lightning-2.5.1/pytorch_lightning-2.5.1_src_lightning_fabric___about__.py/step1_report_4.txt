  "purpose": "Define metadata and module information for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "time.strftime('%Y') used to generate current year for copyright statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The current year from time.strftime flows into the __copyright__ string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of time.strftime() to dynamically generate current year; no suspicious behavior but indicates dynamic content generation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets module-level metadata attributes such as author, email, license, copyright, homepage, documentation URLs, and exports. It uses the standard 'time' module to get the current year for the copyright statement. No input or output of untrusted data, no external network interactions, no code execution beyond standard library calls. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard metadata declaration for a Python module, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and intended for documentation or package distribution purposes.",
