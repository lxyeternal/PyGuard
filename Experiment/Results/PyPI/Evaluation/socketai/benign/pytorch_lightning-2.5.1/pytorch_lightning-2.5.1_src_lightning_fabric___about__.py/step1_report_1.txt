{
  "purpose": "Define module metadata such as author, email, license, copyright, URLs, and list of exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of strings and the call to time.strftime('%Y') for dynamic year.",
  "sinks": "None that process untrusted data or lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted input to sensitive operations or external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of time.strftime('%Y') is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares metadata variables and imports the time module. The only dynamic aspect is fetching the current year for the copyright statement, which is safe and standard. There are no input sources, data processing, or external network operations. The code's structure and content appear typical for package metadata and contain no malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to define module metadata with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
