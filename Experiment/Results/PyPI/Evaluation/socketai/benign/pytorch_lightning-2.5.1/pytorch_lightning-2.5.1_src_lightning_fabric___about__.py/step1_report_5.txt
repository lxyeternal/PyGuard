  "purpose": "Define package metadata and documentation details for a Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current year using time.strftime('%Y') to generate the copyright string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs are used in the code, and no sensitive information is transmitted or stored.",
  "flows": "The only flow is reading the current year from the system time to construct the copyright string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or unusual code patterns. The use of time.strftime for dynamic copyright info is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets module-level metadata variables. It dynamically generates the copyright year using the current system year. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no code execution, no network operations, and no obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign module metadata declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
