{
  "purpose": "The code reads a version string from a file named 'version.info' within the package directory structure.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'version.info' file from disk based on the script's location.",
  "sinks": "File read operation; no direct untrusted data sink present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Determines file path based on script location -> opens and reads the first line of 'version.info' -> strips whitespace.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic. The code performs standard file handling.",
  "analysis": "The code computes the path to 'version.info' based on the script's directory, then reads the first line to get the version. It includes a fallback to another directory if the initial path doesn't exist, which appears to be a normal setup for version management. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected, and no external data or untrusted input handling that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, performs standard file operations, and contains no malicious intent. It securely reads version information from a file without any evident security concerns.",
