  "purpose": "Read the package version information from a file located relative to the current script's directory.",
  "sources": "Reading the existence of a file and opening it to read its first line.",
  "sinks": "File reading operation; no untrusted data is directly written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "File existence check -> Open file and read first line -> assign to variable.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code dynamically constructs a file path based on the script's location, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the directory of the current script (__file__), constructs a path to 'version.info' in the parent directory. If this file does not exist, it adjusts the path to look in the current package directory. It then opens this file with utf-8 encoding and reads its first line, stripping whitespace, assigning it to 'version'. No external or untrusted input influences the file path at runtime, nor is there any data being transmitted or executed. The logic appears straightforward and consistent with version file handling, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code securely reads version information from a file relative to the script location, with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a standard pattern for version management.",
