  "purpose": "Read version information from a file within the package directory.",
  "sources": "Reading from the file system: os.path.exists, open.",
  "targets": "The version variable stores the first line of the version.info file, which could potentially be used elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check (exists) and reading file contents (open) to assign to version.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code detected. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the package root directory using __file__, constructs a path to version.info, checks if it exists, and if not, defaults to a different path. It then opens and reads the first line to get the version. This is a standard pattern for loading version info from a file. No external network activity, no obfuscated code, no malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical version file read operation with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is a standard implementation for managing version info.",
