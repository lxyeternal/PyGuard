{
  "purpose": "The code loads a version string from a 'version.info' file located relative to the current script's directory.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'version.info' file using open() after constructing its path based on the script's location.",
  "sinks": "The read line is stored in the variable 'version'; no direct untrusted data sinks or external data transmission present.",
  "flows": "File path is constructed from script location; data read from file assigned to 'version' variable; no further data flow or output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic execution or obfuscation detected. The code relies solely on filesystem paths and reading a file.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the path to 'version.info' based on the script's directory structure, first trying a parent directory, then defaulting to the current directory if not found. It reads the first line of the file, presumably containing version info. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or sensitive data handling. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple and safe operation of reading version information from a file. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malicious data exfiltration, or security risks. It appears to be a standard practice for loading version info in a Python package.",
