  "purpose": "Read the package version information from a file located relative to the current script.",
  "sources": "Reading the file path from the filesystem using os.path and opening the version.info file.",
  "sinks": "Reading the content of version.info into a variable; no untrusted data flows or external output.",
  "flows": "File path determination -> Opening and reading file contents into a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no dynamic execution or suspicious code patterns; straightforward file read operation.",
  "analysis": "The code calculates the path to a version information file, checks its existence, and reads the first line of the file into a variable. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The file path logic is standard for package versioning. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple and safe implementation to read version info from a file. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
