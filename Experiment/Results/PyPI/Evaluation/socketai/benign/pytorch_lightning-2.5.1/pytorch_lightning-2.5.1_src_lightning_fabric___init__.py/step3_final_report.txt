{
  "purpose": "Initialize package environment, perform conditional imports, set environment variables for library behavior, configure logging, and patch modules for the 'lightning_fabric' package.",
  "sources": "File existence checks (__about__.py, __version__.py), environment variables (PYTORCH_NVML_BASED_CUDA_CHECK, USE_LIBUV, POSSIBLE_USER_WARNINGS), module imports from lightning_fabric, and the last import of lightning_fabric._graveyard.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables influencing underlying library behavior, import statements affecting module setup, and the final patching import; no untrusted data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "File existence checks determine conditional imports; environment variables are set and read to influence behavior; imports from lightning_fabric modules are executed; the last import applies patches to modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard environment variable usage, conditional imports, and module patching are typical in such frameworks; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package initialization: setting environment variables for CUDA and warning behavior, conditional imports based on file presence and package availability, logging configuration, and module patching. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. Environment variables are used for documented, benign purposes. The import of '_graveyard' is a common patching step. All signals indicate typical, safe setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard initialization script for the 'lightning_fabric' package, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. Environment variable manipulations are documented and typical for such frameworks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
