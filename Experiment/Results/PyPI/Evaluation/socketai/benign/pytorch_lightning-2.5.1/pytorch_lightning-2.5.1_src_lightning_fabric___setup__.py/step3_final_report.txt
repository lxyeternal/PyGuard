{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically loads modules for package setup, reads requirements files, and assembles metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "External requirement files, environment variables, and specific module files (assistant.py, __about__.py, __version__.py).",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically loaded modules, reading environment variables that influence behavior.",
  "flows": "Source files (requirements, module files) are loaded into memory and executed; environment variables influence configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert' statements for critical steps, reliance on external files without validation, dynamic code execution via 'exec_module'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks with dynamic module loading, which is common but can be risky if files are compromised. No network activity or malicious payloads are present. The use of environment variables and external files introduces potential attack vectors if files are tampered with. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. The main concern is ensuring the integrity of external files and replacing assertions with proper error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with no malicious intent. Its main security consideration is the trustworthiness of external files and environment variables. Proper validation and integrity checks are recommended but not currently implemented. Overall, the code is safe for use in a trusted environment.",
