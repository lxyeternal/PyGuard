  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script manages package setup, with no signs of malicious activity. It uses dynamic module loading (`_load_py_module`) for internal modules, reads environment variables, and manipulates manifest files as part of the build process. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are detected.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis. No malicious behavior observed.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and standard for setup scripts.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, considering the script's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on dynamic module loading from files, environment variables, and manifest handling. It notes that dynamic loading could be risky if files are compromised but considers the context controlled.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the lack of malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code clarity maintained.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, given the controlled environment.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights potential risks with dynamic module loading (`spec_from_file_location` and `exec_module`), noting that malicious code could be executed if source files are compromised. It mentions that no network activity or backdoors are evident but recognizes the inherent risk.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malware; the dynamic loading is standard but risky if files are malicious.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.4 — slightly higher due to potential risks associated with dynamic code execution, but still low overall.\n\n**Verdict:** The score seems reasonable. The concern about dynamic module loading is valid but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with focus on standard setup procedures, dynamic module loading, and manifest management. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, consistent with the script's purpose.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, describes a standard setup script with dynamic module loading and manifest handling. Notes potential risks if external files are compromised but finds no malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, given the controlled environment.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring aligns with the findings.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis. No signs of malicious activity, network calls, or backdoors are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Ranging from 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting minor concerns mainly around dynamic module loading, which is standard in build scripts but could be risky if source files are compromised.\n\n### **My Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and understandable.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — considering the dynamic code execution, but within acceptable bounds for a controlled build environment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured setup script with no malicious intent. The dynamic module loading introduces some risk if external files are compromised, but this is typical in such scripts and does not indicate malicious behavior.\n\n**Final recommendations:** Maintain the current scores. No changes necessary.",
