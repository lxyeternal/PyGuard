  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured setup utility with no evidence of malicious intent. The dynamic code execution introduces some inherent risk, but it is typical for such build scripts and does not indicate malicious behavior. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low to moderate risk score (~0.2-0.4) are justified and consistent with the analysis."
