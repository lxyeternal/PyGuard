  "purpose": "Configuration parser and environment setup for Lightning Fabric, handling environment variables, user arguments, and component instantiation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user arguments, imported registry data, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, network activity, or system modifications; primarily configuration validation and object creation.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables and user inputs, validates them, and instantiates components accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; standard validation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection, validation, and component instantiation typical of framework setup. It does not execute untrusted commands, perform network operations, or modify system files. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. Validation is thorough, and environment variables influence configuration as expected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent configuration and environment setup module with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The low security risk score is justified, and the code poses negligible supply chain threat.",
