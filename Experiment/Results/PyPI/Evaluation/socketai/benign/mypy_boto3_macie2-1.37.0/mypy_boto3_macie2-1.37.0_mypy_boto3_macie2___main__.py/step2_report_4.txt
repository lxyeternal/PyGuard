  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI script that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It reads `sys.argv` to check for `--version`.\n   - It writes static information to `stdout`.\n   - No external network calls, file operations, environment variable manipulations, or cryptographic functions are present.\n   - No obfuscation, code injection, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n   - The code is simple, clean, and intended solely for informational purposes.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity**:\n   - All reports uniformly agree that the script is benign, with no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risks.\n   - They correctly identify that the script only interacts with command-line arguments and standard output, with no external or sensitive data involved.\n   - The analysis in each report is consistent and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0.0, which is correct since there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0.0, which is justified due to the absence of vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n   \n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No reason to increase any scores based on the provided code.\n   - The code's purpose is purely informational, with no hidden or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation**:\n   - The code is safe, benign, and free of vulnerabilities.\n   - The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1.0), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at **0.0**.\n- No changes are necessary; the reports are accurate.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0.0\n- **Risk score**: 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
