  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   - The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.  \n   - All reports confirm no suspicious behaviors, no external network calls, no data leaks, no obfuscation, and no malicious code.  \n   - **Conclusion:** The code appears benign, with no issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is safe, straightforward, and only outputs static information.  \n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.  \n   - **Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   - All reports assign `malware: 0.0`, `obfuscated: 0.0`, and `securityRisk: 0.0`.  \n   - These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.  \n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0.0, which is appropriate.  \n   - No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n   - All reports correctly identify malware score as 0.0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score is accurate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they analyze the code accurately.  \n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis, all indicating benign, non-malicious code.\n\n**Final Assessment and Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a simple CLI utility that displays static package info and version. All evidence points to it being benign, with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reports and the code review.",
