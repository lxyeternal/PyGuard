{
  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the boto3 Macie2 package, including version info and documentation links.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (for command-line arguments), sys.stdout (for output messages)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (for printing info), sys.argv (for input detection)",
  "flows": "Command-line input (argv) influences whether print_version() or print_info() is called; outputs are written to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only outputs static informational strings",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple CLI utility functions that print static information about a package. No external input is processed beyond checking for '--version' argument. There is no code injection, network activity, or use of sensitive data. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present. All code flows are predictable and only involve printing static data.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign CLI utility script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply outputs static package information based on command-line arguments.",
