  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the package, including version and documentation links.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output, sys.argv for input command-line args",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) influences which information (print_version or print_info) is output to sys.stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; straightforward functionality",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs package info or version based on command-line args. It imports only sys, performs standard checks, and prints static information. No untrusted input handling beyond command-line args, and no data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a CLI informational tool with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
