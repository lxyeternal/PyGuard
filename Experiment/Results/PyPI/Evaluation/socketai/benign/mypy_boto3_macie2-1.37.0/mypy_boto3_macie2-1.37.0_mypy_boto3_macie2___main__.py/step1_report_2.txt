{
  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package providing information about boto3 Macie2 stub types and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv, reads standard output functions, and metadata comments.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check flows into printing version or info; output flows to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The comments and structure are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script functions solely as a command-line interface to display package information or version number. It reads from sys.argv for arguments and writes static information to stdout. There are no inputs from untrusted sources beyond command-line arguments, and the output is static or based on these arguments. No external network connections, file operations, or data manipulations occur. The code is simple, well-structured, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI script used for informational purposes. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior.",
