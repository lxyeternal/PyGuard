  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) to determine output; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to `sys.stdout`; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (`--version`) leads to printing version info; otherwise, prints package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI script that outputs predefined static information. It reads command-line arguments to decide whether to print version info or package details. It writes output directly to stdout. There are no external network calls, file operations, environment variable reads, or cryptographic functions. The code is clear, simple, and free of obfuscation or malicious payloads. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, reflecting the benign and static nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk features. The provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications to the scores or further analysis are necessary.",
