  "purpose": "Provides CLI commands to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments; sys.stdout for output.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout for printing info and version; sys.argv for input detection.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) determines whether to call print_version or print_info, which then write output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code is straightforward and standard for CLI entry points.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and defines three functions: print_info, print_version, and main. The print_info function outputs static package metadata, and print_version outputs the static version string. The main function checks for '--version' argument and calls the appropriate function. The code only interacts with standard input/output streams and relies on static strings. There are no suspicious behaviors, no data leaks, and no external network activity or cryptographic operations. It appears to be a typical CLI interface with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple CLI entry point that outputs package information and version. It contains no malicious code, no data leaks, and no suspicious behaviors. It is safe and standard for a CLI tool.",
