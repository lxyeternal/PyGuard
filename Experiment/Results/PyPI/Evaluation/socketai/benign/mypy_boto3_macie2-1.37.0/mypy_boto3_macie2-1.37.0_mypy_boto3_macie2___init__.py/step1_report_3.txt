{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for the AWS Macie2 service, primarily for importing and exposing relevant classes and functions for client interaction and pagination.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter) and inline documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code primarily defines imports and re-exports for a client library.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process data or user inputs, but only organizes imports and exposes them.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a large block of commented documentation, but no unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as an import hub for AWS Macie2 service components, with clear separation of concerns via modules. The inline documentation appears to be sample usage instructions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leaks, code injection, or backdoors. The structure and content are consistent with standard SDK setup files. No external data sources or sensitive data handling are present. The imports and re-exports are typical for a client SDK setup, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK module setup for AWS Macie2, containing no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not contain hardcoded credentials or malicious behavior. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
