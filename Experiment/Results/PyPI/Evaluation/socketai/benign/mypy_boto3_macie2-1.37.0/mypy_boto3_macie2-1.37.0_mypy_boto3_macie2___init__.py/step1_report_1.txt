{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports a Python module for interacting with the AWS Macie2 service, providing access to various paginators, a client class, and a waiter.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter) and the module's own code defining exports and constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no typical security sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions; the code primarily sets up class and function references.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only establishes references to classes and functions for later use.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is standard for a SDK interface definition.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports classes and functions from internal modules, defines a client alias, and declares an __all__ list for module exports. It contains no user input handling, no network or system commands, no code execution, and no hardcoded secrets or credentials. All imported components are typical for a SDK wrapper, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a clean, standard Python module for AWS Macie2 SDK access. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. It appears to be a benign SDK interface setup.",
