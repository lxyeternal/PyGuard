{
  "purpose": "Provides a main interface and re-exports for the macie2 service client, including paginators and waiters for AWS Macie2.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter) and the module's own code for defining the API surface.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or outputs identified.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from external sources to sinks is detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code is straightforward and primarily re-exports modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions from local modules and exposes them via __all__, setting up a package interface for the macie2 service. No runtime data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be standard library/package setup code, focusing on interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup for the AWS Macie2 service, acting as an organized interface with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
