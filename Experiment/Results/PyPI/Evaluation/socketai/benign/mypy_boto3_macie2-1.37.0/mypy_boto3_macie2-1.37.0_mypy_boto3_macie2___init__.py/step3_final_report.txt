{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python module interface for AWS Macie2 SDK, importing and re-exporting classes, functions, and waiters for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter) and inline documentation for usage.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; static imports and aliasing only.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; setup code with no dynamic or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface module, importing classes and functions, defining an alias, and exposing them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code execution, data handling from untrusted sources, or network activity beyond SDK calls. Documentation is standard usage example. No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The structure is typical for a Python SDK wrapper, with clear, static imports and exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface setup with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. All signals and reports correctly assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, consistent with the code's nature.",
