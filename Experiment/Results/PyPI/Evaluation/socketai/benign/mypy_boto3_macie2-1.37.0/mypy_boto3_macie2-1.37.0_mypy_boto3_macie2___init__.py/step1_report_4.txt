{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface to the Amazon Macie2 service, importing relevant classes and creating an alias for the client.",
  "sources": "Reads input data primarily from external package imports and environment variables for configuration (e.g., AWS credentials).",
  "sinks": "Uses the imported classes and functions to interact with AWS services; no direct data sinks or untrusted data handling evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules to the client object, then to paginators and waiters for AWS API interactions. No external or untrusted data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code consists mainly of imports and straightforward assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions from local modules, creates a client alias, and defines an __all__ list for module exports. There are no dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or suspicious behaviors. The code functions as a straightforward interface wrapper around the AWS Macie2 SDK components.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign interface module for AWS Macie2 SDK, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It primarily facilitates access to AWS APIs via imported classes and does not handle untrusted input directly.",
