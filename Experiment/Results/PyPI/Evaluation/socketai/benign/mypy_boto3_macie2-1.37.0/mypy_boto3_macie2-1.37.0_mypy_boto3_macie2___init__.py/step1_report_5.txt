{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface and import structure for the AWS Macie2 service, enabling users to interact with various paginators, waiters, and the client object for AWS Macie2 API calls.",
  "sources": "The code reads static import definitions and the module's own class and function definitions; no external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data or user input are processed or sent; the code solely imports and exports classes and functions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs; the code is a static module with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are detected. The code strictly imports classes and functions, with no dynamic execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, defining a client alias, and exporting constants for the package's API. It adheres to standard module structure, importing necessary components from internal submodules. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. All elements are static, well-organized, and typical for SDK or API wrapper modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup for AWS Macie2, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It merely imports and re-exports components for API interaction, following standard patterns.",
