  "purpose": "Defines the version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ variable from a hardcoded string.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are involved.",
  "flows": "None; static assignment of version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward version assignment with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a copyright comment and a simple assignment of a version string to __version__. There are no input sources, no sinks, no data flows, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or other suspicious activities. The version string appears standard. The comment incorrectly states the copyright year as 2025, which is in the future, but this is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious. Overall, the code is minimal and standard for version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues.",
