  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__` with a copyright comment.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or external interactions.\n   - The code is static and minimal, typical for version declaration files.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n   - The only minor note is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future and possibly a typo or placeholder, but this is not malicious.\n\n3. **Scores Given & Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - All scores are zero for malware and security risk, aligning with the code's simplicity.\n   - No reason to elevate scores since there's no suspicious activity, malicious code, or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No questionable assumptions are present; all assessments are cautious and accurate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The only minor anomaly is the future year in the copyright comment (\"2025\"). While unusual, this is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- The code's purpose is purely metadata, which inherently carries no security risk.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a simple, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n- Confirm that the scores accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores: 0**",
