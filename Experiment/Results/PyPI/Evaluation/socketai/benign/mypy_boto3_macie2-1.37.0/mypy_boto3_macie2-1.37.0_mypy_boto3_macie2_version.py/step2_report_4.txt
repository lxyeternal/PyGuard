  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string (`__version__ = \"1.37.0\"`) with a copyright comment.\n   - No dynamic code, input/output handling, or external data flows are present.\n   - No suspicious or malicious code constructs are detected.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and contains no issues.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as a standard version declaration.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - Minor note: The copyright year \"2025\" is in the future, which might be a typo or placeholder, but it doesn't indicate malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`, and `confidence=1`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all zero, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n   - If any were higher, justification would be needed, but in this case, none are.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign `malware=0`, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No questionable assumptions are made; the reports are cautious and accurate.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n\n**Final Expert Judgment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nThe code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Note:** Given the simplicity and benign nature, I agree with the current scores. If I were to assign my own estimates, I would keep all scores at zero, reflecting the absence of any security concern.",
