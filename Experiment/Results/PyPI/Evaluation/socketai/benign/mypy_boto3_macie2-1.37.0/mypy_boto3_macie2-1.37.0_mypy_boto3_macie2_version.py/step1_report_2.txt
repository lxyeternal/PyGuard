  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright notice with a future year (2025) but no other suspicious activity; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a string variable __version__ with a version number and includes a copyright comment. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. The version number is static, and the comment does not affect runtime behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues.",
