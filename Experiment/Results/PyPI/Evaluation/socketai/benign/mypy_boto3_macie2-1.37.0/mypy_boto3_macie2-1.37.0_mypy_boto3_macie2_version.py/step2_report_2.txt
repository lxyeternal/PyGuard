  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__` with a copyright comment.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic behaviors, or external interactions.\n   - No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious intent.\n   - The only minor note is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future and possibly a typo or placeholder, but this is not malicious.\n\n3. **Scores Review:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any risk that warrants a score above 0.5.\n   - The code is a standard version declaration, common in open-source projects, with no malicious or risky elements.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify no malware.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's actual behavior.\n   - The only questionable point is the future year in the copyright comment, but that is not a security concern.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThis code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no malicious or security issues. The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n---\n\n### My Personal Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the code's benign nature.",
