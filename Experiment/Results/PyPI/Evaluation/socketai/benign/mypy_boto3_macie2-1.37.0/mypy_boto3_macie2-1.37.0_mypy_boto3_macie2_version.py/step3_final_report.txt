  "purpose": "Declare the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string to __version__, comment block with copyright info.",
  "sinks": "None; static assignment with no external data or untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future year '2025' in the comment, which is likely a typo or placeholder but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static declaration of a version string with a copyright comment. No dynamic code, input/output, network activity, or external dependencies are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The only minor anomaly is the future year '2025' in the comment, which does not indicate malicious intent. The assigned scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version declaration file with no security risks or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
