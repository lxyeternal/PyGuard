  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-macie2', intended to facilitate package installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file from the current directory for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "Reads local file for long description, then uses setuptools.setup() to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs detected. The license statement is standard; no suspicious comments or code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup operation, importing Path for file reading and setuptools for package configuration. It reads a local markdown file to include as long description, then calls setup() with standard package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and URLs. All elements are typical for a Python package setup script. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup file with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs normal package configuration tasks without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
