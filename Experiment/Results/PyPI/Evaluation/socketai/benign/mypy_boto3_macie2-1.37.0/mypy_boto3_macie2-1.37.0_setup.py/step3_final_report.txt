  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-macie2 package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata defined in setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration, code injection, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md as input; static data used in setup configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools, performing static configuration tasks. It reads a local markdown file and calls setup() with fixed metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No dynamic or malicious operations are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and follows common packaging practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup configuration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and are appropriate.",
