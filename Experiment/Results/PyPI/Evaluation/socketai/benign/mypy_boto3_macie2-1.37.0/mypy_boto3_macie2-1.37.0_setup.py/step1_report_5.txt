{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to configure and set up a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-macie2' for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for the long description; static assignment of package metadata; imports from standard library and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or code execution points; no untrusted data handling or network connections.",
  "flows": "Reads the README.md file content to assign to LONG_DESCRIPTION, then passes all package metadata to setup() without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden behaviors, or obfuscated constructs detected. The script performs standard setup tasks with no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and setuptools, reads a markdown file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata. There are no indications of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or external communications. The code follows typical Python packaging conventions and contains no anomalies or obfuscated constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be a legitimate configuration for distributing a type stub package.",
