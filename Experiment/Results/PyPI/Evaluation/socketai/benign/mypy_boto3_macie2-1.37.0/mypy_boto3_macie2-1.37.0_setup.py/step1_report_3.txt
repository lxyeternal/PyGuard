{
  "purpose": "This setup script is for packaging and distributing the mypy-boto3-macie2 Python library, providing metadata and dependencies information.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; uses static package and metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data processing or external inputs/outputs beyond static package data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static configuration and file reading.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a README file for long description, and calls setup() with fixed metadata. All inputs are static, and no dynamic or user-provided data is processed. No network activity, code execution, or sensitive data handling occurs. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious components.",
