{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used to package and distribute the Python module 'mypy-boto3-macie2' with its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description; it also reads package data, dependencies, and metadata specified within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system calls that could process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input sources (README.md, dependencies, package data) are used solely for packaging metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code strictly adheres to standard setup script practices. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration for packaging. It imports standard modules, reads a markdown file for long description, and calls setuptools.setup() with well-defined parameters. No code injection, network communication, or malicious logic is present. The dependencies are standard and controlled via package specifications. The script performs no operations beyond package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard package configuration file, safe for use.",
