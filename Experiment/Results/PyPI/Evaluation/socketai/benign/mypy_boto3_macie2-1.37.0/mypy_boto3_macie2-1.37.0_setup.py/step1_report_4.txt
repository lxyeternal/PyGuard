{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-macie2' with metadata and dependencies for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; importing 'setup' from setuptools; reading the 'install_requires' field for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input; the code primarily defines package metadata and configuration.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; the script reads static files and defines configuration parameters only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the script follows standard setup.py conventions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a README file for the long description, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. All data appears static and manually defined. There are no user inputs, no network operations, and no code that could be used maliciously. The only dynamic aspect is reading a local file, which is safe in this context. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package configuration with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a legitimate package setup file.",
