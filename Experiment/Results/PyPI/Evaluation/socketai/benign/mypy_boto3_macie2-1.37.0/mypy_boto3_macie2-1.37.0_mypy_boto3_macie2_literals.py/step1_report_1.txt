{
  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for AWS Macie2 service and related constants to facilitate type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions assigned to variables, importing modules based on Python version, list of string constants.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs; the code mainly defines type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is static and purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version. It then defines multiple string literal types representing AWS Macie2 service constants and enums. The code includes a comprehensive list of literals for various AWS resource identifiers, status codes, and configuration options. There are no runtime or external data processing, no network connections, and no code that could be malicious. The code is purely declarative, serving as type annotations and constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe, static declaration of AWS-related type literals for type checking purposes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could compromise security.",
