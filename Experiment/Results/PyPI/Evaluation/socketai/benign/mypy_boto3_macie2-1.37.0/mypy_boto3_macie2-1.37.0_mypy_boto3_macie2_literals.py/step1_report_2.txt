{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literal types used in the Macie2 service SDK for type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for string-based enums and type annotations, primarily in the form of string literals assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or input/output operations present; the code only defines constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or external data; the code solely provides type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright statement with an unusual year (2025) and a detailed list of string literals, which is standard for type definitions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' to conditionally import 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions', then proceeds to define a series of string literal types representing enum-like values used throughout the SDK. It only contains constant definitions and type annotations, with no input/output, network, or file operations. The purpose appears to be solely for type safety and improved code maintainability. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, non-malicious type definition module for the Macie2 SDK. It does not include any suspicious or harmful code. The only notable aspect is the future-dated copyright year, which appears to be a typo or placeholder. Overall, the code is safe and solely intended for type annotations.",
