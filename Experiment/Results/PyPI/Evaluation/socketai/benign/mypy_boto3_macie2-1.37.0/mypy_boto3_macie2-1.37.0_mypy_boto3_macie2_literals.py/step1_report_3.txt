{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations for string literals used in the AWS Macie2 service, facilitating type safety and autocompletion in Python projects.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from static string definitions, imported modules (`sys`, `typing_extensions`), and its own literal definitions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data or perform data leaks; it solely defines type literals.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the literals are static and do not involve runtime data input or processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The script is a straightforward collection of type annotations. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a documentation comment, specifying purpose and usage, followed by a conditional import to support different Python versions. It defines numerous string literal types for AWS Macie2 service integration, aiding in type checking. There is no evidence of malicious intent, code injection, or suspicious behavior. The structure is clear and solely focused on static type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type definitions module intended to improve type safety for AWS Macie2 SDK usage. It does not perform any runtime actions, data processing, or network operations. No security risks or malicious behavior are detected.",
