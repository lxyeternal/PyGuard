{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS Macie2 service parameters and constants to ensure type safety and clarity in type annotations.",
  "sources": "Importing sys and typing modules, conditional import of Literal, and defining numerous Literal type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data flow; code is static and purely defines constants.",
  "flows": "N/A, as this code only declares type literals and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior detected. The code appears to be straightforward type alias declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, which is a common compatibility pattern. It then defines a large set of type aliases using 'Literal' for various AWS Macie2 parameters, statuses, and options. All these definitions are static and do not process input, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. No obfuscated patterns, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present. The code's sole purpose is to provide precise type annotations, enhancing code correctness and readability in client code using type checkers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive collection of type literals for AWS Macie2 service parameters, implemented in a safe, static manner. There are no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It serves as a utility module for type safety, with no apparent security risks.",
