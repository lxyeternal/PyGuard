  "purpose": "Defines static Python type literals for AWS Macie2 service constants to facilitate type checking and autocompletion.",
  "sources": "Static literal definitions and conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data handling, external input, or network I/O; purely static definitions.",
  "flows": "None; the code contains only type alias declarations without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future copyright year (2025), likely a placeholder or typo, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of static string literal type aliases used for SDK type safety. It conditionally imports 'Literal' for compatibility. No dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions are present. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns are detected. The only minor anomaly is the future year, which does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended solely for type annotations. It poses no security risk or malware threat. The minor date anomaly is non-security relevant.",
