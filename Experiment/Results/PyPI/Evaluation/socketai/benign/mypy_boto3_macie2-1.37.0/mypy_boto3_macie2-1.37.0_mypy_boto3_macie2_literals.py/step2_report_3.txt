  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines Python type literals for AWS Macie2, mainly for type checking.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies that the code is static, purely declarative, with no data flow or malicious behavior. The code imports `Literal` conditionally, defines many string literal types, and includes no runtime or external data processing.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** The report assigns a risk score of 0 and malware score of 0, which is appropriate. No security risks are present.\n- **Additional notes:** The future-dated copyright (2025) is likely a typo or placeholder, but this does not impact security.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, the report's assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining string literal types for type safety.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is static, with no untrusted data handling or dynamic behavior. The only oddity is the future copyright year, which appears to be a typo.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Correctly assigned 0 for both. No security concerns.\n- **Additional notes:** No obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, static type annotations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No runtime actions or external data processing. The only minor anomaly is the future date in the copyright.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Correctly assigned 0.\n- **Additional notes:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—defining string literal types.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic code, data flow, or external interactions. The future date is noted but not problematic.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Appropriately 0.\n- **Additional notes:** No security risks detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound evaluation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No untrusted data handling, no runtime logic, no obfuscation. The code's purpose is purely static type annotations.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Additional notes:** No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static, defining type literals for AWS SDK type checking.\n- **Malware & security risk:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscation & anomalies:** Minor mention of the future date (2025) in the copyright—likely a typo or placeholder—not malicious.\n- **Reasonableness of scores:** All scores are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert judgment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Additional note:** The only minor anomaly is the future date, which does not impact security. If anything, it might be a typo or placeholder.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a static, safe collection of type annotations for AWS Macie2 service constants. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present. The reports' assessments are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like a detailed review of any specific aspect or further analysis.",
