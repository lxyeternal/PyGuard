  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any discrepancies, potential issues, or inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines Python type literals for AWS Macie2 service constants, with no external data processing.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies that the code is static, purely declarative, and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** No issues. The report is accurate. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type annotations for string enums.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes the absence of untrusted data handling or malicious intent. The mention of the future-dated copyright (2025) is likely a typo or placeholder.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns. The code remains static and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, with emphasis on aiding type safety.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is static, with no runtime or external data processing, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on defining literals for AWS Macie2, with conditional import for compatibility.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies that the code is purely for static type annotations, with no malicious intent. The future date (2025) is noted but considered a minor anomaly.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others, defining literals for AWS Macie2 parameters.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that the code is static, safe, and serves as a utility for type safety. No suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is purely static, defining string literal types for AWS SDK use. There are no runtime operations, data processing, or external inputs.\n- **Malware & Security Risks:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n- **Anomalies:** The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year (2025). This is likely a typo or placeholder and does not indicate malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Logic & Reasoning:** The reports are consistent and correctly interpret the code as safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the entire review:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — Clear, straightforward static definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.0** — No security risks identified.\n\n**Justification:** The code is purely for static type annotations, with no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions. The only minor concern is the future date, which is not harmful.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
