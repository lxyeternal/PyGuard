  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security implications, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is purely static, defining string literal types for AWS Macie2 service constants and enums.\n- It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is a common compatibility pattern.\n- No data processing, input/output, network calls, or external dependencies are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or dynamic behavior.\n- The only notable anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which appears to be a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Individual Report Evaluations**\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines Python type literals for AWS Macie2 service.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as static, safe, and purely declarative.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type annotations for SDK safety.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes no untrusted data, no malicious behavior, and the future date as likely a typo.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, for type safety and autocompletion.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states the code is static, safe, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar, defining literals for AWS Macie2.\n- **Analysis:** Notes the future copyright year as a minor anomaly, but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Again, static type literals for AWS SDK.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly emphasizes the static, safe nature, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is static and declarative.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Confidence:** All are confident (1), which is justified.\n\n**Notable Point:** The only minor anomaly is the future year (2025) in the copyright statement, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion**\n\nThe code is a static, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS Macie2 service constants. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimate**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward definitions)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 (high certainty)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate. The code is safe, purely declarative, and poses no security threats.",
