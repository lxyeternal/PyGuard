  "purpose": "Define type annotations for literals used in the Macie2 service for better type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals assigned to various Literal variables, imported modules, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None. The code does not perform any data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A - static type definitions with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future relative to current real-world dates; however, this is likely a typographical or placeholder value, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely for defining string literal types using Python's typing system, with conditional imports based on Python version. No dynamic execution, external input handling, or suspicious behavior is present. The use of future dates in comments or metadata is not inherently malicious but might be an oversight. The structure is consistent and straightforward, serving as a static type hints module for a larger SDK or project. No malicious intent or malware signals are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for defining literal type annotations. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and has no obfuscated or malicious code. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright date, which is unlikely to impact security.",
