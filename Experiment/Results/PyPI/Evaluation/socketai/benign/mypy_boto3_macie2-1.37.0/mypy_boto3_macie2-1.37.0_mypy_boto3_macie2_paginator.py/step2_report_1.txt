  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as providing type annotations and paginator classes for boto3's macie2 service, matching the code's intent.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Notes that 'paginate' methods process kwargs and return PageIterator objects, with no untrusted data processing or output. This is correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Finds no suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is standard for SDK wrappers.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes no security risks, malware, or malicious behavior, with high confidence (0.95).\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Correctly assigns 0 for malware and security risk.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is class definitions with documentation, with no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no signs of malicious behavior, with confidence 1.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk scores are 0, which aligns well.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Highlights that 'paginate' accepts untrusted kwargs but considers this standard in boto3 SDK code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious patterns or hardcoded secrets; the code is a typical SDK wrapper.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly lower (0.9), but still indicates no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0 and 0.1 respectively, which is reasonable given the context.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Points out that 'paginate' accepts kwargs that could be manipulated if user input is passed directly.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes potential concern with untrusted input but notes that within this code, there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, security risk is 0.2, which is cautious but acceptable.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, type-annotated SDK wrapper for boto3's paginator classes.\n- No report detects any malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The only concern raised is about the passing of untrusted input via kwargs into 'paginate' methods, which is inherent to boto3's design but not malicious per se.\n\n**My final evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities are evident; the code is purely for type safety and SDK convenience.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is auto-generated or boilerplate, serving as type-safe wrappers.\n- No secrets, network operations, or data exfiltration are present.\n- The potential risk with untrusted kwargs is a known aspect of SDK usage, not an inherent flaw in this code.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, standard SDK wrapper code with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n- The scores should reflect this: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown per report or further analysis.",
