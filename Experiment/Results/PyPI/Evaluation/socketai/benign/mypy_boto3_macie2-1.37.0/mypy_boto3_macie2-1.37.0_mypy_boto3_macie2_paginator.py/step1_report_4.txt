{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations and paginator classes for the 'macie2' service client in boto3, enabling type-safe pagination in Python projects.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, method signatures, and type annotations, especially in the 'paginate' methods where kwargs are unpacked into specific request types.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods use untrusted input via **kwargs, which are unpacked into predefined request types, but this is standard for boto3 paginator implementations. No data is directly sent or received in an unsafe manner.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (kwargs) flows into the 'paginate' methods, which then pass them as parameters to the underlying Paginator.paginate calls; however, these are standard boto3 patterns and not inherently malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behavior such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a straightforward, auto-generated type annotation and class wrapper for boto3 paginators.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines paginator classes with type annotations, extending the botocore Paginator. It employs conditional imports for compatibility, uses type hints for request and response types, and provides docstrings linking to documentation. No code executes untrusted commands, manipulates data maliciously, or performs actions outside standard boto3 paginator patterns. The structure and content suggest auto-generated, type-safe wrapper code for boto3 without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The code is a standard, type-annotated wrapper for boto3 paginators, aimed at improving type safety and code clarity. It contains no security risks or malicious intent.",
