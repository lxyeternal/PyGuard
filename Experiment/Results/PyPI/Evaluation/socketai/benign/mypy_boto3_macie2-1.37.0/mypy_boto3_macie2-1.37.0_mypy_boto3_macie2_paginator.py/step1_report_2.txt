{
  "purpose": "This code defines paginator classes for the AWS Macie2 service client in boto3, providing type annotations and structure for paginating through various API responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules, system version info, and method parameters in the 'paginate' functions.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods may process or return data, but there are no explicit sinks where untrusted data is used insecurely, nor are there network or file operations directly shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'client.get_paginator' calls to the 'paginate' methods, which accept keyword arguments and return 'PageIterator' objects; no external data input or output operations are shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains verbose documentation links and type annotations, with no suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious commands. No unusual behaviors or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class definitions for paginators, extending base 'Paginator' classes with a 'paginate' method that accepts specific request parameters. It uses conditional imports for 'Unpack' based on Python version, which is standard. No network, file, or command execution code is present. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns detected. All functions appear to serve legitimate paginator purposes, and the structure follows boto3 and type-hints conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, documentation-rich set of paginator class definitions for AWS Macie2 service, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely provides type annotations and class extensions for pagination functionality.",
