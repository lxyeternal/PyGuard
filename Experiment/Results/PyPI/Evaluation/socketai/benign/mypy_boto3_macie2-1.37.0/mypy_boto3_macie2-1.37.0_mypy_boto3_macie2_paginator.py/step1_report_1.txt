{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and paginator classes for the boto3 macie2 service client, enabling better static type checking and IDE support for paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads type definition imports from 'type_defs' and the method parameters for 'paginate' functions, which unpack keyword arguments for pagination requests.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods act as sinks where input data (kwargs) is received. No untrusted data processing or output is present that could lead to data leaks or command injection.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-provided kwargs into the 'paginate' methods, which pass them to the underlying Paginator's 'paginate' method; responses are returned as PageIterator objects. No malicious data flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code strictly adheres to standard patterns for boto3 paginators with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of paginator classes for each API operation in the 'macie2' service, with appropriate type hints and conditional imports based on Python version. It imports type definitions and wraps boto3's Paginator class. Each paginator class provides a 'paginate' method that accepts keyword arguments matching the request types and returns an iterator over response pages. No code executes untrusted data, nor does it include any obfuscated or malicious patterns. The structure is consistent with well-established SDK patterns, and no suspicious behavior or code injection vectors are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, type-annotated wrapper for boto3's pagination system in the macie2 service, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves purely to enhance type safety and code clarity for SDK usage.",
