  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for boto3's macie2 service, facilitating type-safe pagination.",
  "sources": "Methods like 'paginate' accepting kwargs, which are passed into boto3's paginator methods.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods passing kwargs into AWS SDK calls; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "Kwargs from callers flow into paginator methods, which invoke AWS API calls without internal processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes with type annotations, inheriting from boto3's Paginator. The 'paginate' methods accept kwargs unpacked into API calls, which is standard SDK behavior. No data is processed maliciously, no network or file operations are present, and the code is straightforward. The potential concern about untrusted kwargs is inherent to SDK usage but does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated, type-safe SDK wrapper for boto3's paginator classes for the macie2 service. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The passing of kwargs is typical and should be validated at the application level, not within this code. Overall, the code is safe and benign.",
