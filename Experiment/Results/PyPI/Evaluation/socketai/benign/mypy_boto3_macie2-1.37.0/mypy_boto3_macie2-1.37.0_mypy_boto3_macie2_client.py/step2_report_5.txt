  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to assess the potential security risks, malware likelihood, and correctness of the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and class definitions for AWS Macie2 SDK stubs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The code is purely interface and type definitions; no executable logic.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation. It’s a standard SDK stub.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully consistent with a safe, generated SDK stub. Malware score: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0, Confidence: 1.0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1, describing method signatures for the SDK.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external communication; just method signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe SDK interface, scores are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type stub definitions, class structures, and method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No execution logic; data flows are only in parameter passing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clearly a static SDK stub, safe.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, defining a typed client interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No executable code; just signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard SDK stub, safe.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, API client interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No executable logic; method signatures only.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Routine SDK code, safe.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- All reports describe static SDK interface code, primarily type annotations, method signatures, and documentation references.\n- No executable logic, no data exfiltration, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.\n- Malware scores are correctly at 0.0 across all reports.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with generated SDK stubs.\n- Risk scores are all at 0.0, reflecting no security concern.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- Given the purpose of this code (SDK stub/interface), the risk is inherently minimal.\n- No changes needed; the reports are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious code present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 — no security risks in static SDK interface code.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a safe, well-structured SDK stub with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
