{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the boto3 Macie2 service, enabling type-safe interaction with AWS Macie2.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class and method definitions including attribute types and method signatures.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that invoke AWS API calls via boto3; no direct data sinks handling untrusted data within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Method signatures indicate data flow from input parameters (unpacked kwargs) to AWS API calls; no explicit internal data flows or untrusted data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code is predominantly auto-generated stub definitions; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior. The code strictly defines types and client structure without executing any logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions, method signatures, and overloads for boto3 client operations with type annotations. It imports necessary modules, defines exceptions, and offers typed method signatures for AWS API calls. No code executes operations, manipulates data, or contains obfuscated logic. It appears to be a static type stub for AWS Macie2 SDK integration, with no malicious code or malicious intent apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a type stub and class interface for AWS Macie2 service interactions, created for static type checking. It does not contain executable logic, data processing, or any suspicious code segments. No malware or security risks are evident based on the provided snippet.",
