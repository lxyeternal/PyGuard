  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the AWS Macie2 service in Python, facilitating type-safe API calls and pagination handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class method definitions with detailed docstrings, and type annotations for request/response data structures.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that accept user-provided parameters and return data, including presigned URL generation, which could potentially be misused if parameters are malicious.",
  "flows": "Input data from method parameters flows into API calls; response data from AWS services flows back and may be used for further processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is primarily interface and type definitions with no executable logic or data processing. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. No evidence of data exfiltration, network connections, or malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only type annotations, class definitions, method signatures, and docstrings referencing AWS SDK documentation. There is no implementation logic, no handling of untrusted data beyond parameter passing, and no dynamic code execution. The presence of detailed method signatures and types is consistent with standard SDK stub generation for static typing, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious injection, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a type stub definition for the AWS Macie2 client, aimed at providing type hints and documentation links for safe API usage. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this code snippet.",
