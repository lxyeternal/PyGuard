  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the AWS Macie2 service, providing a typed interface for API calls.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method signatures, and inline documentation for API operations.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that perform API calls via boto3, which may send or receive data over the network.",
  "flows": "Method calls (sources) invoke boto3 API operations (sinks), with data passed as parameters and returned responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard AWS SDK patterns. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a typed client class for AWS Macie2, including method signatures, overloads for paginators and waiters, and documentation links. It strictly adheres to boto3 client patterns, using type annotations for request and response structures. No signs of malicious logic, code injection, or privacy violations. The presence of extensive documentation and standard API method definitions further indicates routine SDK interface code. No external or hidden data leaks, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured API client interface for AWS Macie2, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It solely provides type annotations and method signatures for legitimate API interactions.",
