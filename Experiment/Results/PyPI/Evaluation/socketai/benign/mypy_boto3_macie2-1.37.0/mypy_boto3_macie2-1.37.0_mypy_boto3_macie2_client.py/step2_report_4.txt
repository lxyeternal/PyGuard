  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that this is a type stub for the AWS Macie2 SDK, primarily providing type annotations, class definitions, and documentation links.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No actual logic, data processing, or network activity—just interface definitions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors. The code is static, purely for type hinting.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report correctly concludes this is a safe, standard SDK stub with high confidence (1.0).\n\n**Assessment:** No malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the interface and method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data manipulation or execution logic; parameters are for API calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code is consistent with SDK interface definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies this as a safe SDK stub with high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on the static class and method signatures, with imports and type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No execution, only interface definitions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. The code is a standard static stub.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, with full confidence (1.0).\n\n**Assessment:** No malware or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, a detailed SDK interface with documentation links.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No actual logic, just method signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct assessment; no risks identified.\n\n**Assessment:** Safe, standard SDK stub.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, a typical API client interface with method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No executable code; only API call signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, with full confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** No malware or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as static interface definitions with no executable logic or data manipulation. The malware score should be **0.0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, straightforward, and generated for type hinting. Obfuscation score should be **0.0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of executable logic, data handling, or external communication beyond API signatures, the overall security risk is negligible. The risk score should be **0.0**.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThis code is a set of static type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS Macie2 SDK in Python. It contains no executable logic, no data processing, no network activity, and no embedded secrets or malicious patterns. Its purpose is to facilitate static type checking and IDE support, not to perform any runtime operations or data handling.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is safe, standard SDK stub code with no security risks.",
