{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type annotations, TypedDict class definitions, and import handling for the AWS Macie2 SDK in Python. Its purpose is to serve as type hints and data schemas for API request and response validation, ensuring type safety during development.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from type annotations, import statements, and class definitions. It does not process external data or perform runtime operations.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external data handling points. The code does not write or transmit data; it only defines data structures.",
  "flows": "As a static declaration module, there are no runtime data flows. The type definitions are used by static type checkers to validate data structures during development.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations, TypedDict class definitions, and import statements. It does not include executable functions, data processing logic, or network calls. The extensive use of type hints aligns with SDK schema definitions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. The import handling for different Python versions is standard and safe. Overall, the code is a well-structured, purely declarative module intended for static type checking and API schema enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, purely declarative set of type annotations for the AWS Macie2 SDK. It contains no executable logic, no malicious behavior, and poses no security risks. It is a legitimate, safe dependency component used for type safety and validation in Python SDK development.",
