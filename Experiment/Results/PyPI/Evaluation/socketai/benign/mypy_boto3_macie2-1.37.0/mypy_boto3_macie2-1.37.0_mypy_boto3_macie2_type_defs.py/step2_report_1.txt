  "review": "After thoroughly reviewing all provided reports and the associated code, I confirm the following:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:  \n   The code consists exclusively of static type annotations, TypedDict class definitions, import statements, and export declarations for the AWS Macie2 SDK in Python. There are no executable functions, data processing logic, network calls, or external data handling mechanisms. The purpose is clearly to serve as type hints and data schemas for API request and response validation.\n\n2. **Potential Security Risks & Malware Indicators**:  \n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive information are present.\n   - No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code does not perform any runtime operations that could be exploited or malicious.\n   - The import handling for different Python versions is standard and does not introduce any security concerns.\n   - The extensive use of type annotations and documentation suggests a well-structured SDK module for static type checking.\n\n3. **Logical & Structural Analysis**:  \n   - The reports correctly identify that this is a purely static, declarative module.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or code obfuscation are present.\n   - The purpose aligns with typical SDK type definitions, with no indication of sabotage or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious behavior or code present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — The code is straightforward, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — As a static type definition module, it does not pose any security risk.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \n- The code is a static, purely declarative set of type annotations for AWS SDK in Python.  \n- It contains no executable logic, no external data sinks, and no security vulnerabilities.  \n- The high confidence scores in the reports are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My personal estimates**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThis supply chain component is safe, legitimate, and purely for static type checking. It does not pose any security threat or malicious risk.",
