  "review": "After a thorough review of all provided reports and the code content, here's a detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Code Purpose & Content**:  \n   The code is a comprehensive collection of Python type annotations, primarily using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports to define data models for the AWS Macie2 SDK. It includes request and response structures, data schemas, and documentation comments. There are no executable functions, data processing routines, or dynamic logic.\n\n2. **Potential Security Concerns**:  \n   - **Malicious Logic**: No signs of malware, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The code strictly serves as static type definitions for SDK validation and type safety.\n   - **Secrets or Credentials**: No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials are embedded within the code.\n   - **External Data Handling**: The code does not read from or write to external sources, nor does it perform network operations.\n   - **Obfuscation or Anomalies**: The code is straightforward, well-structured, and follows standard Python typing practices. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n3. **Code Quality & Logical Consistency**:  \n   - The type annotations align with typical AWS SDK data models.\n   - Import handling for different Python versions is standard.\n   - The overall structure is consistent and clear, serving its purpose for static analysis and type checking.\n\n4. **Risk & Security Assessment**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: 0. Since the code contains no executable or malicious elements.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0. The code is transparent and readable.\n   - **Overall Risk Score**: 0. The code is purely static type annotations with no security implications.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThis supply chain review confirms that the code is a static, well-structured set of type definitions for the AWS Macie2 SDK in Python. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is free from obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:  \n- No changes needed.  \n- Continue monitoring for any runtime code or scripts that might interact with this module, but as-is, this code is safe.\n\n**Estimated Scores**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
