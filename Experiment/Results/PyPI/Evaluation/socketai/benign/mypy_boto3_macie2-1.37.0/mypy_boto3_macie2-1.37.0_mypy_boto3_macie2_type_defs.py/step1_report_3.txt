  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Macie2 service interactions, primarily for request/response modeling and data validation.",
  "sources": "Module imports, type annotations, and data class definitions; no external data sources or input parsing present.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no code executes or handles untrusted data at runtime.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; code purely defines types and data structures without runtime logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious identifiers; no backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions using TypedDict and Union for AWS Macie2 SDK, designed for static type checking and API request/response validation. It includes imports, conditional compatibility imports, and a large number of data structure definitions. No runtime logic, code execution, or external data handling mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured type annotations module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a purely declarative module for type annotations and data validation, with no evidence of malicious intent, supply chain attack, or sabotage. It functions solely to define data schemas for the AWS SDK interface.",
