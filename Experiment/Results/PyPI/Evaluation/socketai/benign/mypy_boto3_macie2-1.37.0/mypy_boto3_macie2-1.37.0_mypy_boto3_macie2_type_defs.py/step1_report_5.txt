  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Macie2 service responses and requests.",
  "sources": "None (standard library imports and local type definitions); no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "None (no code executes or processes data at runtime); purely type annotations and data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "None (no executable logic or data flow, just type definitions).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code solely defines TypedDicts for data validation and structure.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements for standard libraries and type extension libraries, followed by extensive TypedDict class definitions for AWS Macie2 service requests and responses. No functions, data processing, or runtime logic is present. The code is purely for type hinting and data validation, with no dynamic code execution, no external data reading, or network activity. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or sabotage. The presence of documentation and licensing info suggests legitimate intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module contains purely structural type annotations for AWS SDK responses and requests, with no executable code or runtime behavior. It does not exhibit any malicious or sabotage activity. The purpose is for type safety and data validation within a larger codebase.",
