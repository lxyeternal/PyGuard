  "purpose": "Type annotations for Macie2 service type definitions, providing structured data models for AWS SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "The code defines TypedDict classes, imports modules for type annotations, and specifies type aliases and Union types. No runtime input or data reading mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains only type definitions with no executable logic or data sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists as there are no runtime operations; it is purely type annotation code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. The code is consistent with standard Python type annotations for AWS SDK models.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of type annotations using TypedDict, Union, and import statements for type safety. It imports necessary modules based on Python version, defines data models, and lists them for export. No runtime code, input/output handling, or security-sensitive operations are present. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no indications of malicious intent. All elements appear to be standard for SDK type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely static type annotation for AWS Macie2 SDK, with no executable or malicious elements. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
