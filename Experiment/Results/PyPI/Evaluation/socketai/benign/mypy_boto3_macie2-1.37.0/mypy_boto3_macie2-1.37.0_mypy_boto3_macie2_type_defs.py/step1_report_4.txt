  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Macie2 service type safety in Python.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type annotations, and TypedDict definitions that specify data structures and API request/response types.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily defines types and data structures, with no runtime data processing or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows are not explicitly coded; the definitions serve as schemas for data, not executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is strictly a collection of Python type hints and TypedDict schemas for the Macie2 service. It imports standard typing modules and conditionally imports based on Python version. All type definitions are straightforward, serving as data models for API requests/responses. No runtime logic, network calls, or data manipulations are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The presence of detailed type annotations and documentation comments suggests the code is intended for static type checking and API schema enforcement only.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for the AWS Macie2 SDK in Python, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely structural and static, serving as type hints for safer API interactions.",
