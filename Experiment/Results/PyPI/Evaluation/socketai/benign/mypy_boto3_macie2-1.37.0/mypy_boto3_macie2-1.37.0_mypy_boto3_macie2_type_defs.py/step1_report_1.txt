{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the AWS Macie2 service SDK, providing type hints for API request and response objects.",
  "sources": "Constant imports (literals), standard library imports, type alias imports, class and variable declarations defining TypedDict structures, union types, and module exports.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted input handling present; no network, file, or external system interactions observed in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; mainly static type definitions with no executable logic or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The file strictly contains type definitions and imports, with no runtime behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a large collection of type annotations and TypedDict definitions for a Python SDK for AWS Macie2. It includes import handling for different Python versions, detailed class definitions, and export declarations. There are no executable statements, no network operations, no data processing, nor any code that could be malicious. All components appear to serve the purpose of type hinting for API request/response structures. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This file is a static type annotation module for the AWS SDK, containing no executable code or malicious logic. It is safe and purely for type checking purposes.",
