  "review": "Based on the comprehensive review of all provided reports, which uniformly identify the code as a static, purely declarative module containing no executable logic, network operations, or data handling beyond type annotations, the following conclusions are warranted:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is a collection of TypedDict classes, type aliases, and import statements intended solely for static type checking and API schema enforcement.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:** None identified. The code adheres to standard Python typing practices, with appropriate conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions.\n\n- **Score Justifications:**\n  - **Malware Score:** Given the absence of any executable code, network activity, or data manipulation, the malware score should be **0**.\n  - **Obfuscated Score:** The code is transparent, well-structured, and lacks any obfuscation or suspicious patterns, so the obfuscated score should be **0**.\n  - **Risk Score:** Since there are no runtime behaviors, secrets, or potential attack vectors, the overall security risk is **0**.\n\n- **Potential Assumptions or Claims:** All claims about the code's purpose as static type definitions are accurate. No assumptions about hidden vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified.\n\n- **Consistency of Scores:** The reports' assigned scores (malware, obfuscated, risk) are all at 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n**Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n| Score Type      | Suggested Value | Justification                                                      |\n|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score   | 0                 | No executable or malicious code present                            |\n| Obfuscated Score| 0               | Clear, straightforward type annotations without obfuscation       |\n| Risk Score      | 0                 | Purely static type definitions with no runtime or external interactions |\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured set of static type annotations for the AWS Macie2 SDK in Python. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free from obfuscation or malicious intent. It is safe for inclusion in any supply chain or dependency context, serving solely as a type hinting module.",
