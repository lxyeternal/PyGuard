  "review": "**Overall Security Assessment of the Provided Type Definitions for AWS Macie2 SDK**\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- The code consists solely of static type annotations, TypedDict definitions, imports, and export declarations.\n- No executable logic, data processing, network calls, or external input handling are present.\n- The code includes conditional imports for Python version compatibility, which is standard practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose is clearly to provide type hints and data schemas for static type checking, not runtime behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Structural Review:\n- The type definitions are comprehensive, covering request and response structures for AWS Macie2 API interactions.\n- The code adheres to best practices for type safety in Python, using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports.\n- No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- Documentation comments and licensing info are present, indicating legitimate SDK type definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and Security Risk Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious code, payloads, or dynamic behaviors detected.\n- **Obfuscated Code:** 0 — The code is clear, straightforward, and lacks any obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — Purely static type definitions with no runtime or external interactions.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The report's conclusion that this is a safe, purely static module is accurate.\n- The detailed type annotations serve as a safeguard for SDK consumers, ensuring type safety and correctness.\n- No evidence suggests any supply chain attack, malicious intent, or sabotage.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.5 or below) are appropriate and should remain unchanged.\n- **Potential for concern:** None. The code is a standard, well-structured static type module.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is a safe, static type annotation module with no malicious or security concerns. It is a typical SDK type definition file, serving purely for type safety and validation purposes.",
