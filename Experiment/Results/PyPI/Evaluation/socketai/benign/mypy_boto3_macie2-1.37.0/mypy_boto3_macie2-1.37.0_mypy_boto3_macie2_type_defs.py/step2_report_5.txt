  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment of all reports:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** All reports confirm that the code is a large collection of static type annotations, primarily using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. The code is meant for static type checking, API request/response modeling, and data validation for the AWS Macie2 SDK.\n\n- **Sources & Flows:** No runtime logic, data processing, network operations, or external data sources are present. The code is purely declarative, defining data schemas.\n\n- **Sinks & Anomalies:** No data sinks, external interactions, or suspicious patterns are identified. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are observed.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All reports consistently state that the code is a static, well-structured type annotation module with no executable or malicious behavior. They emphasize that the code serves as a schema for API interactions and is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Consistency:\n- **Presence of executable code or malicious intent:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Malware & security risk scores:** All are zero, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Type correctness & completeness:** The type definitions are extensive and detailed, aligning with the purpose of SDK type hints.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying that this code is purely for static type annotations.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious activity are made beyond the observed static definitions.\n- The import handling for different Python versions is standard and safe.\n- No signs of supply chain attack, sabotage, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, well-structured type definitions.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — No security risk, as the code is static and non-executable.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is a static, well-formed set of type annotations for the AWS Macie2 SDK, serving as data schemas for API interactions. It contains no executable logic, no malicious code, and no security risks. The detailed type definitions are standard for SDKs and do not pose any threat.\n\n**Final verdict:** No security concerns. The code is safe, purely structural, and serves its purpose for type safety and validation.",
