  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definition for Macie2 service client waiters in boto3-stubs.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definition, and method signature.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data sinks like network or file operations.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from source to sink involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type annotations and a subclass of boto3's Waiter class for the Macie2 client. It imports necessary modules, defines a class with a wait method that accepts specific parameters, and contains documentation links. There is no dynamic code execution, data processing, or external network communication within this snippet. The use of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard and not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured type annotation module for boto3 waiters. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and poses no security risks.",
