  "purpose": "Type annotations and waiters for the macie2 service client, facilitating structured API interactions with AWS Macie2.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, botocore.waiter, type_defs), class method wait with **kwargs parameter.",
  "sinks": "The wait method with **kwargs potentially passing untrusted input to underlying AWS SDK functions.",
  "flows": "kwargs from the wait method are unpacked and passed to the parent class's wait implementation, likely calling AWS APIs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. Usage of conditional import based on Python version is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Waiter for a specific AWS service, adding a wait method with flexible parameters. It includes type annotations and documentation links. No external data input sources or dangerous sinks are present. The code relies on established SDKs and follows standard patterns for AWS service waiters.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard extension for AWS SDK waiters with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It facilitates waiting for a specific AWS resource state. No anomalies or malware indicators are present.",
