{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and waiter class definition for the Macie2 service client in boto3, used for waiting on specific AWS resource states.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs; class method wait() with kwargs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; no network or system command execution.",
  "flows": "No evident data flow from untrusted sources to sinks. The wait() method calls parent class without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual code behavior. The code appears straightforward and standard for type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a type annotation class for AWS SDK waiter, including documentation links and version-specific imports. No data processing or external data handling is present. It imports necessary modules safely and adheres to standard practices. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The wait() method overrides the parent class without additional logic, indicating standard usage. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious instructions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of a type-annotated waiter class for AWS SDK, with no malicious intent or security issues identified.",
