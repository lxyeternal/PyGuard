{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and subclassing for the 'finding_revealed' waiter in the macie2 service client, facilitating type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type definitions; class inheritance; method definition with kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The wait() method accepts kwargs and delegates to the parent class; no external data or command execution.",
  "flows": "kwargs from wait() are passed directly to the Waiter superclass, which may invoke AWS SDK wait operations internally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. Conditional import based on Python version is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward subclass of botocore.waiter.Waiter, primarily serving as a type annotation utility with documentation links. It accepts flexible kwargs in wait(), delegating to the parent class without modification. No external data processing, network calls, or untrusted input handling are present. The code adheres to standard SDK extension patterns and contains no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SDK utility for type annotations and subclassing, posing no security risks, containing no malware, and not obfuscated. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
