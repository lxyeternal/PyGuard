{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and a subclass for the macie2 service client's waiters, specifically for handling the 'finding_revealed' waiter.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type definitions; class and method definitions that do not process external data directly.",
  "sinks": "The wait() method potentially accepts arbitrary keyword arguments for wait conditions, but it does not process or execute external data or commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly defines a class structure and method signature.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a straightforward type annotation and subclassing for SDK purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a subclass of botocore's Waiter for a specific AWS service waiter. It includes conditional imports based on Python version and documentation links. There are no input processing, no data transformations, or external command executions. It solely defines a class and a method with type annotations, aligned with SDK design patterns. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign SDK utility for type annotations and class extension, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
