{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and a custom waiter class for the macie2 service client in boto3, mainly for type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and a local type_defs module; class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no use of untrusted input, external data, or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the class wraps a standard waiter with type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; the code is straightforward and serves documentation/type checking functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system and library modules, defines a subclass of Waiter with an overridden wait method annotated for type checking, and includes documentation links. It performs no data processing, network operations, or untrusted input handling. The code appears to be purely for type annotations and documentation, with no malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured type annotation wrapper for boto3 waiters, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
