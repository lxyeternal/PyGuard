  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the potential security implications, consistency of scores, and any discrepancies.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward subclass of `botocore.waiter.Waiter` for the `finding_revealed` waiter in the `macie2` service.\n- The code primarily involves type annotations, class inheritance, and documentation links.\n- No external data processing, network calls, or untrusted input handling are evident.\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior.\n- The `wait()` method accepts `**kwargs` and passes them to the parent class without modification, which is standard for SDK wrapper classes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports agree that the code is benign, with no security issues or malicious behavior. The code matches the original code snippet provided.\n- **Issue detection:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or anomalies are present in the code.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or flaws:** None are identified. The reports correctly interpret the code as a simple SDK utility for type annotations and subclassing.\n- **Misleading claims:** None. All reports consistently describe the code as benign and standard.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All assign `0`. Given the benign nature, this is justified.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The `wait()` method's `kwargs` are passed directly to the parent class, which could, in theory, be misused if someone supplies malicious parameters. However, since this is a subclass for SDK internal use, and the method is documented as a wrapper, this is standard practice and not a security concern.\n- The conditional import based on Python version is standard and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, well-structured SDK utility for type annotations and subclassing. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's actual content.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own estimates based on this review, I would concur with the current scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis confirms the reports' assessments.",
