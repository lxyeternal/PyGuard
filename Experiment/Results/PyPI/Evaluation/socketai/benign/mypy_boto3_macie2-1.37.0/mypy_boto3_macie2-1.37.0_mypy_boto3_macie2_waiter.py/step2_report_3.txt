  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward subclass of `botocore.waiter.Waiter`, adding type annotations and documentation.\n- No external data processing, network calls, or command execution occurs.\n- The `wait()` method accepts flexible kwargs, but it delegates to the parent class without processing data, which is standard.\n- The code is consistent with SDK extension patterns, with conditional imports based on Python version.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and subclass for 'finding_revealed' waiter.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly describes the code. No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.5 (or 0). The report assigns 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, for the same waiter.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The report's scores are appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, for type annotations and class definition.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotation wrapper.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard waiter subclass with flexible kwargs.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity. The kwargs are passed to AWS SDK, which is normal.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.5 or 0. The report assigns 0, which is reasonable.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence:** Confirmed. The code is as described.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All are appropriately low (0 or 0.5). Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard SDK utility for type annotations and subclassing, with no security issues. The reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nI recommend maintaining the scores at 0 for malware and obfuscated, and risk at 0, given the evidence. The code is a typical pattern for SDK extension, with no signs of malicious intent.",
