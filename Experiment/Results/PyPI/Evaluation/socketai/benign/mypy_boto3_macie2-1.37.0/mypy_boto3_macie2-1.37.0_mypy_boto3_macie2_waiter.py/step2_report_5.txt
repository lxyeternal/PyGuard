  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code defines a subclass for the 'finding_revealed' waiter in the macie2 service, mainly for type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or commands are processed; the wait() method only accepts kwargs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward, serving as a type annotation utility.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign SDK utility with no security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent with analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard class extension and type annotations.\n- No data processing or external commands.\n- No anomalies detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the class definition and type annotations.\n- No data flow from untrusted sources, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Describes the code as a type annotation wrapper, with no malicious behavior.\n- No external data or network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Notes that the wait() method passes kwargs to AWS SDK, which may trigger network calls internally.\n- No untrusted input sources are evident; kwargs are intended for SDK wait parameters.\n- No suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code presence:** The code is purely for type annotations and subclassing of AWS SDK waiters. No data processing, no network activity, no external command execution.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected; the code is standard SDK extension.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Zero; no secrets, no external data handling, no malicious logic.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, well-structured SDK utility module with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
