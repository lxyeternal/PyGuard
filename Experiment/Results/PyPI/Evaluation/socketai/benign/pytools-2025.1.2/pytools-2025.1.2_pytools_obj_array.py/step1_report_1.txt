  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling numpy object arrays, including creation, vectorization, and manipulation, primarily for internal use in numerical computations.",
  "sources": "No explicit external data sources or inputs are read; functions operate on parameters passed to them, mainly numpy arrays or lists.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or external systems; the code mainly manipulates numpy arrays and functions.",
  "flows": "Function calls pass data through numpy array manipulations, vectorization, and recursive processing, with no external communication or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of deprecated functions with warnings, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code is mainly utility functions with no clear malicious intent. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for creating, flattening, and vectorizing numpy object arrays, with some functions marked deprecated. No external data sources or sinks are present. No network activity, file system modifications, or suspicious behaviors are detected. Use of warnings for deprecated functions does not imply malicious intent. The code appears to be a standard utility module for internal numerical processing with no malicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of utility functions for numpy object array handling. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. No security risks are identified based on the provided code. It appears safe and legitimate.",
