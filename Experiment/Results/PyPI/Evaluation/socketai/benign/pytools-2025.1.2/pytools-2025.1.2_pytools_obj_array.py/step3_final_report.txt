  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling numpy object arrays, including creation, flattening, vectorization, and deprecated functions with warnings.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as lists, numpy arrays, and object arrays; no external data sources or system input.",
  "sinks": "No external system interactions, data leaks, or network activity; functions operate internally on data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows within array manipulations, flattening, and vectorization functions; no external data flow or system effect.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of deprecated functions emitting warnings; no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for numpy object array creation, flattening, vectorization, and handling. All functions are standard, well-documented, and do not perform any external system calls or network activity. The deprecated functions are typical maintenance notices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and safe for supply chain use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. It is a standard utility module for numpy object array handling, and the deprecated functions are part of routine maintenance. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0.",
