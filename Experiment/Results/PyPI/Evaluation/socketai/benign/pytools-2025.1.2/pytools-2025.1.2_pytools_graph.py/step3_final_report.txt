  "purpose": "A collection of standard graph algorithms including graph reversal, A* search, SCC detection, topological sort, transitive closure, cycle detection, induced subgraph extraction, visualization, validation, connectivity check, undirected graph construction, and reachability analysis.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as graph data structures, input node identifiers, and optional functions for labels or heuristics.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include data structures (dicts, lists, sets), visualization strings, and exceptions; no external data leaks or system calls detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through algorithm logic to outputs; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-known graph algorithms using standard Python idioms. It operates solely on data passed via parameters, with no external network, file, or system interactions. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions are transparent, and the logic aligns with established algorithms. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured collection of graph utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use and poses no threat.",
