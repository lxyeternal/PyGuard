  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The reviewer finds no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code implements standard graph algorithms with transparent logic. No anomalies detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears legitimate, with no signs of malware or sabotage. The confidence is high (1), and malware/security risk scores are 0.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code. No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the reviewer finds the code well-structured, standard, and free of malicious intent. No external data leaks or malicious behaviors.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code, which is a collection of common graph algorithms. The confidence is high (0.9), malware score 0.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion is justified. No changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** The reviewer notes the code implements standard algorithms, with no signs of malicious activity, network access, or secret leaks. Data flows are internal, and no suspicious constructs are present.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is thorough, and the conclusion that the code is safe and benign is consistent with the code's content.\n\n- **Verdict:** No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** The reviewer again finds the code to be a comprehensive, standard collection of graph algorithms, with no malicious behavior or malicious sinks. No external system calls or network operations are present.\n\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the code, which is a typical graph utility library. The confidence is high (0.95), malware score 0.\n\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** The reviewer confirms all functions are standard, with no malicious payloads, data leaks, or suspicious constructs. The code uses safe practices and typical algorithms.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent, and the conclusion that the code is safe and legitimate holds.\n\n- **Verdict:** No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports agree that the code is a standard, legitimate graph utility library.\n- **Malware / Obfuscated / Security risk scores:** All are zero, as expected.\n- **Logical flaws or errors:** None detected.\n- **Any assumptions or suspicious claims:** None; all reports base their conclusions on standard, well-understood algorithms and practices.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, well-implemented set of graph algorithms with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the detailed reviews, I concur with the assessments. The code poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. It is a standard, safe utility module for graph processing.",
