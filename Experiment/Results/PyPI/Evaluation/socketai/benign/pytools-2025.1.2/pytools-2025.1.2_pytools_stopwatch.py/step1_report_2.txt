{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility classes for timing and job progress estimation, including a stopwatch, job tracking, and ETA estimation.",
  "sources": "Reads input from method calls, class attributes, and global variables (HIDDEN_JOBS, VISIBLE_JOBS, JOB_TIMES, PRINT_JOBS).",
  "sinks": "Outputs to standard output via print statements, modifies global dictionaries and references, but no untrusted data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "No external untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks; data is primarily internal state and control flow for progress reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The use of assert statements for input validation is benign but could be exploited in some environments; however, this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines timing utilities and job progress reporting, relying on standard libraries (time) and safe constructs. The use of global state (e.g., JOB_TIMES, global lists) is typical for such utilities. No dynamic code execution, external network activity, or suspicious behavior detected. The print statements are for user feedback and do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code or hidden mechanisms identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for job timing and progress estimation. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The design is straightforward, with no suspicious data leaks or external communication.",
