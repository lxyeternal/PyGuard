  "purpose": "Utility classes for timing, job tracking, ETA estimation, and progress reporting.",
  "sources": "Reads system time via time.time(), accesses global variables (HIDDEN_JOBS, VISIBLE_JOBS, JOB_TIMES, PRINT_JOBS), and uses print statements for output.",
  "sinks": "Print statements output timing and job info; global variables store timing data and job visibility states.",
  "flows": "Code reads system time and global variables; outputs via print; updates global JOB_TIMES; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of global mutable state and print statements are typical for utility modules, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements timing and progress utilities with standard Python features, relying on global state and print statements for user feedback. No external data inputs, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The use of assert statements and external libraries appears benign. The global variables are used for internal state management typical of such utilities. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected. The low security risk scores (~0.1) in some reports are justified by the use of global variables and output statements but do not indicate security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for timing and progress reporting with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary.",
