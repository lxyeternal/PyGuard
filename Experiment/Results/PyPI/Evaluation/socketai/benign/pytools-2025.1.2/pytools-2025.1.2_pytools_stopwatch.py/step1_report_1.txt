{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility classes for timing, progress estimation, and job management, likely for tracking the execution of tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from system time functions (time.time()), global variables (HIDDEN_JOBS, VISIBLE_JOBS, JOB_TIMES, PRINT_JOBS), and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing to the console (print statements) and updating global data structures. No untrusted external data input sources or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Time is read from system clock in StopWatch; data flows from StopWatch to Job (for timing), and to print_job_summary for output; user-visible controls via PRINT_JOBS influence behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation observed. The use of global mutable state (JOB_TIMES, lists) is typical for this utility code but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a stopwatch for measuring elapsed time, a job tracker that can display progress, and an ETA estimator. It uses standard Python features and publicly available libraries. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are detected. The global variables suggest intended visibility control and timing accumulation but do not introduce security risks. The print statements are controlled via user-accessible references and do not leak sensitive data by themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a utility module for tracking job durations and progress, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling.",
