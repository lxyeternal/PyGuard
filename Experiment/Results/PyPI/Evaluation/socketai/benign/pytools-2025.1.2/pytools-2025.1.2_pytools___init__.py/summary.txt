  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-maintained utility library with no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks. The external interactions are standard and controlled. The malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and the risk score should be low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting typical utility functions with minimal security concern."
