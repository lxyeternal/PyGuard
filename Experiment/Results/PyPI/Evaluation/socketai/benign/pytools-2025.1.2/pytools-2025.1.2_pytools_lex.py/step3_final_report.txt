  "purpose": "A regex-based lexing and parsing utility with custom error classes, regex encapsulation, token matching, and iterator support.",
  "sources": "Input string 's' processed by regex match objects and token definitions",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; operates solely in-memory",
  "flows": "Regex match objects and string slices flow from source input to token collection",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard regex lexing with custom error handling, token matching, and iteration. It does not perform external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration. The regex matching is straightforward, and the structure aligns with typical lexers. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard regex lexing utility with no malicious or suspicious features. The scores are appropriate and align with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
