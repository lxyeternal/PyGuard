{
  "purpose": "This code appears to implement a simple regex-based lexical analysis framework, including custom error classes, regex matching, and a lexing process with token iteration capabilities.",
  "sources": "Input strings for the lex() function, which reads raw string data to produce tokens based on provided regex rules.",
  "sinks": "No clear sink for untrusted data or external system effects. The code does not perform any data output, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The main flow involves lex() calling _matches_rule() to match regex rules against the input string, building tokens, which are stored in the lexed list, and then using LexIterator for token traversal.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code relies solely on regex matching and standard Python features. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a regex-based lexing system with custom error handling. It compiles regex patterns, matches tokens, and iterates over token streams. No external resource access or data leaks are evident. All functions appear to serve typical lexical analysis purposes. No malicious patterns or vulnerabilities are detected, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code operates purely in-memory and adheres to expected patterns for such systems.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard lexical analysis utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears safe for use in parsing tasks without security risks.",
