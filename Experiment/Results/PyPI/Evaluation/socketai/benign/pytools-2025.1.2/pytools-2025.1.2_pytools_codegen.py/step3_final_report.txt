  "purpose": "Utilities for source code generation, including classes for managing code snippets, indentation, and removing common indentation from code strings.",
  "sources": "Internal string inputs, such as code snippets and indentation lines; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "String manipulations within class methods and functions, primarily string concatenation and splitting.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility classes and functions for code formatting and indentation management. It operates solely on strings and internal state, with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are present. The license and documentation are standard, and the code structure is clear. All signals indicate benign, utility-focused code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility library for source code generation and indentation handling. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score should be 0. The low risk score (~0.1) is appropriate given its utility nature.",
