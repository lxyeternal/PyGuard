{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for generating source code, including a CodeGenerator class, indentation management, and indentation removal functions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code is self-contained and primarily involves internal string manipulations and class methods.",
  "sinks": "String manipulation functions and methods that generate code output, but no direct sinks for untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input data (such as code snippets) flows through indentation removal, and string concatenation functions, but there are no untrusted data flows into security-critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code strictly deals with text processing and code formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code offers a set of classes and functions for source code generation and indentation handling. It includes mechanisms for extending code snippets, managing indentation levels, and removing common indentation from code strings. No external input sources or untrusted data handling are present. No network calls, file I/O, or sensitive data handling identified. The code does not include any obfuscated or malicious logic; it is standard utility code for code formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for source code formatting with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard string and indentation manipulations without any malicious or suspicious code constructs.",
