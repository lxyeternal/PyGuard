{
  "purpose": "The code provides tools for source code generation and indentation management, intended for use in code templating or code creation workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings in functions like remove_common_indentation and __call__ method of CodeGenerator, and in the extend method where it reads code from another CodeGenerator instance.",
  "sinks": "The __call__ method appends processed strings to the code list, which could potentially include untrusted input if misused, but no direct unsafe operations are performed. No data leaks or dangerous actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed in remove_common_indentation or __call__, then stored in code list; these flows are internal data handling without external influence or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The code uses standard Python practices and well-understood patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a source code generator with indentation management. It features functions to manipulate strings and manage indentation levels, with no network operations, external data access, or cryptographic functions. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs are detected. Its purpose is to facilitate safe code generation with indentation handling. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign and purely focused on code generation utilities. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The overall security risk score is very low.",
