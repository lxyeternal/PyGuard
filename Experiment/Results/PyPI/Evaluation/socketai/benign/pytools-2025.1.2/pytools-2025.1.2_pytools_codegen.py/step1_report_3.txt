{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for source code generation, including managing indentation and removing common indentation from code snippets.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from parameters in methods like add_to_preamble, __call__, and remove_common_indentation; no external data sources are accessed.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs generated code strings via get() and __call__, but there are no untrusted data handling or insecure output vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed in add_to_preamble, __call__, and remove_common_indentation, then assembled into code strings with proper indentation. No external sinks or untrusted data flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The code appears purely utility-based for source code generation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for code generation and indentation management, with functions for removing common indentation. It processes input strings to generate formatted code snippets, with no network access, file operations, or external data handling. No suspicious or malicious logic is present. The functions and classes are straightforward and serve common utilities, with no indications of obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility library for source code generation, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks detected. It is consistent with intended functionality and lacks suspicious patterns.",
