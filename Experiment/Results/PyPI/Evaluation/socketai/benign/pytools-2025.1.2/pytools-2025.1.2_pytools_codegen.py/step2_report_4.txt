  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of utilities for source code generation, indentation management, and indentation removal.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, operates on strings, and lacks external data sources or network activity.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- No dynamic code execution (eval, exec), file I/O, or network calls are present.\n- The license and documentation are standard, with no signs of backdoors or hardcoded secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Review:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code?**  \n  No. The code is purely utility functions/classes for code generation and formatting.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  No evident logical errors or security flaws. The only minor point is that `remove_common_indentation` raises a `ValueError` if indentation is inconsistent, which is expected behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  None. The code is clear and well-structured.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  No. The code does not process untrusted data in a way that could lead to code injection or execution.\n\n---\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \nAll reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \nAll reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \nAll reports assign very low risk (0.1 or 0.2). Given the benign nature, this seems reasonable. The only exception is report 5, which has 0.2; still acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Claims about source/sink/data flow:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that data flows are internal string manipulations with no external data or dangerous sinks.\n\n- **Anomalies or suspicious behavior:**  \n  None observed.\n\n- **License and documentation:**  \n  Standard open-source license, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Recommendations:\n\n- The code is a utility library for source code generation, with no malicious or obfuscated components.\n- The scores for malware and obfuscated are appropriately zero.\n- The risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0** (correct)  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** (correct)  \n**Risk Score:** **0.1** (appropriate, given it's utility code with minimal risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe, and the reports are consistent with the actual code behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified. All reports are accurate in their assessments.",
