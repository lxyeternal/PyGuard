{
  "purpose": "This code provides tools for source code generation, including classes for managing code and indentation, and a utility function to remove common indentation from code strings.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present in the code; all data used in functions and classes are internal or provided as parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any apparent sinks where untrusted data could be exploited, such as network operations, file writes, or system calls.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code purely manipulates strings and manages internal state within classes and functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard and well-structured. No suspicious or unusual behavior, such as dynamic code execution, backdoors, or hidden functionalities, is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of source code generation utilities, including a CodeGenerator class for managing code lines, a context manager for indentation, and a function to remove common indentation. There are no external data sources, no network or I/O operations, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns. All functions operate on provided parameters and internal state only, with clear and typical behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution is evident. The license and documentation are standard, and the code lacks any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, intended for source code generation utilities, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe for use.",
