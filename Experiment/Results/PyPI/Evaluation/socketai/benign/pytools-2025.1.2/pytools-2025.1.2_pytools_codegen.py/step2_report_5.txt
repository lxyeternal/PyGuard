  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of utilities for source code generation, indentation management, and indentation removal.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, well-structured, and operates solely on provided strings and internal state.\n- No external data sources, network activity, file I/O, or dynamic code execution (eval, exec, subprocess) are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code does not contain any apparent sinks that could lead to security vulnerabilities, nor does it process untrusted data in a dangerous way.\n- The purpose is utility-based, aimed at formatting and generating source code snippets.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low (0 to 0.2), reflecting the benign utility nature.\n\n**Potential issues or anomalies:**\n\n- No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or vulnerabilities are reported or observed.\n- The functions and classes are standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment of the scores:**\n\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low, given the nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, the code is a benign utility library for source code generation, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening features.\n\n---\n\n### My final estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal risk, primarily due to its utility purpose; slightly higher than zero but still very low.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' assessments.** The code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
