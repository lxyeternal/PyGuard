{
  "purpose": "Provides tools for source code generation and managing indentation for code formatting.",
  "sources": "Input is mainly from function parameters such as strings in add_to_preamble and __call__, and method calls within the class.",
  "sinks": "Methods that modify internal state or output, such as add_to_preamble, __call__, and get, but do not handle untrusted external data directly.",
  "flows": "Input strings passed to __call__ or add_to_preamble flow into internal lists; get compiles code for output without external untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for source code generation, indentation management, and removing common indentation from code strings. It handles strings and internal state without any external data fetching or network activity. The functions operate on provided input strings with standard string manipulation. No use of eval, exec, or subprocess calls that could execute arbitrary code or perform malicious actions. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility for code formatting and generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless utility module for source code generation and indentation management, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It operates solely on provided strings and internal state.",
