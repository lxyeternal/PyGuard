  "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the insecure pattern of executing remote code without validation, which could lead to malicious activity or system compromise. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with high malware and risk scores justified by the potential for malicious payloads. It is strongly recommended to avoid executing untrusted remote code or to implement validation mechanisms such as checksums or signatures."
