{
  "purpose": "In-memory relational database table implementation with data manipulation, filtering, joining, and CSV export functionalities.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from method parameters, class attributes, and iterators. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are explicitly read in this code.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to CSV files via write_csv method; data is stored and manipulated within the class; no external network or system calls are made.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs (parameters) into internal data structures; methods like filtered, get, join, and write_csv process or output data. There are no indications of data being sent to untrusted destinations or executed as code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears straightforward, with standard data manipulation logic. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an in-memory table with typical data operations such as insert, filter, join, sort, and export. All functions operate on internal data structures without external dependencies or network communication. Data input sources are method parameters, and sinks include CSV output, which is common for data export. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are detected. The implementation appears to be a standard, benign data handling utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign in-memory data table implementation with standard functionality. No malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks are evident based on the provided code. It appears safe for use from a supply chain security perspective.",
