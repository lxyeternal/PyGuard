  "purpose": "An in-memory relational database table supporting CRUD, filtering, joining, aggregation, and CSV export functionalities.",
  "sources": "Method parameters (e.g., column names, data, filter criteria), internal data structures (self.data, self.column_names, self.column_indices).",
  "sinks": "write_csv method writing data to file-like objects.",
  "flows": "Data is read from method inputs and internal structures; filtered data flows into CSV output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The join method assumes pre-sorted data but this is standard and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an in-memory relational table with standard Python features. No network calls, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. The only external sink is CSV writing, which is benign. The join method's assumption about sorted data is a typical requirement, not a security concern. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured in-memory data table implementation with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score is appropriate, though it could be lowered to zero given the absence of vulnerabilities. Overall, the supply chain risk is very low, and the code can be considered safe under normal usage.",
