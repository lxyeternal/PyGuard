  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured in-memory data table implementation with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score is appropriate, though it could be lowered to zero given the absence of vulnerabilities. Overall, the supply chain risk is very low, and the code can be considered safe under normal usage."
