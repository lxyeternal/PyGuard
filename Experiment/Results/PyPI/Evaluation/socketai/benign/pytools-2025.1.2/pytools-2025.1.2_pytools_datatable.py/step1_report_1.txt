  "purpose": "In-memory relational database table implementation supporting basic operations like insert, filter, join, and aggregation.",
  "sources": "Input data from method parameters, file-like objects in write_csv, and internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "write_csv method writes data to external files; no other obvious sinks. No network or sensitive data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Data is taken from parameters, processed internally, and potentially written out via write_csv. No external network or system commands are invoked.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code appears standard for a lightweight in-memory database. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic execution patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a data table class with various data manipulation methods such as insert, filter, join, aggregate, and write to CSV. It relies solely on standard Python features and data structures. No network, system calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The only external interaction is writing CSV data via write_csv, which is a typical feature. No code injection, malicious logic, or privacy-invasive behavior is detected. The overall design seems consistent with legitimate functionality, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign in-memory relational database table implementation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The security risk is minimal, primarily because it is straightforward and uses standard Python features only.",
