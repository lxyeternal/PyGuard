  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is a benign utility module with no external inputs, no network or file operations, and no malicious patterns. The functions are simple string manipulations with assertions for correctness.\n- **Verdict:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Score adjustments:** The scores of malware (0), obfuscated (0), and security risk (0) are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Confirmed, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** The report emphasizes that the code is a set of utility functions with assertions, no external data or malicious behavior. It correctly identifies that the code is for testing string processing.\n- **Verdict:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present.\n- **Score adjustments:** Scores are appropriate; malware (0), obfuscated (0), risk (0).\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** The functions are simple string validation and normalization, with no external I/O or malicious patterns. The test functions only verify expected behavior.\n- **Verdict:** The code is safe and benign.\n- **Score adjustments:** Scores are appropriate; malware (0), obfuscated (0), risk (0).\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, the code is utility functions with validation logic, no external or malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Score adjustments:** Scores are appropriate; malware (0), obfuscated (0), risk (0).\n- **Conclusion:** Confirmed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely test functions with hardcoded inputs, no external data or malicious patterns.\n- **Verdict:** Safe, standard unit tests.\n- **Score adjustments:** Appropriate scores; malware (0), obfuscated (0), risk (0).\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior. The code is standard utility and test code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Since there's no malicious activity, no external threats, and the code is purely for validation, the overall security risk is zero.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The entire set of reports correctly identifies that the code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Note:** No further action needed; the supply chain risk here is negligible.",
