{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for resource name normalization and validation, along with associated test functions to verify correctness.",
  "sources": "The functions read input parameters such as resource names and package identifiers; no external data sources or user inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform external system effects; the code is purely computational and validation logic.",
  "flows": "The functions process input parameters through string operations and assertions, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code consists of straightforward string manipulation and validation functions, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions for resource name normalization and validation, accompanied by test functions that verify expected behaviors. It does not interact with external systems, handle untrusted data, or contain malicious patterns. Assertions are used solely for testing correctness. The functions perform simple string processing, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The test cases are static and do not involve external inputs or side effects. Overall, the code is benign, standard, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with associated tests, showing no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe for supply chain use, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
