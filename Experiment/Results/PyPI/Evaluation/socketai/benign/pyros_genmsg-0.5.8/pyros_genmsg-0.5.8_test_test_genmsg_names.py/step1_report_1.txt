{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling resource names and package contexts, primarily for ROS message generation tools.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules (genmsg.names, genmsg) and local test functions. It does not process external inputs or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is written, transmitted, or used insecurely. No data leaks or unsafe operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow is mainly static function definitions and assertions within test functions. No dynamic data flows or untrusted data propagation are observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of utility functions and test cases with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. The license and copyright notices are standard.",
  "analysis": "The script implements straightforward resource name normalization, validation, and composition functions with assertions to verify correctness. No external inputs are processed; the code mainly validates static string values. There are no network operations, system modifications, or security-sensitive operations. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility module focused on resource name validation and formatting. No malicious behavior, security risks, or malware indications are present.",
