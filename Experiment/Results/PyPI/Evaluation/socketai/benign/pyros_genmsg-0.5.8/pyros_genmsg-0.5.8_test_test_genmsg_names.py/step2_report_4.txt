  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign utility module with no external data processing, no network or file I/O, and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The code mainly contains static string manipulation functions and assertions.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as safe and benign. The logic is straightforward, and no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a set of utility functions with no external input or malicious intent.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is purely functional and used for validation.\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the code’s nature. No suspicious activity or malicious patterns are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** The code is utility functions with test functions, validating string processing.\n- **Findings:** No external data, no network operations, no malicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The code is safe, straightforward, and typical for internal validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for resource name validation, with no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a set of validation utilities with no security concerns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** The code is test functions for resource name validation, with no external or malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign test code, safe and straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The code is purely utility and test functions with no network, file, or external data handling.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any reports.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any malicious patterns, external data handling, or security vulnerabilities, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard utility module with associated test functions.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage.\n- The assertions and string manipulations are straightforward and safe.\n- No obfuscation, no external data processing, no network activity.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analyses provided and the nature of the code.",
