      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard pattern for dynamic function creation based on external data. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of 'CHARS' and the implementation of 'draw'. Given the current context, the code is safe, with a low to moderate security risk depending on external data and function implementation."

      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, simple ASCII art utility with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should be 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), mainly due to external data dependency but not malicious. The reports are consistent and accurate."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits minimal malicious activity overall, with some suspicion in Report 2 due to obfuscation and dynamic code patterns. Adjusting the malware score for Report 2 to 0.5 is justified if malicious indicators are confirmed; otherwise, 0.3 remains acceptable. The obfuscation and security risk scores are appropriate. The package should be reviewed further if suspicious patterns are verified."

All reports correctly identify the code as safe, and their scoring aligns with the analysis."

The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0. All reports correctly identify its benign nature; minor adjustments to the risk score are recommended for consistency."
