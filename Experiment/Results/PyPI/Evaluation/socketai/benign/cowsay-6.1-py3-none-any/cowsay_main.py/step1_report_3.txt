{
  "purpose": "The code generates ASCII art with a speech bubble and character figure, resembling a cowsay-style output.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters 'text' and 'char' from function calls; reads character data from the imported '.characters' module.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'print' for console output; raises exceptions for invalid input; returns strings for further use.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is sanitized and processed through generate_bubble and generate_char; 'char' is looked up in CHARS; output is constructed and either printed or returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network activity. Functionality appears solely for ASCII art generation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for creating speech bubbles and ASCII character art, with input validation to prevent empty messages. It imports character data from an external module, which could contain the ASCII character definitions, but these are not included here. The code performs basic string manipulation and printing/returning the ASCII art. No external network access, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detected. The functions raise exceptions for invalid input, but do not process or handle untrusted data beyond this scope. The use of regex and string operations are safe and straightforward. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward ASCII art generator with input validation, no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It only constructs and outputs ASCII characters and speech bubbles. No malware or security risks are present based on the provided code.",
