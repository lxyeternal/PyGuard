{
  "purpose": "The code generates ASCII art speech bubbles with character illustrations, intended for display or retrieval as strings.",
  "sources": "User input text, character selection input, CHARS dictionary data, and optional parameters for output control.",
  "sinks": "Output string or console printing; no direct data sinks leading to external systems or network activity.",
  "flows": "User inputs text and character selection -> functions process input -> generate ASCII art -> output to console or string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code. No use of unsafe functions or external system calls. The only exception is printing to console which is expected behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles string manipulation to create ASCII art speech bubbles with character images. It sanitizes input by stripping whitespace and checks for meaningful input. It uses regular expressions for whitespace removal but does not process or execute untrusted code or data beyond string formatting. No external data sources, network connections, or system modifications are present. The CHARS dictionary is assumed to contain static data. No malicious patterns or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward ASCII art generator with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not handle sensitive data or perform insecure operations. The only potential concern is if user input is extremely large, but that is a normal usage scenario and not inherently malicious.",
