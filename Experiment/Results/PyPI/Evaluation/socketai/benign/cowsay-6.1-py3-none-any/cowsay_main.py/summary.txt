  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, simple ASCII art utility with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should be 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), mainly due to external data dependency but not malicious. The reports are consistent and accurate."
