  "purpose": "Generate ASCII art speech bubbles with characters, for console display or as strings.",
  "sources": "Input text, character name, external CHARS data for ASCII art characters.",
  "sinks": "Console output via print, or returned string containing ASCII art.",
  "flows": "Input text and character key -> validation -> ASCII art bubble and character generation -> output to console or string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward ASCII art generator, performing input validation, string manipulation, and output formatting. It imports character ASCII art from an external module, which is assumed to be static data. There are no network operations, system commands, or data leaks. The functions are simple and do not process untrusted data beyond formatting. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The external CHARS data dependency is benign and typical for such utilities. The code raises errors on empty input and invalid characters, ensuring basic validation. Overall, the code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, simple ASCII art utility with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should be 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), mainly due to external data dependency but not malicious. The reports are consistent and accurate.",
