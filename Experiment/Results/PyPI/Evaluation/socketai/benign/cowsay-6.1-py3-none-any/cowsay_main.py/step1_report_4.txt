{
  "purpose": "This code generates an ASCII art speech bubble with a character illustration, likely for a command-line tool similar to 'cowsay'.",
  "sources": "Input text from function parameters 'text' and 'char', data from imported modules (e.g., CHARS), user-provided character name.",
  "sinks": "Output string or printed lines; potential for code injection via malicious input affecting output formatting, though unlikely here as input is directly used for display only.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows into 'draw' function, which processes and passes it to 'generate_bubble'. 'char' input is used to fetch character lines from CHARS, then combined to produce the ASCII art output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Use of regex for whitespace check is safe. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated parts. The only notable point is reliance on external CHARS data, but this is normal for such utilities.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions for generating ASCII speech bubbles and characters, then combines them for display. It raises an exception if the input text is empty or whitespace. It validates character input against a dictionary, raising an error if invalid. No code injections, data leaks, or malicious network activity are present. The code appears to be a standard ASCII art generator with no suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign ASCII art utility for command-line display, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs input validation and uses data for formatting only, with no external system calls or insecure operations.",
