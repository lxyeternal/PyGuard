{
  "purpose": "This code generates ASCII art 'cowsay' style speech bubbles with character illustrations, intended for visual output in console or as string.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'text' argument in 'draw' and 'get_output_string', and from the 'char_lines' argument in 'generate_char'. It also accesses the 'CHARS' dictionary imported from another module.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to console via 'print' in 'draw' or returns a string, but does not write to files, send network requests, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Input text is sanitized and split in 'draw', passed to 'generate_bubble' and 'generate_char' for ASCII generation. 'get_output_string' retrieves character data from 'CHARS' and calls 'draw' to produce output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activities are present. The code does not execute any system commands, manipulate environment variables, or perform data exfiltration. It relies on external 'CHARS' data which appears to be ASCII art definitions. The code structure is straightforward and typical for ASCII art generation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides ASCII art speech bubble generation with characters, using simple string operations and regular expressions for input validation. The 'CHARS' dictionary supplies character representations, and the functions assemble and output ASCII images. There are no indications of obfuscated code, malicious data handling, or security vulnerabilities such as code injection or data leaks. It is a self-contained ASCII art utility with standard input validation and error handling for empty input or invalid character requests.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign ASCII art generator with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply processes input text and character data to produce visual output, with proper input validation and error handling.",
