  "purpose": "Unit tests for the cowsay Python package to verify character names, error handling, and output string generation.",
  "sources": "Input data includes string literals for characters, error triggers, and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and exception handling are used internally; no untrusted data sources or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke cowsay functions with controlled inputs; no untrusted data flows to external systems or sensitive data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The tests are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit testing of the cowsay module functions. It validates character list ordering, error conditions, and output types. All operations are within controlled test environments with no external data dependencies or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for testing purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard validation of the cowsay library functions.",
