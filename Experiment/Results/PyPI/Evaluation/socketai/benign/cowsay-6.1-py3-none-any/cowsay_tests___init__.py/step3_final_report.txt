  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic code execution, hardcoded strings, obfuscated code segments, network communication points, input data handling.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variable access, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input data or untrusted strings → suspicious functions (eval, exec, hardcoded URLs) → network/file sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious dynamic execution, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials or endpoints, unclear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are suspicious. No explicit malicious payloads or backdoors are confirmed, but the presence of suspicious strings and obfuscation raises concern. The majority of reports indicate benign behavior with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 2 suggests some suspicion; increasing malware score from 0.3 to 0.5 would better reflect the potential risk if malicious indicators are confirmed. Other reports are consistent with benign code. Overall, the evidence points to moderate concern primarily centered on Report 2.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits minimal malicious activity overall, with some suspicion in Report 2 due to obfuscation and dynamic code patterns. Adjusting the malware score for Report 2 to 0.5 is justified if malicious indicators are confirmed; otherwise, 0.3 remains acceptable. The obfuscation and security risk scores are appropriate. The package should be reviewed further if suspicious patterns are verified.",
