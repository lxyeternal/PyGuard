  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits minimal malicious activity overall, with some suspicion in Report 2 due to obfuscation and dynamic code patterns. Adjusting the malware score for Report 2 to 0.5 is justified if malicious indicators are confirmed; otherwise, 0.3 remains acceptable. The obfuscation and security risk scores are appropriate. The package should be reviewed further if suspicious patterns are verified."
