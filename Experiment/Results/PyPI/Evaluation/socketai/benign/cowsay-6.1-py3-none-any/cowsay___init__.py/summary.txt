  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard pattern for dynamic function creation based on external data. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of 'CHARS' and the implementation of 'draw'. Given the current context, the code is safe, with a low to moderate security risk depending on external data and function implementation."
