  "purpose": "CLI tool to display text in ASCII art using different character styles.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for character and text input, specifically from sys.argv via argparse.",
  "sinks": "Calls a character function from char_funcs with the input text, which may produce output or perform further actions.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments flows into character validation and then into the corresponding character function call.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscated code. No external network connections or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI interface that validates user input against predefined character names and executes a function accordingly. It uses argparse to handle input parameters, ensures the character is valid, and then invokes the associated function with the input text. No external data sources, network activity, or sensitive operations are evident. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical CLI pattern usage. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI utility for ASCII art display with no malicious intent or security concerns. It only processes user input and calls predefined functions without any suspicious operations.",
