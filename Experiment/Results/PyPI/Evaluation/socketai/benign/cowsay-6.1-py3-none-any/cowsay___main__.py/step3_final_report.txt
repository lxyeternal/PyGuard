  "purpose": "CLI tool to display text in ASCII art using predefined character styles.",
  "sources": "User input for character selection and text, validated against 'char_names'.",
  "sinks": "Function call 'char_funcs[args.character](args.text)' which processes the text for ASCII art output.",
  "flows": "Input is validated against 'char_names' then passed directly to 'char_funcs' for processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that parses arguments, validates character input, and calls an external function to generate ASCII art. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The external functions are assumed benign ASCII art generators. Validation prevents invalid characters. No network activity or data leaks are present. The code structure is standard and secure for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured CLI ASCII art generator with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The external functions are presumed safe, and the validation ensures proper input handling. The overall security risk is negligible.",
