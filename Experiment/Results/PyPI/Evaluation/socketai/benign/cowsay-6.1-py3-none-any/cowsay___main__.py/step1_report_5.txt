  "purpose": "CLI tool to display text in ASCII art using specified character sets",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments '--character' and '--text'",
  "sinks": "Calls character functions with user-provided text, potentially executing code in character functions",
  "flows": "Input args -> validation -> character function call with text",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious imports or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code defines a command-line interface for a text display tool. It reads user inputs for character and text, validates the character against predefined options, and invokes the associated character function with the user-provided text. The logic is straightforward and standard for CLI applications. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or code injection. The functions invoked are external and not shown, but their usage appears to be typical for ASCII art rendering. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI interface for ASCII art display with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external character functions for output. Overall, it appears safe and free of malware.",
