{
  "purpose": "A command-line interface (CLI) tool to display text as ASCII art with different character styles.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for character selection and text input.",
  "sinks": "Uses the selected character function to process the input text.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are validated against character names, then the corresponding function is called with the input text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code. No use of unsafe functions or obfuscated code. The functions called are from imported modules and are not shown, but their usage appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, using argparse to parse inputs. It validates the character against predefined names and invokes a function with the text. No data is sent over network, nor are there any suspicious or malicious operations observed within this snippet. The imported modules and functions are not detailed, but based on this code alone, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a CLI for ASCII art display with input validation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided content.",
