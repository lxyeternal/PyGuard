  "purpose": "CLI tool to display text in ASCII art using different characters.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments: --character, --text, and --version.",
  "sinks": "Calls character functions with user-supplied text; no direct data leaks or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "User input (--character and --text) flows into validation and then into character functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; straightforward argument parsing and function calls.",
  "analysis": "The code uses argparse to accept user input, validating character choice against predefined options, then invokes a corresponding function with user text. No data is sent over the network, no system modification, and no suspicious behavior is evident. It is a standard CLI pattern with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate CLI utility for ASCII art display. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code is simple, well-structured, and safe based on the provided snippet.",
