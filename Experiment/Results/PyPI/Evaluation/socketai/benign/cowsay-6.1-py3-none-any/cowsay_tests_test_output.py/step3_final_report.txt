{
  "purpose": "The code is a pytest-based test suite that verifies the output of cowsay character functions against predefined solutions by capturing stdout and comparing processed output.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from a hardcoded string ('lorem') and imports functions from the 'cowsay' library and solutions module.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to sys.stdout during function execution, but only for testing purposes; no untrusted data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Input string 'lorem' flows into character functions from 'cowsay', which output to stdout; this output is captured and compared to stored solutions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present; the code is straightforward and standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign test suite that invokes character functions, captures their output, and compares it to expected solutions. It uses standard libraries and testing practices without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. No suspicious patterns or malicious code are detected. The data flow is simple and contained within the test environment. The code's purpose is verification, and it does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard testing script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with its benign nature. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, and their scoring aligns with the analysis.",
