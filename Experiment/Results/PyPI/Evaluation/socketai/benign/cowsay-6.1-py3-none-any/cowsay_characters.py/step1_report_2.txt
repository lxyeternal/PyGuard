  "purpose": "Definition of ASCII art string constants representing various characters, possibly for use as visual assets or embedded in other code.",
  "sources": "Constant dictionary assignment to variable 'CHARS', containing ASCII art strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or data processing observed; no sinks where untrusted data leads to security impact.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely data initialization without processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; ASCII art is static data.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines a dictionary 'CHARS' with multiple keys mapping to multi-line raw string ASCII art. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or input/output operations. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or code injection vectors are present. As this is static data, there is no malicious behavior. The ASCII art strings do not contain code or executable content; they are just visual representations. Overall, the code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a static dictionary of ASCII art characters, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be harmless data definitions intended for visual display or embedding. There are no sources or sinks that involve untrusted data or execution, and no anomalies or obfuscation detected.",
