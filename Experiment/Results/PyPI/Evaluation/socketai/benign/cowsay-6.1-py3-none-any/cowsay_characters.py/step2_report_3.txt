  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a static dictionary of ASCII art strings stored in `CHARS`.\n   - No external inputs, dynamic code, or executable logic are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n   - The code is purely data, intended for display or embedding purposes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - No significant errors or logical flaws are evident in the summaries.\n   - All reports consistently interpret the code as benign static data.\n   - The assessments are aligned with the code's nature.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the static, harmless nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any risk that would justify a higher score.\n   - The code contains only ASCII art strings, with no executable or sensitive content.\n   - The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - Since the code is static ASCII art, there's no malware activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and stick to factual analysis.\n   - They correctly conclude the code is benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a static collection of ASCII art strings with no dynamic behavior, external inputs, or executable content. It does not contain any malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. The ASCII art is harmless and purely decorative.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, benign, and carries no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nIf I were to assign my own scores based on the analysis, I would concur with the reports:  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the static, harmless nature of the data.",
