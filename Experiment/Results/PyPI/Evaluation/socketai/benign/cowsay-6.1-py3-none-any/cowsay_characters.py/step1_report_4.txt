{
  "purpose": "This code defines a dictionary containing multiple ASCII art representations associated with different character names.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string data from the dictionary keys and values; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, system modifications, or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only initializes and stores static string data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code consists solely of ASCII art definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of string literals stored in a dictionary, with no functions, no external data input, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. All strings are static ASCII art images, and no operations or code behaviors suggest malicious intent. The absence of executable logic, input/output operations, or external dependencies indicates a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward static data definition containing ASCII art representations. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
