{
  "purpose": "This code defines a collection of ASCII art strings stored in a dictionary named CHARS, likely for display purposes within an application.",
  "sources": "The data is hardcoded within the dictionary; no external input sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static data assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hidden code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code consists solely of ASCII art string definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of string assignments within a dictionary. No functions, external inputs, or dynamic code execution are present. The data appears to be static ASCII art for visual display. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is structured cleanly and straightforwardly, with no unusual language features or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static collection of ASCII art strings with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior detected. It is safe and purely informational or decorative.",
