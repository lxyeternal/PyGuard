{
  "purpose": "The code defines a static dictionary 'CHARS' containing ASCII art strings for various characters, intended for display or decorative purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded string literals within the 'CHARS' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or output data that could lead to leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the data is static and self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with static ASCII art, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution, and no embedded malicious content.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a dictionary with ASCII art strings. No functions, external inputs, or executable code are present. All reports correctly identify the static, benign nature of the data. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static collection of ASCII art strings with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scoring in all reports accurately reflects this assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
