{
  "purpose": "This code defines a dictionary mapping animal or character names to ASCII art strings. It appears to be intended for use as a collection of ASCII art templates or assets within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The data is statically embedded in the dictionary values; no external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external data manipulation are present; all data is hardcoded.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code consists solely of static string assignments.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive ASCII art, which is unusual for a typical dependency but does not exhibit malicious activity. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static dictionary mapping keys to ASCII art strings. It does not include any functions, dynamic code execution, or data manipulation. All entries are static string literals. The ASCII art itself is benign, containing no code or payloads. The structure and content suggest it is purely decorative or for user interface purposes. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. There is no evidence of malware or security risks within this module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign collection of ASCII art strings stored in a dictionary. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended for aesthetic or illustrative purposes within a larger project.",
