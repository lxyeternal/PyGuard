{
  "purpose": "This code defines a dictionary named CHARS_SOLUTIONS mapping string keys to ASCII art string values, likely for display or aesthetic purposes in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only from the static dictionary keys and string values; no external input or data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the static dictionary definitions to potential display functions; no data transformations or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code consists solely of static string definitions with ASCII art, and no executable code or dynamic execution logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a static dictionary with ASCII art representations mapped to keys. There are no functions, input handling, or executable statements; it appears to be purely data storage. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or sabotage are observed. The code does not perform any actions that could harm or compromise a system. Its structure is straightforward and static.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a static asset repository for ASCII art. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected. The ASCII art data is static, with no dynamic or executable components.",
