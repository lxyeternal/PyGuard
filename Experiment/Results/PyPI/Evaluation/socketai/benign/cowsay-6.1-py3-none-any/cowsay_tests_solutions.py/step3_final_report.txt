  "purpose": "Static storage of ASCII art representations associated with character or theme names, serving decorative or aesthetic purposes.",
  "sources": "The dictionary keys and values are static string assignments; no external input or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No data flows to external systems, outputs, or untrusted sinks; the code is purely static data.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows; the ASCII art strings are directly assigned and accessed as static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward static ASCII art.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a dictionary mapping string identifiers to multi-line ASCII art strings. It contains no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The ASCII art is purely decorative, with no embedded code, payloads, or obfuscated segments. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk) are all zero or near-zero, aligning with the static, benign nature of the data. The ASCII art does not contain embedded secrets or malicious payloads, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The overall assessment confirms that the code is safe and purely decorative, with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static data comprising ASCII art strings, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening components. The current scores and assessments are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
