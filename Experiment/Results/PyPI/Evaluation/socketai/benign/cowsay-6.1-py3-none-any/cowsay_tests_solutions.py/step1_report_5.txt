{
  "purpose": "This code defines a dictionary containing multiple ASCII art representations associated with string keys, likely for use as visual components or assets in an application or game.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a static dictionary named CHARS_SOLUTIONS, which is hardcoded and does not accept external input.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks, as the data is statically embedded within the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily consists of static ASCII art strings; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are detected. No functions, input handling, or network activity are included.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static dictionary assignment containing ASCII art strings keyed by descriptive names. No functions, user inputs, or external interactions are present. The ASCII art appears to be benign decorative content. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or complex logic. The purpose seems to be asset storage rather than executable logic. The beginning, middle, and end of the code are consistent and free of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static asset repository of ASCII art, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely decorative content stored in a Python dictionary, with no dynamic or external operations involved.",
