{
  "purpose": "This code defines a dictionary mapping character names to ASCII art strings, intended for display or decoration within a larger application.",
  "sources": "No external input, data, or user input is read or processed in this code.",
  "sinks": "No output, data leakage, or untrusted data handling occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static data assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code solely contains static ASCII art strings assigned to dictionary entries.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single dictionary 'CHARS_SOLUTIONS' with multiple keys, each mapped to a multi-line raw string containing ASCII art. No functions, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution are present. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behavior is detectable. The purpose appears to be to store visual assets for display purposes, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, purely static data with ASCII art illustrations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks in this code fragment.",
