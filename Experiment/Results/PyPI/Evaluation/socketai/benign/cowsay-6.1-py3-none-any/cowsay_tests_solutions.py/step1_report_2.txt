{
  "purpose": "The code defines a dictionary containing ASCII art strings associated with different themes or characters.",
  "sources": "The entire data structure is a static dictionary with no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data transmission, file writing, or environment variable access are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only initializes a data structure.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious operations. The ASCII art appears benign and unrelated to malicious activities.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a dictionary with ASCII art strings assigned as raw string literals to specific keys. There are no functions, input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The data appears to serve as static content, likely for display purposes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static dictionary containing ASCII art, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any operations or data transmission, thus posing no security threat.",
