  "purpose": "Define type literals for the CodeGuru Profiler service and other AWS service identifiers for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions assigned to variables like ActionGroupType, AgentParameterFieldType, etc.",
  "sinks": "None observed. The code only defines constants; it does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is present, as this code only declares type annotations and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code contains standard type annotations, conditional import for compatibility, and extensive AWS service string literals. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses conditional import to ensure compatibility across Python versions, which is standard practice. It defines numerous Literal types representing AWS service names and other related constants for type safety. The extensive list of service names appears to be for comprehensive coverage of AWS services, used solely for type annotations. There is no evidence of malicious code, external data processing, or suspicious behavior. The code is purely declarative, serving as a constants module for type hints.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign type annotation module defining string literal types for AWS service identifiers and related constants. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
