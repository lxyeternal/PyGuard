  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literal types used in the codeguruprofiler service for type safety and clarity.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for string types such as ActionGroupType, AgentParameterFieldType, and ServiceName, primarily in variable assignments and imports.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data sources; the code only defines type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; purely static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code includes standard type alias definitions, conditional import for compatibility, and extensive string literal types. No obfuscated or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code starts with a documentation string describing its purpose, including licensing info and usage example. It imports sys and conditionally imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version, which is a common compatibility pattern. The bulk of the code defines multiple type aliases using Literal with fixed string values. The list of literals for ServiceName and ResourceServiceName are extensive but straightforward. No code executes dynamic logic, network calls, or data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured type definitions module meant for static type checking in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a straightforward static type definitions module for boto3 service literals, with no evident malicious or obfuscated elements.",
