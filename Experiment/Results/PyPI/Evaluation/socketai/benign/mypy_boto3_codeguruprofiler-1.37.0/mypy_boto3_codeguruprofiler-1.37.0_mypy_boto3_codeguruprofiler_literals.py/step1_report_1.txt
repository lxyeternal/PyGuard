  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS CodeGuru Profiler service and other AWS service identifiers for type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading the module's own literal definitions, conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version, and the docstring.",
  "sinks": "No actual data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code purely declares literals without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns. The license header incorrectly states 'Copyright 2025', which is a future year but likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious. The import of 'sys' and conditional import of 'Literal' are standard for compatibility. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of type literal definitions for AWS service identifiers, with a compatible import for Python versions <3.12. The docstring provides documentation link and usage example. No functions, input handling, or data processing present. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or potential malicious behavior. The only potential concern is the future year in the copyright statement, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious. Overall, the code is standard type annotation definitions with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely defining string literal types for type checking and documentation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The only minor anomaly is the future year in the copyright statement, which appears to be a typo.",
