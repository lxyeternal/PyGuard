  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS CodeGuru Profiler and other AWS services.",
  "sources": "Static literal definitions, conditional import, documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external output.",
  "flows": "None; purely static type alias declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Future year '2025' in copyright, likely a placeholder or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using Literal for AWS service identifiers. No dynamic code, data processing, network calls, or secrets are present. The conditional import ensures compatibility across Python versions. The extensive lists of service names are consistent with a type annotations module. The only minor anomaly is the future year in the copyright statement, which is probably a placeholder and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, static set of type definitions for AWS service identifiers, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The only notable issue is the placeholder year, which does not impact security.",
