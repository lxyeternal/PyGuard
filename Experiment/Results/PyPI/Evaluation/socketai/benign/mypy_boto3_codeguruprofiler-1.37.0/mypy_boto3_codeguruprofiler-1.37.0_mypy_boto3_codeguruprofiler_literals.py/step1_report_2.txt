  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS CodeGuru Profiler service configurations and general AWS service identifiers to be used with type checking.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and typing (conditional based on Python version).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; this is a static type definitions module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of type alias declarations and imports with no dynamic or suspicious code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type aliases for AWS-specific string literals, facilitating static type checking in Python projects. It uses conditional imports to support different Python versions, which is standard. No external input handling, data processing, or network operations are present. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The content appears to be a benign, purely informational module for type annotations. The inclusion of a copyright statement and documentation link suggests an intended, legitimate purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static type alias module for AWS service literals, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
