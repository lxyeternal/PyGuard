  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS service and parameter identifiers used in type annotations within the boto3_stubs library for CodeGuru Profiler.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.version_info check, and literal type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely type annotation definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns. The code is standard for type definitions and documentation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes type aliases for literals using the Literal type, conditionally importing 'Literal' based on Python version. It includes extensive service name lists for AWS SDK references, likely generated or maintained for type safety and documentation. No dynamic code execution, external network activity, or data manipulation occurs. The presence of copyright info and documentation links suggests open-source intent. Overall, the code is straightforward, serving as type definitions without any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of type annotations for AWS service identifiers used in boto3 stubs. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
