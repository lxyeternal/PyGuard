  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A, static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025), likely a placeholder or oversight.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string to __version__, with only a comment and a copyright notice. No inputs, external data, dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The only anomaly is the future year (2025), which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No further analysis or modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and the only noted anomaly (future year) is non-malicious. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
