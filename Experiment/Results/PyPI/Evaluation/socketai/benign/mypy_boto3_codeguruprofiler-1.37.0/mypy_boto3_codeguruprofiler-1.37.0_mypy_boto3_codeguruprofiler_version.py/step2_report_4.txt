  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings to the actual code snippet:\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a simple assignment: `__version__ = \"1.37.0\"`.\n- It contains only a comment, a copyright notice, and a version string assignment.\n- No inputs, external data, dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n- The only anomaly noted is the future year (2025) in the copyright comment, which is likely a placeholder or oversight, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and benign.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports correctly identify the code as a simple version declaration with no security concerns. They also note the future date as an anomaly but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk as 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  Since the code is just a static assignment with no malicious activity, a malware score of 0 is justified across all reports.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated. Scores of 0 are correct.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  The risk score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Anomalies:**  \n  The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not malicious.\n\n- **Potential for assumptions:**  \n  All reports avoid assumptions and correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Adjustments to scores:**  \n  No adjustments needed; all scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n- **Overall assessment:**  \n  The code is a standard version declaration with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only minor anomaly (future year) is non-malicious and does not impact security. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and contains no security risks or malicious intent.",
