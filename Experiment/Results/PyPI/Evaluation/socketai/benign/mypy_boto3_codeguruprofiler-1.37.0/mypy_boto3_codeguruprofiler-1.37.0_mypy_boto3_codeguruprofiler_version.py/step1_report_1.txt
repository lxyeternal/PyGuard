  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright notice with a future date (2025) which may indicate a placeholder or inconsistency, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to a variable and includes a copyright comment. There are no inputs, no processing, no external data handling. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The future copyright year appears unusual but does not impact security; it might be a placeholder or oversight.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues detected. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely non-malicious.",
