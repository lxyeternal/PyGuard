  "purpose": "Define and expose the version number of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The string assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external data flows.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only assigns a static string to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a comment about the source of truth for version and a copyright notice. The only executable statement is the assignment of a static version string to __version__. No input handling, no external data reading, and no dynamic code execution. The code is minimal and standard for version declaration in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves solely to define a version string for the package or module. There are no security risks, malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior present.",
