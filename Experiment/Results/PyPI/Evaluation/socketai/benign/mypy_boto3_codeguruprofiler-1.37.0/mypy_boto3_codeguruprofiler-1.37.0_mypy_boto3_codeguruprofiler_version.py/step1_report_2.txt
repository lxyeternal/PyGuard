  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module, serving as a source of truth for versioning.",
  "sources": "The __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A - simple assignment, no data flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any unusual code, dynamic execution, or obfuscation; straightforward version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a license comment, a copyright notice, and a single assignment of a version string to __version__. No input handling, external data access, or code execution occurs. The code is very minimal and standard for version declaration. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or security risks are present. The overall structure and content are benign and typical for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. It serves as a source of truth for package versioning, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
