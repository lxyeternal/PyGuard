  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the variable `__version__`. It includes only a comment and a copyright notice with a future year (2025). There are no inputs, no external data, no dynamic code, and no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. The code is minimal and standard for version declaration. No malicious code, data flows, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no security risks or malicious behavior. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a placeholder or oversight, not malicious.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All reports assign `malware` = 0, `securityRisk` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and high confidence scores (mostly 1). These are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Specific observations:\n\n1. **Malware Score:**  \n   All reports assign 0, which is correct. No malicious activity detected.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Score:**  \n   All assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n3. **Security Risk Score:**  \n   All assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Anomalies:**  \n   The only noted anomaly is the future year (2025). This is not security-relevant but could be a placeholder or typo. It does not impact security or malware assessment.\n\n5. **Reasoning and conclusions:**  \n   All reports correctly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores:**  \n  The scores are reasonable and consistent across reports. No changes needed.\n\n- **Additional considerations:**  \n  The only minor point is that the future year might be updated for accuracy, but it doesn't affect security assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**  \n\nThe code is a standard version declaration with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
