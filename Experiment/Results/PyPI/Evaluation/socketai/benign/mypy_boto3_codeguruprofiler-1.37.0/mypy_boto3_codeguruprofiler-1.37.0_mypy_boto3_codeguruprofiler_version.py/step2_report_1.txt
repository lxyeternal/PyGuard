  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No inputs, external data, dynamic code, or obfuscation are present.\n- The only anomaly noted is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a placeholder or oversight, not malicious.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- Security risk scores are 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n**Confirming the code:**\n- The code snippet provided is exactly the same as the \"sources\" described in each report.\n- There are no hidden or malicious constructs; it’s a minimal, standard version declaration.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior.\n- The only minor point is the future copyright year, which might be a placeholder but is not security-relevant.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n- No assumptions are made that could lead to false positives.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a simple, static version declaration with no malicious intent.\n- The malware score remains at 0.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n- The risk score should stay at 0, given the benign nature.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll evidence points to this being a benign, standard version declaration. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the future copyright year is unusual, it doesn't impact security. If anything, it suggests a placeholder or oversight rather than malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe and standard.\n- No changes needed to scores.\n- The overall risk remains negligible.\n\n**End of analysis.**",
