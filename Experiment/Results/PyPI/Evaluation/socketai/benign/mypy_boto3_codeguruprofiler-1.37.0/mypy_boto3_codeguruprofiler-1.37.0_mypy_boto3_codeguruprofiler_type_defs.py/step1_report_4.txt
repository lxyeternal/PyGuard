{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for the CodeGuru Profiler service in Python, facilitating type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, botocore.response, and local literals; type definitions and data structures for the service.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are present; only type definitions and imports.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules and literals into type definitions; no runtime data flow or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No obfuscated code, runtime code execution, or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of structured type definitions using TypedDict and Union, with conditional imports for compatibility. No runtime logic, no data handling, or untrusted input processing is implemented. The code is straightforward and appears solely for type hinting and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of type annotations for the CodeGuru Profiler SDK, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It simply facilitates static typing and documentation.",
