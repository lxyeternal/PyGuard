{
  "purpose": "This code provides type definitions for the boto3 CodeGuru Profiler service, facilitating type hints and data validation for interactions with the service API.",
  "sources": "Type definitions and data structures, mainly involving constants, class-based dictionaries, and type annotations; no external or user input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication via StreamingBody in get_profile, and possible data leaks through ResponseMetadata and profile data; no direct untrusted data processing is observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from data sources like get_profile (StreamingBody) to sinks such as data serialization or network transmission; internal flow is limited to data structures passing between functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident. The code primarily consists of data structure definitions with standard type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines data types and constants used for API interactions with the CodeGuru Profiler service. It includes version-dependent imports and a comprehensive set of TypedDict classes for structured data. There are no dynamic code executions, input parsing, or network operations within this code segment. The presence of type annotations and standard library usage indicates good practices. No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured set of type definitions intended for type hinting and validation. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal, with no malicious activity detected.",
