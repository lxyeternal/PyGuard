  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Describes type definitions and documentation for the CodeGuru Profiler SDK. No executable code or runtime logic.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard type stub definitions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Conclusion:** Fully aligned with the code content.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type definitions for the SDK.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no external commands, no malicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** Standard type annotations, compatibility imports, no runtime logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly reflects the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Type definitions involving data handling, including StreamingBody, ResponseMetadata, and potential data leaks.\n- **Findings:** While potential data leaks are noted (e.g., profile data, response metadata), no actual malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The mention of data leaks is about the potential exposure of data during legitimate SDK operations, not malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Justification for risk score:** Given that this code involves data structures that could be used to handle sensitive data, the low risk score is justified. No malicious code is present, just standard data definitions.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Type annotations and documentation for the SDK.\n- **Findings:** No runtime logic, no external data sources, no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** Purely structural, with version compatibility considerations.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Conclusion:** Fully aligned with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Type definitions for API requests/responses, no runtime logic.\n- **Findings:** No external untrusted input processing, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Structural, documentation-oriented code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent with the code content.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is straightforward type annotations.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero only in Report 3 (0.1), justified by potential data exposure, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The current scores are appropriate given the nature of the code—pure type definitions with no runtime logic or malicious patterns.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward type annotations)\n- **Risk:** 0 (minimal, justified by data handling potential but not malicious)\n\nThis code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK, with no security concerns.",
