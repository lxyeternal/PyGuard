{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and documentation for the boto3 CodeGuru Profiler SDK, defining data structures and response types.",
  "sources": "Type definitions, import statements, and documentation comments; no runtime code or external data handling.",
  "sinks": "None; data structures may handle sensitive data during actual SDK operation, but no malicious data flow or exfiltration is present.",
  "flows": "Static type definitions serve as data schemas; no executable or dynamic data flow occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations, import compatibility handling, and documentation. It references data types like StreamingBody and ResponseMetadata, which are standard in AWS SDKs. No executable logic, external command execution, or data processing is present. The minimal security concern arises from the potential handling of sensitive data in responses, but this is inherent to SDK data structures and not malicious. The code's purpose is purely structural, serving as type hints for static analysis and IDE support.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, well-structured set of type definitions for the boto3 CodeGuru Profiler SDK. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and justified.",
