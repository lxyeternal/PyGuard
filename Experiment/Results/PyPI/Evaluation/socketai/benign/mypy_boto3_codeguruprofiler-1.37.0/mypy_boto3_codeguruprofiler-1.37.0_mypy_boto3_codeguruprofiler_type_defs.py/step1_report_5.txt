  "purpose": "Type definitions for the CodeGuru Profiler service SDK, providing structured type hints for API requests and responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, type annotations, and imported constants and types. No external untrusted input sources are explicitly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if sensitive data is exposed via string representations or logs, but no such sinks are present. No system commands, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are found.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, as this code solely defines types and data structures, without executing logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily consists of type definitions using TypedDict and Union; no suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be standard, auto-generated type annotations for a boto3 client.",
  "analysis": "The code provides detailed type definitions for API requests and responses of the CodeGuru Profiler SDK, with careful handling of version compatibility. It includes a comprehensive set of data structures, but no executable logic or external data reading mechanisms. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is purely structural and documentation-oriented.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of type annotations for a Python SDK, with no malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks identified. It serves as type hints and documentation for API interactions, which is common and safe.",
