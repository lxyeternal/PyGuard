{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and documentation for the boto3 CodeGuru Profiler service, facilitating type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Reads input from package imports, standard libraries, and external modules; defines type aliases and data structures.",
  "sinks": "Uses data structures that could potentially store or handle untrusted data, such as input parameters and responses, but no direct sinks for executing untrusted code or external commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (function parameters, request data) through type definitions to responses and data structures; no execution or data processing flow indicating malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code appears to be standard type annotation definitions for AWS SDK responses, with no obfuscated code or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily composed of type definitions (TypedDict, Union, etc.) used for static typing support. It includes conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility. No dynamic code execution, external command calls, or data leaks are present. The structure aligns with standard SDK modeling, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical set of type annotations and documentation for an SDK, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, straightforward, and appears to be intended solely for type safety and clarity.",
