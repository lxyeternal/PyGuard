  "purpose": "Type definitions and documentation for the codeguruprofiler service in the boto3-stubs package, facilitating type safety and code completion for Python SDK usage.",
  "sources": "Reading package documentation, import statements, type annotations, and code comments.",
  "sinks": "None detected. The code is mainly type definitions with no runtime logic or data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present since this is purely type declaration code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains standard type annotations and documentation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type aliases, TypedDict definitions, conditional imports for compatibility, and documentation comments. There are no executable code blocks, data processing, or runtime logic. The code adheres to standard Python typing practices, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The structure and content are consistent with open-source type stub files for a Python SDK, and no suspicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of type definitions and documentation for a Python SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, well-structured, and safe.",
