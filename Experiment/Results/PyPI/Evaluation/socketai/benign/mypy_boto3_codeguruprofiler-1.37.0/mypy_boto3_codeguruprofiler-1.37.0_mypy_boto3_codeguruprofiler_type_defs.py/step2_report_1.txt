  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clear; type definitions and documentation for SDK.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No executable code, no secrets, no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct; code is standard type stub.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully justified. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; standard type annotations.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no malicious patterns, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct; it's a typical SDK type definition file.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type definitions for API interactions, including StreamingBody, ResponseMetadata, etc.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** Potential data leak through data structures like `StreamingBody` and response metadata, but no dynamic code or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** These are data structure definitions for SDK responses; no execution or data exfiltration occurs here.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct; no malicious intent, just data type definitions.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 — possibly slightly high, but given the data structures, it's acceptable as a minimal concern.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations, no runtime logic.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct; purely type annotations.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Structural type hints for API requests/responses.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No runtime logic, no external command execution, no secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct; purely data structure definitions.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is a set of static type definitions, with no executable logic, no malicious code, and no obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the content.\n- The only minor point is the small security risk score (0.1) in Report 3, which is acceptable given the inclusion of data structures that could potentially leak data if misused, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0** — no malicious code detected.  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0** — no real security risk; only minimal concern over data exposure in response structures, which is standard in SDK type definitions.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
