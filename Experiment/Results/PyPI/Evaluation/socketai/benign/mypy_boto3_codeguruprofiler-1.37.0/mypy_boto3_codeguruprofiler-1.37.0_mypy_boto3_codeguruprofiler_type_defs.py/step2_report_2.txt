  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code, potential security implications, and consistency of the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type definitions and documentation for the SDK; no runtime logic.\n- **Analysis:** The code is purely static type annotations, no data processing or execution.\n- **Anomalies & Suspicious Activity:** None observed.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard type stub code.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring is appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1, focusing on type definitions.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, no data flow, no malicious constructs.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard SDK type annotations, safe.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are justified and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type definitions, with some potential data handling via StreamingBody.\n- **Analysis:** While it references data that could be transmitted over the network (e.g., `StreamingBody`), the code itself only defines types; no runtime logic, no data processing.\n- **Potential concern:** The presence of `StreamingBody` could be a sink if misused, but in this context, it's part of type definitions for responses.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, primarily static type definitions.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Security risk: 0.1 (minimal, due to potential data exposure in actual runtime, but no malicious activity)\n\n**Recommendation:** The security risk score of 0.1 is reasonable, reflecting minimal concern about data leaks in real usage, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations for SDK, no runtime logic.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, no data flow, no suspicious constructs.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard type definitions.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others, defining types for API requests/responses.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime code, no external data handling, just static types.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are correctly 0; code is straightforward, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly higher in report 3 (0.1) due to the mention of `StreamingBody`, which could be a sink in runtime but is not malicious in itself. The other reports correctly assign 0.\n\n### Final justification:\n\n- The code is purely static type definitions, documentation, and imports.\n- No executable code, data processing, or external commands.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The presence of `StreamingBody` is a standard AWS SDK type, not malicious.\n- The minimal security risk score in report 3 is justified, considering potential data exposure in real runtime, but no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports — accurate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all — accurate.\n- **Risk score:** 0 for reports 1, 2, 4, 5; 0.1 for report 3 — justified.\n\n**Overall, the assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.**",
