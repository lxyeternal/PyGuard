  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), which outputs version info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that prints package info or version based on input. It only writes predefined static strings to stdout and reads command-line args. No external data sources, network connections, or sensitive data handling observed. No malicious or suspicious activity present. The code is simple, well-structured, and lacks any indicators of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as a CLI info tool, and does not contain malware or security risks.",
