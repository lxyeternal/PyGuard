  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on a command-line argument.\n   - It does not perform any network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The functions `print_info()` and `print_version()` simply write predefined strings to stdout.\n   - The argument check (`\"--version\" in sys.argv`) is straightforward.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are observed.\n   - No external data fetching, network connections, or data exfiltration.\n   - The code is simple, transparent, and serves an informational purpose.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct, no obfuscation)\n     - **Malware:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n     - **Security risk:** 0 (appropriate, as the code is benign)\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and benign.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis aligns with the code's simplicity.\n   - The reports do not overstate the risk or suggest malicious intent.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely informational and has no malicious or obfuscated elements, the malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The security risk score should also stay at 0, given the benign nature.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard CLI utility for displaying static package info.\n   - No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The reports are thorough and correctly identify the benign nature.\n- No changes needed in scoring or analysis.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, safe CLI utility with no security risks or malware. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
