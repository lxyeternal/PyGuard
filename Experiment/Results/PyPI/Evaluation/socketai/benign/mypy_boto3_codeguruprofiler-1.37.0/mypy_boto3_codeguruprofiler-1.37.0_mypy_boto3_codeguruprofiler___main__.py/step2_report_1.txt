  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation**:  \n   The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments. It does not fetch external data, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. The code matches the described purpose in all reports.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:  \n   All reports agree that there are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is straightforward and purely informational.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:  \n   The code is simple and correct. No logical flaws or errors are evident. The handling of `--version` argument is consistent, and the output functions are standard.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0 or 0.0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**:  \n   No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; the analysis is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n6. **Score Reasonableness**:  \n   The assigned scores (all zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk) are reasonable and justified.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment**:  \n   The code is benign, straightforward, and serves a purely informational purpose. There are no indicators of supply chain or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Malware Score**: 0  \n**Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n**Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Additional note**: Given the code's simplicity and the absence of any suspicious or malicious elements, I agree with the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a benign CLI utility.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior detected.\n- Scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code analysis.",
