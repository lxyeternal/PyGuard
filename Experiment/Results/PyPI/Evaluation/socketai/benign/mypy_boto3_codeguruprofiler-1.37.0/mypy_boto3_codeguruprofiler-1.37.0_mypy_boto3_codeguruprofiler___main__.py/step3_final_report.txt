{
  "purpose": "A minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input; static strings in print_info() and print_version() functions",
  "sinks": "stdout via sys.stdout.write() for output",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check ('--version') leading to print_version() output; otherwise, print_info() output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static output with no dynamic or external data processing",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI script that checks for '--version' argument and outputs either version info or package details. It does not fetch external data, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code is clear, static, and serves an informational purpose. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
