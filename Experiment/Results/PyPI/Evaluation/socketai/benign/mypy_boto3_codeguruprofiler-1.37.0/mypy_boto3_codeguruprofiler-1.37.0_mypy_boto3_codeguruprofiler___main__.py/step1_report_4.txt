{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI entrypoint for a package, providing version and info outputs.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and writes info or version data to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, calls print_version() and exits; otherwise calls print_info() to output package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns observed. Code appears straightforward, with standard output functions.",
  "analysis": "The script checks command-line arguments for '--version' and conditionally outputs package version or info. It only interacts with stdout and sys.argv, with no network activity, file manipulation, or untrusted input handling. No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected, and no malicious behavior evident. It appears to be a benign CLI utility intended for informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying package info and version. No malicious intent or suspicious activity detected. It is safe to use.",
