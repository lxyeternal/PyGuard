  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command line arguments), sys.stdout (outputs information)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs data), usage of sys.argv for input control",
  "flows": "Command line argument '--version' (source) triggers print_version (sink), otherwise print_info (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. Code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple command-line interface that outputs static package info or version when requested. It reads command line arguments from sys.argv and writes output to sys.stdout. There are no external data fetches, network connections, or sensitive operations. The code appears to be purely informational with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple CLI utility for displaying package info and version. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
