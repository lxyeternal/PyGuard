{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and a paginator class for the CodeGuru Profiler service client, facilitating type-safe pagination in Python applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version info from sys.version_info, imports modules and types, and defines a class with a method for pagination.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data, execute external commands, or include network operations; it primarily sets up type annotations and class inheritance.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the only data-related operations are importing modules and defining class methods with type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code consists of standard class definitions, type annotations, and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and types, defines a paginator class inheriting from a base class, and provides a method for pagination with type annotations. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets, malicious imports, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be part of a type stubs or SDK helper module, designed solely for type safety and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of a paginator class with type annotations for a specific AWS service. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected.",
