{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the CodeGuru Profiler AWS service in boto3-stubs, facilitating type-safe API calls.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class and method definitions; string documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "Methods accepting keyword arguments unpacked from various request type definitions; methods returning typed responses or dicts; properties accessing exception classes.",
  "flows": "API method calls receive parameters from callers, unpack into request types, and return structured response types or dictionaries; exception properties access error classes; documentation comments are static.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are evident. All methods appear to be standard API wrappers with clear, documented purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a client class for AWS CodeGuru Profiler with type annotations, properties, and method signatures aligned with boto3 documentation. It imports necessary modules, defines exception types, and provides method signatures for API calls, all adhering to standard patterns. No hidden or malicious code segments are identified; the structure and content are consistent with a type-annotated client interface for an SDK. The comments and code organization are clear and intended for documentation and type safety, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK interface for AWS CodeGuru Profiler with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely an API wrapper with type annotations, serving as a safe and standard component for interacting with AWS services.",
