{
  "purpose": "The code provides a type-annotated SDK client interface for AWS CodeGuru Profiler, facilitating API interactions with well-defined request and response types.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore, type definitions, class and method signatures, and documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters unpacked into request types, returning response types or dictionaries; no untrusted data handling or network operations beyond AWS API calls.",
  "flows": "Input kwargs flow into API request methods, which invoke AWS services and return responses; no suspicious data flow or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; code is a standard SDK wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured SDK client for AWS CodeGuru Profiler, consisting of method signatures, type annotations, and documentation. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The methods are straightforward API wrappers, unpacking request parameters and returning typed responses. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The generate_presigned_url method is a standard AWS feature, not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are consistent with the code's nature and pose minimal security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SDK interface for AWS CodeGuru Profiler with no malicious or security issues. The scores and confidence levels are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
