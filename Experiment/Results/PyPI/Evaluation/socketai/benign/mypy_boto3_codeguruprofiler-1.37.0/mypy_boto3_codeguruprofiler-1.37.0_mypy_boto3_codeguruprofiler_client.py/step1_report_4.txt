{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and class structure for the CodeGuru Profiler AWS SDK client, providing an interface for interacting with the service.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; property and method implementations.",
  "sinks": "None of the methods or properties execute untrusted code, handle external inputs, or perform dangerous operations. No network connections, code execution, or data exfiltration evident.",
  "flows": "Method definitions with parameters unpacked from request types; no dynamic code execution or untrusted data flows are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is standard for a generated SDK interface, primarily consisting of method signatures and property definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured SDK client interface with type annotations. It imports standard libraries and AWS SDK components, and defines methods corresponding to AWS API operations. No suspicious or malicious constructs, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution or obfuscated code. The purpose is to provide a type-safe interface for the CodeGuru Profiler service, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, standard SDK interface code without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any dangerous actions or data leaks and is safe for use from a security standpoint.",
