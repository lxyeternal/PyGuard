  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the AWS CodeGuru Profiler service.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions, import statements, class definitions, method signatures, and property accessors.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters and return types that handle API request parameters, responses, and exception types.",
  "flows": "Method calls passing request data to AWS API endpoints, with responses or exceptions being returned or raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. Code appears to be a standard client interface and type annotations for an AWS SDK.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured Python module providing type annotations and a client wrapper for AWS CodeGuru Profiler. It imports necessary modules, defines a class for exceptions, and a main client class with methods corresponding to API calls. There is no evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity is present. The code strictly adheres to AWS SDK standards, focusing on type annotations and method signatures for API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign SDK interface with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It provides type-safe access to AWS CodeGuru Profiler functionalities, with no malicious behavior detected.",
