  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code provides type annotations and client interface definitions for the CodeGuru Profiler AWS service, sourced from imports, class/method definitions, and comments.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods unpack kwargs into request types and return typed responses, with no suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are detected. The code is a standard SDK wrapper.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that the code is legitimate and safe is well-supported, with high confidence (0.95). Malware score is 0, security risk minimal (0.1).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard structure, no malicious activity, and straightforward API interface.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reinforces the standard SDK pattern, no suspicious behavior, no data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95, malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, confirms standard, well-structured SDK interface with no malicious elements.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous assessments: standard SDK interface, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Presence of malicious code or backdoors:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware scores:** All reports indicate 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious intent.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, consistent with the nature of SDK interface code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a typical, well-structured, type-annotated SDK client for AWS CodeGuru Profiler.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious activity are evident.\n- The high confidence levels and consistent findings support that this is legitimate SDK code.\n\n### Recommended scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, inherent to SDK code, not security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and appropriate for its purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments needed.",
