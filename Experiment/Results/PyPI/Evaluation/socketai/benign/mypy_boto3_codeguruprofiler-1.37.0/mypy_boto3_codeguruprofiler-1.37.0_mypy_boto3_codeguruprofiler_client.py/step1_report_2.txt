{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class for interacting with AWS CodeGuru Profiler service, facilitating structured API calls.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and types, class definitions, method signatures with parameters, docstrings describing each method.",
  "sinks": "Methods calling AWS API endpoints; no explicit sinks for untrusted data; no code execution or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Method calls (sources) lead to AWS API interactions (sinks), but no data flow indicative of malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code strictly defines a client interface with no embedded malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type annotations, imports, and class/method structures for AWS API interactions. It uses standard patterns for boto3 client wrappers and type definitions, with no indication of data manipulation, malicious payloads, or obfuscated code. All functions are simple method signatures with docstrings, and no logic or data processing occurs within this snippet. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured interface for AWS CodeGuru Profiler, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate SDK client wrapper focused on type safety and documentation.",
