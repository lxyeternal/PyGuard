  "purpose": "Provide a main interface for the CodeGuru Profiler service, allowing users to access the client and paginator classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules (.client, .paginator) and inline comments/documentation.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data is processed or transmitted to external sources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code primarily sets up imports and references without data flow operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The comment block includes a potential typo in the documentation URL but that is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from relative modules, assigns a class to a variable, and defines an export list. It contains documentation and licensing info. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be a straightforward API interface setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple interface module for the CodeGuru Profiler SDK, with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It appears safe and standard for SDK setup.",
