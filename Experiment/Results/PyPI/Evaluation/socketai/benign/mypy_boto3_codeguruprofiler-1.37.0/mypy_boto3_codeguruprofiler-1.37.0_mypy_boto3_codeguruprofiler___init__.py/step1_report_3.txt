{
  "purpose": "Provide a main interface module for the CodeGuru Profiler service, importing and exposing relevant classes and clients.",
  "sources": "Code that reads import statements, documentation string, and string literals",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks",
  "flows": "Imports and module-level assignments flow internally; no external untrusted data source or sink interactions",
  "anomalies": "Documentation contains a future copyright year (2025) which is inconsistent with current date; no other anomalies or suspicious code structures",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, module-level variable assignments, and documentation. It exposes classes and clients from local modules. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. The code appears to be a straightforward module interface with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module for exposing the CodeGuru Profiler client and related classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or placeholder.",
