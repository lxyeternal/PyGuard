  "purpose": "Main interface for codeguruprofiler service.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator); static code with no dynamic input.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static code with imports and assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025) noted, likely a placeholder; no malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module defining a client interface with static imports, class aliasing, and documentation. It contains no user input, network activity, or dynamic execution. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code is benign and standard for SDK modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
