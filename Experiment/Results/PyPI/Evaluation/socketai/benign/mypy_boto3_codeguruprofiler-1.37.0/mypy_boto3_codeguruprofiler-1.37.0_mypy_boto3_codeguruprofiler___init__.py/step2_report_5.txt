  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, standard Python SDK interface module.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows are identified.\n- The code is mainly composed of imports, class assignments, and documentation.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are detected.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is benign and likely a placeholder or typo.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of Issues in the Code:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code snippets.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the code.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made without evidence.\n- The future copyright year is noted but is not a security concern.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and align with the code's simplicity.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are unjustified.\n- The minor anomaly (future year) does not warrant a higher risk score.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering the future date as a very minor anomaly, but 0 is more appropriate)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Based on all evidence, I concur with the assessments that the code is safe and free from malicious or obfuscated content.",
