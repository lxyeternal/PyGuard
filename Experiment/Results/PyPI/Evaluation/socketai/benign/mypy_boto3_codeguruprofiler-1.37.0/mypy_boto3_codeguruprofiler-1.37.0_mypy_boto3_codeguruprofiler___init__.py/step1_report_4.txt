  "purpose": "This code provides a main interface for the codeguruprofiler service, offering class and function imports to facilitate interaction with the AWS CodeGuru Profiler.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), and the embedded documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only performs static imports and documentation.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code solely defines imports and documentation without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The copyright date is set in 2025, which is in the future but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes from local modules, assigns a class to a variable, and defines __all__ for exports. It contains a detailed docstring with usage instructions and documentation links. No external data handling, user input, or security-sensitive operations are present. The structure is simple and standard for Python modules. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard interface module for AWS CodeGuru Profiler with no malicious intent or security concerns. It solely facilitates importing classes and functions for client interactions. No malicious or security-related issues are detected.",
