{
  "purpose": "Provides a main interface module for interacting with the AWS CodeGuru Profiler service, including imports and client setup.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), hardcoded strings (documentation URL, copyright, class and function names).",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data sources or sensitive data flows identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly sets up classes and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and typical for an SDK interface module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules, assigns one class to a variable 'Client', and exposes symbols via __all__. It contains documentation comments and copyright info. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module for a Python SDK interface. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious anomalies, or security risks identified. It simply exposes client classes for the CodeGuru Profiler service.",
