{
  "purpose": "Provides main interface and documentation for the codeguruprofiler service, importing and exporting client classes and paginators.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator) and the docstring at the top of the file.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data processing points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly defines aliases and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a large docstring with detailed usage instructions, which is typical and benign. No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as an interface module, importing specific classes and functions and exposing them via __all__. The docstring provides usage instructions and documentation links. No external inputs are processed, no untrusted data flows are present, and no suspicious code behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign interface module with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured and does not contain any anomalies or suspicious code segments.",
