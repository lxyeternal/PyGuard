  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for mypy-boto3-codeguruprofiler.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Static data from local file and hardcoded metadata used directly in setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static configuration with no dynamic or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It reads a local README.md file, imports setup from setuptools, and calls setup() with static, predefined parameters. There are no dynamic data sources, network operations, or code execution beyond static configuration. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious behaviors are present. All signals point to a benign, standard package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward, static configuration file for packaging, with no signs of sabotage or malicious code.",
