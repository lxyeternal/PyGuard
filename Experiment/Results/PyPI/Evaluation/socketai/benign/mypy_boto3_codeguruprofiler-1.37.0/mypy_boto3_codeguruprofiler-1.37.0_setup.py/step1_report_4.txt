  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-codeguruprofiler package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup from setuptools, and static string values within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or transmits data; no untrusted data handling, network communication, or external system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the script performs static configuration and file reading only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. All data appears static and intended for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: reading a static README.md file for description, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, network access, or handling of untrusted input occurs. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign, standard setup configuration file with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
