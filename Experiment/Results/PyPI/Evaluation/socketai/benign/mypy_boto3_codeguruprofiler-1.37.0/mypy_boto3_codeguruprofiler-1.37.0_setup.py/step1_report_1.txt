  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-codeguruprofiler', used for packaging and distributing type annotations for the boto3 CodeGuruProfiler service.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'README.md' for the long description; imports 'setup' from setuptools; defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no network, file, or system modification code present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code structure is standard for a Python setup script, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup for a Python package. It reads a local Markdown file for long description, imports setup, and defines package metadata including dependencies, classifiers, and URLs. There are no dynamic executions, no user input handling, and no external data processing or network communication. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
