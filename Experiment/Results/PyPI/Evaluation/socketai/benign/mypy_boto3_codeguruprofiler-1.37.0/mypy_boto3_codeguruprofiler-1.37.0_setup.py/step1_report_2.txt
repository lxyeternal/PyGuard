  "purpose": "This setup script is for configuring the package 'mypy-boto3-codeguruprofiler', including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; imports 'Path' from pathlib; imports 'setup' from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink points identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads static file for description, then calls setup() with static parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic detected. The code appears to be standard package setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and setuptools, reads a local README file for description, and calls setup() with static, well-formed parameters. All data sources are static or controlled. There are no dynamic inputs or outputs to untrusted environments. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
