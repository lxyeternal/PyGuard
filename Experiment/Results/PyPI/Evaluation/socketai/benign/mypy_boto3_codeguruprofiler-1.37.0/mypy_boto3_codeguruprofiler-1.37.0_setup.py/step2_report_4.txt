  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard Python package setup script.\n- No dynamic or untrusted data sources are involved.\n- No network, file, or system modifications are present.\n- The code reads a local README.md file, imports standard libraries, and calls `setup()` with static parameters.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, with confidence levels of 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description, performs a typical setup, and contains no errors or malicious logic.\n- **Malware presence:** None detected; the code is static and standard.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n- **Security risks:** None identified; the script is purely for package configuration.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- The only unusual aspect is reading a local README.md file, which is standard in setup scripts. This does not pose any security risk.\n- All package metadata appears static and well-formed.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correctly assigned; no malicious activity).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correctly assigned; code is clear and straightforward).\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct; no security risks).\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The report's assessments are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The setup script is a typical, safe package configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security concerns.",
