  "purpose": "Set up the namespace for the indexed_gzip package by importing classes and functions, and define a version string.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal module '.indexed_gzip'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static imports and definitions.",
  "flows": "Import statements from internal module to namespace; alias creation; version string assignment.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is static, straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py file for a Python package, importing specific classes and functions from an internal module, creating an alias for backward compatibility, and defining a version string. It does not process external input, execute dynamic code, or handle sensitive data. All signals indicate benign, static setup code with no malicious or security-related issues. The reports correctly identify this as a simple namespace setup with no security concerns. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are justified and consistent with the code's nature. The confidence level is high (1), given the static and transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The existing reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
