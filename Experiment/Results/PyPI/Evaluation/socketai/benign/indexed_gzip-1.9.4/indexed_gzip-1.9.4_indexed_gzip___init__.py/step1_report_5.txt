  "purpose": "The code defines a namespace for the indexed_gzip module, importing specific classes and functions, and creates an alias for compatibility purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .indexed_gzip import",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no data output or external communication",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink that could cause harm",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no obfuscated or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from a local module, creates an alias, and sets a version string. It functions as a straightforward namespace setup without any suspicious activity. There are no external inputs, no data handling, and no code execution beyond imports. No anomalies or indicators of malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It merely sets up the namespace and version information for the package.",
