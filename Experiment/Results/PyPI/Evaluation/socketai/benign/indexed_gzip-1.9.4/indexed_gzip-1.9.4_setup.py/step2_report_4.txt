  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, code quality, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup for building a Python package with Cython, handling dependencies, and cleaning build artifacts.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the script as a typical build setup. No issues or suspicious behaviors are evident. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing build configuration, optional Cython compilation, and cleanup routines.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings. The code is standard, and no malicious activity is detected. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical build script with environment-based configuration and cleanup.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** No suspicious behavior. The code is routine for such build scripts. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar setup with environment variables influencing build options, cleanup routines, and conditional compilation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — slightly above zero, but still very low.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score might reflect the use of environment variables influencing build behavior, but nothing malicious. The low score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard build and cleanup script with environment variable control.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** No suspicious activity detected. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, mostly 0, with one report at 0.1 due to environment variable influence, which is typical for build scripts.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the code analysis.\n- The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- The environment variables are used for configuration, which is standard practice.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — typical build script with no security issues.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate setup script for building a Python extension module. No security concerns or malicious activity are present.",
