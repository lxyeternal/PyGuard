  "purpose": "Configure pytest options and fixtures for testing data processing, including data generation, seed setting, and file management.",
  "sources": "Command-line options (--nelems, --concat, --use_mmap, --seed, --testfile, --niters); filesystem for test data files; numpy random seed.",
  "sinks": "File creation via gen_test_data; seed setting for numpy's RNG.",
  "flows": "Command-line options influence fixture values; fixtures determine test data file generation and seed initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; standard test setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines pytest options and fixtures for test parameters, manages test data files, and seeds the RNG for reproducibility. It conditionally generates test data files if missing, using an external trusted function. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The code is straightforward, with clear logic and standard practices for testing environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest configuration script for test data setup, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and appropriate.",
