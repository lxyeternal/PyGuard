  "purpose": "Configuration and fixture setup for pytest testing framework, including options for test data generation and randomness control.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments via 'request.config.getoption'; numpy's random number generator.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data flows; no external system calls or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Command-line options influence fixture behaviors such as seed setting, test data generation, and test parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. No obfuscated or misleading code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines pytest options and fixtures for testing purposes, handling randomness and test data files. It includes logic for dynamic seed setting, optional memory mapping, and test data file creation. The usage of numpy for randomness and file generation is standard and safe. No external network connections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing setup for pytest with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It handles test data generation, seed setting, and configuration options securely. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
