{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform integration tests for the nibabel library with indexed_gzip support, creating, loading, and verifying NIfTI images.",
  "sources": "Input data from image files created during testing ('image.nii.gz') and file system operations (shutil.move).",
  "sinks": "File operations like to_filename(), shutil.move(), and pytest.raises() for error handling.",
  "flows": "Data generated by create_random_image() -> saved as files -> loaded via load_image() -> converted to numpy arrays for comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors observed. Usage of standard libraries and testing practices is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a test suite for image handling with nibabel and indexed_gzip, involving image creation, file manipulations, and validation. All operations are related to testing file IO and image data integrity. No network activity, credential handling, or system modifications are present. The code relies on standard and well-known libraries, and the logic appears straightforward and focused on testing. No anomalies or signs of obfuscated or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a secure testing suite for image file handling with nibabel and indexed_gzip. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It performs file creation, manipulation, and validation in a controlled testing environment with standard libraries.",
