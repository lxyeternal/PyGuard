      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured source code transformer for Python f-strings, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk stems from the use of 'eval' for feature detection, which is a common pattern and safe in this context. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting very low risk. The code does not pose any significant security threat and is suitable for use."

      "conclusion": "The code pattern involves executing dynamically constructed code during package setup, which is a known security risk and can be exploited for malicious purposes. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, the pattern is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The high use of 'exec' during installation warrants caution, and the code should be reviewed and refactored to eliminate such practices."
