  "purpose": "This code appears to implement a custom Python codec for handling and transforming f-strings, including parsing, decoding, and possibly rewriting source code with f-string support.",
  "sources": "Reading input from a file specified by command-line argument, reading from sys.stdout.buffer, importing modules (argparse, codecs, sys, io, encodings, tokenize_rt), accessing environment implicitly via module imports",
  "sinks": "Writing transformed source code to stdout; potential injection if input is malicious, but primarily a source-to-source transformation without external communication or data exfiltration",
  "flows": "File input read -> decode function processes bytes into string -> tokenization and transformation of string -> output encoded and written to stdout",
  "anomalies": "Code performs complex string parsing for f-strings, raises SyntaxError for malformed expressions, and transforms source code; no suspicious hardcoded secrets, network activity, or system modifications are present. Uses dynamic evaluation only for checking native f-string support, which is safe in this context.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions for parsing and handling Python f-strings, including syntactic validation and source code transformation. It uses a custom tokenization module 'tokenize_rt' to process source code and convert it to tokens, then modifies string tokens containing f-strings for consistent formatting. The core functionality is source code parsing and rewriting, not external communication. The decode function reinterprets bytes input as Python source, transforming f-strings to a format compatible with older Python versions if needed. There are no indications of malicious code like network access, data exfiltration, or system modification. It only processes files, transforms source code, and outputs the result.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a source code transformer for Python f-strings, enabling compatibility or transformation of source files. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The complexity appears to be solely for source parsing and rewriting, with no suspicious external activity or data leaks. It is a benign utility focused on source code manipulation.",
