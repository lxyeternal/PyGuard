  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured source code transformer for Python f-strings, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk stems from the use of 'eval' for feature detection, which is a common pattern and safe in this context. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting very low risk. The code does not pose any significant security threat and is suitable for use."
