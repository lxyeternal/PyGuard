  "purpose": "A framework for performing and reporting upgrade readiness checks in a CLI environment, with classes for status codes, results, and command execution flow.",
  "sources": "CLI arguments, configuration options, and user-defined check functions",
  "sinks": "Standard output via print (JSON or formatted tables)",
  "flows": "Input from CLI and configs to check functions; results processed and outputted to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured CLI framework for executing upgrade checks and displaying results. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no network activity, file manipulation, or dynamic code execution. The output methods are typical for CLI tools, and no suspicious data handling is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, benign framework for upgrade checks with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score is appropriate given its function, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at zero.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
