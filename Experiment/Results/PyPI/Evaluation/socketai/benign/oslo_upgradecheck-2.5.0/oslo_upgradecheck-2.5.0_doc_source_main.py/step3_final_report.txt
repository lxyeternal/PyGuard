{
  "purpose": "A simple CLI script demonstrating static upgrade checks using the oslo_upgradecheck library, serving as an example or placeholder.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static methods success() and failure() return fixed results.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Static method calls within the Checks class; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, static implementation with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static CLI tool defining two methods that always succeed or fail, registered in a list and executed via the main function. It imports standard libraries and open-source modules without any dynamic input, network activity, or malicious code. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate benign intent. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior, though the risk could be considered even lower. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static example of an upgrade check CLI with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with its behavior.",
