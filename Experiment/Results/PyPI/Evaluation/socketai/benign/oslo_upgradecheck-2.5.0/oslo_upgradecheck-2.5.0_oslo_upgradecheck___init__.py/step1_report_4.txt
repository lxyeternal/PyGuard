  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a utility or module for some application, possibly involving data processing or network communication.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, file inputs, or network responses.",
  "sinks": "Writes data to files, outputs to console, or sends data over network sockets.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or network inputs through processing functions, then to outputs such as files or network destinations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamically executed code, obfuscated variable names, or unnecessary use of eval/exec could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. Hardcoded credentials or API keys, if found, are suspicious. Unusual use of insecure functions or external network connections without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain obvious malicious functions such as sending system data to external servers, accessing suspicious domains, or performing destructive operations. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard. No hardcoded secrets are immediately evident. However, if dynamic code execution or obfuscated code is present, it warrants further scrutiny. The data flow indicates typical input/output operations, with no evident malicious intent. The overall structure suggests a standard utility module, but the presence of any obfuscated segments or dynamic code execution would elevate suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not show clear signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It appears to be a typical utility with no evident malware or security risks. Confidence is moderate due to potential obfuscation or dynamic code execution not being fully visible.",
