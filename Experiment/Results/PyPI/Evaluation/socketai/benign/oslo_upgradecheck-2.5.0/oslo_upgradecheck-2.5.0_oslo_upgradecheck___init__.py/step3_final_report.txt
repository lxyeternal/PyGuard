  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, dynamic code execution points, network/file operations, environment variables, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs to sinks like data transmission or file modification, possibly via dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation (e.g., obfuscated variable names, dynamic code), suspicious import patterns, dynamic execution functions, or hidden network activity.",
  "analysis": "All reports generally conclude the code is benign or unreviewable due to lack of content, with some suspicion of obfuscation. The scores for malware are mostly low (0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal confirmed malicious activity but some concern about obfuscation or dynamic code. Obfuscation suspicion scores (0.2) are consistent where suspected. Security risk scores (0.1-0.3) align with the potential for obfuscation but lack of evidence. The confidence levels are appropriate given the information. Slight adjustments are recommended: lowering malware scores in reports 3 and 4 from 0.1 to 0.05 to better match the absence of confirmed malicious activity, and maintaining low obfuscation and risk scores. Overall, the assessments are internally consistent and cautious, with no unjustified claims.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears non-malicious with minor suspicion of obfuscation. Scores should be slightly adjusted downward for malware to reflect the lack of confirmed malicious activity. The overall security posture is low risk, but vigilance is advised if code details become available.",
