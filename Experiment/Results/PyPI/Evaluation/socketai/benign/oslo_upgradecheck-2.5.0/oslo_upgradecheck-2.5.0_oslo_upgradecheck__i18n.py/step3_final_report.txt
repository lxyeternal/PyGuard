{
  "purpose": "Setup internationalization support for the 'oslo_upgradecheck' domain using oslo_i18n library functions.",
  "sources": "The call to oslo_i18n.get_available_languages(DOMAIN) which retrieves supported language codes.",
  "sinks": "The function get_available_languages() returning data; no external sinks or data leaks involved.",
  "flows": "Source: oslo_i18n.get_available_languages(DOMAIN); Sink: return statement providing language list.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known internationalization library, sets up translation functions, and provides a simple function to retrieve available languages. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The library call is standard and safe. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical setup patterns, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "This dependency is benign, performing standard internationalization setup with no malicious or security risks. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1) are appropriate and justified based on the code's behavior.",
