  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions. No explicit purpose is clearly defined from the code provided.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from user inputs, environment variables, or external files read within the script.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls that could be exploited if untrusted data is processed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., input, environment variables) through processing functions, possibly reaching sinks like network or file system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. No hidden backdoors or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python constructs with no unusual features or patterns. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical. No suspicious code execution, credential handling, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The structure and format are straightforward, indicating no obfuscation. All data handling and external interactions follow common patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script with standard functionality.",
