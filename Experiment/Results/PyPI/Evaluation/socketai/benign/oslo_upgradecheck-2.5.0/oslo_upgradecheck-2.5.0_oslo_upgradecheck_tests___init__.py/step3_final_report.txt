  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, untrusted inputs) to sinks (network, file system), potential for malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Potential dynamic code execution, obfuscation hints, incomplete code snippets, vague descriptions suggesting possible malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate either empty or benign code with no concrete evidence of malicious activity. Malware scores are consistently 0, matching the absence of malicious code. Obfuscation scores are 0, aligning with no obfuscation detected. Risk scores are low (0.2-0.3), reflecting minimal concern but acknowledging uncertainties due to incomplete code or vague descriptions. Report 5 hints at potential dynamic execution and obfuscation, warranting a slight increase in malware (to 0.5), obfuscated (to 0.3), and risk (to 0.4) scores to better represent the suspicion. Overall, the assessments are cautious and consistent with the evidence, with no modifications necessary except for the noted adjustment in Report 5.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets across all reports are either benign or too vague to determine malicious intent. Scores are appropriately low and consistent with the descriptions. The only adjustment recommended is increasing Report 5's malware score to 0.5, obfuscated to 0.3, and risk to 0.4 to reflect potential concerns. No other changes are necessary, and the overall evaluation remains that the code is unlikely malicious based on current evidence.",
