  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe test suite with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary concern is the execution of external scripts, which should be validated in production environments. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the risk score around 0.2 reflects the external script execution risk."
