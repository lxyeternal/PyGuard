{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for community detection and hierarchical clustering on graphs, converting various input formats into edge lists and invoking native Rust implementations for Leiden algorithms.",
  "sources": "Graph objects (networkx, adjacency matrices, edge lists), input parameters (e.g., starting communities, thresholds).",
  "sinks": "Native library calls; no external system, network, or file operations observed.",
  "flows": "Input data -> validation and conversion functions -> graspologic_native clustering functions -> output community mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation, data format conversion, and calls into a native Rust library for community detection. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The native calls are assumed to be secure and are standard for high-performance graph algorithms. The scores across reports are consistent and justified, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) due to reliance on external native code, which is common practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-validated interface for community detection algorithms. No malicious or obfuscated components are present. The low security risk score is appropriate, assuming the native library is maintained securely.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
