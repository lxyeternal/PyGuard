  "purpose": "A version placeholder for the package, intended to be replaced during build time.",
  "sources": "The __version__ variable assignment and the __version() function returning this variable.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The function __version() returns the static __version__ string; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward placeholder with no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static version string and a function to return it, with comments indicating build-time replacement. It contains no input handling, external communication, or dynamic code execution. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The code is standard for version management in Python packages, and the comments clarify its placeholder purpose. No security issues, malware, or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version placeholder file with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
