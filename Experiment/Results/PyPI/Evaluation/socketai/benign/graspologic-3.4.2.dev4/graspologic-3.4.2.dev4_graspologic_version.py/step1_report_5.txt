  "purpose": "Defines a version string for the package and provides a function to retrieve it.",
  "sources": "The __version__ variable assignment at the beginning of the file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The function __version() -> str retrieves the __version__ variable.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a version string __version__ with a placeholder value that will be replaced during package build, indicating it's a build-time configuration. The function __version() simply returns this variable. There are no external input sources, no data processing, and no suspicious behaviors. The code serves a typical purpose in package versioning. It does not perform any network activity, data manipulation, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version placeholder used during package development. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The structure is simple, clear, and consistent with common versioning practices.",
