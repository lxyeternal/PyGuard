  "purpose": "Defines a version string for a Python package and provides a function to retrieve it.",
  "sources": "The version string __version__ and the function __version()",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The function __version() retrieves the value of __version__, but there is no external input or data flow beyond this assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates the file is a placeholder for versioning during build, which is standard practice; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to a variable and provides a getter function. No input, no output manipulation, no data flow that could be exploited. No suspicious behavior or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign version placeholder with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
