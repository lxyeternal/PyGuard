  "purpose": "Define and provide access to the package version string.",
  "sources": "The __version__ variable assigned the string '3.4.2.dev4'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or effects; the code only returns a static string.",
  "flows": "The function __version() returns the __version__ variable directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version string definition with a simple getter function. The comment indicates this is a placeholder for build-time replacement, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string __version__ with a placeholder value intended to be replaced during build. It provides a function __version() that returns this string. No external input, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a standard versioning pattern with a build-time placeholder. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign version placeholder with no malicious behavior. It serves a common purpose of version tracking with a placeholder for automated build updates.",
