{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and export functions and classes related to graph analysis, specifically for histogram calculations and graph cut operations, likely for a larger graph processing library.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions and classes from a local module named 'graph_cuts'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data is leaked, as the code only imports and defines exports.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code simply sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present; the code consists of standard import and export statements with clear licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several functions and classes from a local module, likely related to graph algorithms. It then defines '__all__' for explicit module exports. There are no signs of data processing, input handling, or potential malicious activity. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are observed. The structure and comments suggest this is a legitimate part of a graph processing library, with proper licensing attribution. No anomalous or malicious elements are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for exporting graph-related functions and classes. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no obfuscated code. The security risk is minimal, and confidence in this assessment is high.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
