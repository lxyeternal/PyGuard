  "purpose": "To provide an interface for importing specific functions and classes related to graph cuts and centrality histograms from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.graph_cuts). No external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data leaks or vulnerabilities identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code is primarily import/export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward module import/export.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of importing functions and classes from a local module named 'graph_cuts' and defining the module's __all__ list for exports. There are no dynamic executions, input/output handling, or suspicious patterns. It appears to be a standard module interface file. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module that acts as an interface for specific graph-related functions and classes. No malicious activity, security issues, or obfuscation are present.",
