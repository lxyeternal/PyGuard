{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports specific functions and classes from a local '.graph_cuts' module and exports them via __all__, acting as an interface for graph analysis functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads data only from the local module '.graph_cuts' during import statements.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only establishes imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with licensing comments, import statements, and an export list.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports specific functions/classes from a local module and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no data processing, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The structure and comments suggest a legitimate open-source library component. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, aligning with the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the code's transparency and simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
