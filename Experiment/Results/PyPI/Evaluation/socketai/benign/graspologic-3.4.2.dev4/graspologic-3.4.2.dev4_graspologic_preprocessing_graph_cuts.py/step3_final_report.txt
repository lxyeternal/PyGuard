{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for analyzing and manipulating graphs, including generating histograms of edge weights, degree centrality, and betweenness centrality, as well as pruning nodes and edges based on thresholds. It is intended for in-memory analysis within larger graph processing workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads edge attributes such as 'weight' and node centrality measures from the graph data structures; no external data sources or inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network activity, or data exfiltration occurs; all operations are confined to in-memory graph modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from graph edge attributes and node properties into histogram calculations and centrality measures, then into filtering functions that prune nodes or edges based on thresholds.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. Logging is used solely for benign warnings about missing data attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries (networkx, numpy, logging) to perform common graph analysis tasks. Input validation is appropriate, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation techniques are used. The functions operate on copies of graphs, ensuring no unintended side effects. There are no signs of malicious payloads, network activity, or data leaks. The logic is straightforward, well-documented, and aligns with typical data analysis workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for graph analysis and pruning, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 or 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
