{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for analyzing graph structures, including generating histograms of edge weights, degrees, and betweenness centrality, and pruning graphs based on these metrics.",
  "sources": "Data sources include graph edges (with optional weight attributes), node degrees, and betweenness centrality calculations derived from networkx functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include graph modifications such as edge removal and node removal, but these are standard graph operations. No data is sent over networks or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from graph attributes (edge weights, node degrees, centrality measures) into histogram calculations or into filtering functions that decide which edges/nodes to remove based on thresholds. These metrics are derived internally from networkx algorithms; no external data is injected or exploited.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are present. Usage of logging is standard for warnings; no suspicious logging or side effects are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard graph analysis libraries (networkx, numpy) for statistical analysis and graph modification. It includes input validation, logging warnings for missing edge weights, and allows configurable histogram binning. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The functions perform typical graph processing tasks with appropriate safeguards. There is no evidence of code injection, hidden network activity, or data leaks. The code structure and usage are typical for analytical modules.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard graph analysis module that performs statistical and filtering operations using well-known libraries. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected based on this review. It appears to be legitimate, clean, and safe for use.",
