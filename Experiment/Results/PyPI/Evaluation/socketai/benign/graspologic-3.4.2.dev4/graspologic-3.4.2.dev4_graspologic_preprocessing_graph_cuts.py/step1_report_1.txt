{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for analyzing and manipulating network graphs, including histograms of edge weights, degree centrality, and betweenness centrality, as well as methods for pruning graphs based on these metrics.",
  "sources": "Data is read from graph edges (weights) and node properties such as degree centrality and betweenness centrality via networkx functions. Inputs are the graph object and parameters like thresholds, which are internal and controlled.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include networkx's centrality functions (betweenness_centrality), histogram computations, and graph modification methods (remove_edge, remove_node). No external untrusted data is directly written or transmitted. No evidence of data leaks or external communications is present.",
  "flows": "Input graph data flows into centrality calculations and histogram functions; thresholds and filter functions are applied internally; edges/nodes are pruned based on filter outcomes; no external data output or system interaction beyond graph modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code relies on standard libraries and networkx functions, with no obfuscation or unusual language features. Logging is used for warnings about missing edge weights, which is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code performs graph analysis through well-documented and standard networkx functions. It includes functions to generate histograms of edge weights and centrality measures, and to prune graphs based on threshold criteria. The use of filtering functions for thresholding is straightforward. All operations are within the scope of standard graph processing. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or network communications. The code does not perform any suspicious actions such as system manipulation, data exfiltration, or stealth operations. No obfuscation techniques are used. The presence of logging is normal for debugging or informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of graph analysis and pruning functions using networkx and numpy. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It is a typical analytical utility module with no indications of security risks or malicious intent.",
