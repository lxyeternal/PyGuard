{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for analyzing and manipulating network graphs, including histograms of edge weights, degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and graph pruning based on thresholds.",
  "sources": "Graph edge data (weights), graph nodes for centrality calculations, user-provided parameters (thresholds, cut processes, bin directives, random seeds).",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies or removes edges/nodes in graphs; no direct data exfiltration or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (graph edges, node attributes, user parameters) flows into functions that compute histograms, centralities, or prune graphs; results are returned as modified graph objects or histogram data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code present. Usage of logging warns about missing edge weights, but this is benign. No suspicious code patterns or indirect execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard graph analysis and manipulation functions, using well-known libraries like NetworkX and NumPy. The functions filter edges and nodes based on thresholds, generate histograms, and do not include network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors. Logging is used solely for warnings related to missing edge weights. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage are detected. The code appears clean, transparent, and appropriate for graph analysis tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical graph analysis operations without any malicious behavior or security risks. There are no indicators of supply chain sabotage or malware. It is safe for use within the intended scope of graph processing.",
