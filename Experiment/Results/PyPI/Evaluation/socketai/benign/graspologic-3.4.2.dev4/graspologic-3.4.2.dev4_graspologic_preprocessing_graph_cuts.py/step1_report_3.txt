{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for analyzing and manipulating graphs, specifically generating histograms of edge weights, degrees, and betweenness centrality, and pruning graphs based on these metrics.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from networkx graphs, particularly edge attributes (like 'weight') and node degrees and betweenness centrality calculations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that lead to data leaks or system effects are present; the code only performs in-memory graph analysis and modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from graph edge/node attributes into histograms and filter functions; filtered vertices or edges are removed from graph copies, with no external data exfiltration or system commands invoked.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward graph analysis functions with no unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or hidden backdoors. All operations are standard uses of networkx and numpy libraries. No hardcoded credentials, external network connections, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports common libraries for logging, randomness, and numerical computations, and uses networkx for graph analysis. Functions generate histograms based on edge weights, degree centrality, and betweenness centrality, and allow pruning graphs by thresholds. The code includes proper data handling, logging for missing attributes, and standard parameter validation. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, system commands, or backdoors. The logic is clear and consistent with typical graph analysis workflows. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious external interactions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed for graph analysis tasks using networkx and numpy. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured analysis utility for graph metrics and pruning.",
