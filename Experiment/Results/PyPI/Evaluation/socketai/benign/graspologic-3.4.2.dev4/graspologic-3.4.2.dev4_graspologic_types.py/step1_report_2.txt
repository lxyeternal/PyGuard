{
  "purpose": "Define type hint declarations and imports for a graph-related Python module, with compatibility considerations for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, typing, networkx, numpy, scipy.sparse; variable assignments and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code does not process untrusted input or perform sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains detailed commentary explaining compatibility workarounds for Python versions. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or hidden behavior identified. The code adheres to standard practices for type hinting compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and third-party modules for graph processing. It conditionally redefines generic types based on Python version to ensure compatibility, which is a common and safe practice. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. The comments and structure suggest it's a utility module for type hinting, not an attack vector or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module focused on type hint compatibility across Python versions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The code appears well-structured and safe.",
