{
  "purpose": "Define type hint declarations for common graph and matrix representations used in graspologic modules, ensuring compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, networkx, numpy, scipy.sparse; type annotations and version checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or data output points; type alias definitions do not process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines type aliases and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of version-specific type aliasing to maintain compatibility across Python versions is unusual but necessary; no malicious code or obfuscation detected; no hidden behaviors or code injections.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type hints with conditional imports based on Python version, ensuring compatibility with different Python syntax and typing features. It imports modules necessary for graph and matrix operations, but does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or include any code that could be malicious. The comments explain the rationale for version-specific type aliasing. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident; the code is standard for type hint declarations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module establishing type aliases for compatibility purposes. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is purely for type hinting and compatibility management.",
