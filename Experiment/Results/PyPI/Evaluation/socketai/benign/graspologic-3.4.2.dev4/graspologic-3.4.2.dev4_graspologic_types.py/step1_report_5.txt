  "purpose": "Define type hint aliases for common data structures used in graspologic, including matrices and graphs.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, networkx, numpy, scipy, and builtins.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no data processing or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this module only declares type aliases and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type alias declarations based on Python version to support type hinting syntax compatibility. It imports standard libraries and third-party packages without performing any data processing, network communication, or sensitive operations. The conditional import structure adapts to different Python versions, which is common practice for compatibility. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage are present. The module's purpose is purely for type annotations and compatibility support.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious module used for defining type hints and ensuring compatibility across Python versions. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
