  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same code: a module that defines type aliases for graph data structures, with conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility.\n- No report indicates any dynamic behavior, data processing, or network activity.\n- The code is well-commented, explaining the rationale for version-dependent type aliasing.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and potential issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code is consistent, and the type aliasing logic is standard for maintaining compatibility across Python versions.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; the code is purely about type hints and compatibility.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Security risks:** None evident; no external input, data processing, or sensitive operations.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring review:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0.5 or less, which seems reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Note:** The reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The detailed comments about version-specific behavior and the use of `sys.version_info` are accurate and standard practice.\n- The conditional imports ensure compatibility but do not introduce any security concerns.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made in the reports, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Given the evidence, I concur with the reports' conclusions:**\n\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**However, for completeness, I would suggest:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Remain at 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 is acceptable, representing minimal risk due to compatibility complexity but not maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, as it's a compatibility utility with no security concerns)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0       | No malicious code or behavior present                       |\n| Obfuscated       | 0       | Clear, well-commented code, no obfuscation                   |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2     | Minimal risk due to version compatibility complexity       |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Final note:** The code is safe, standard, and serves a utility purpose without security implications.",
