{
  "purpose": "Defines type hint aliases for graph-related data structures with conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, networkx, numpy, scipy.sparse; version_info for Python version detection.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely static type alias definitions.",
  "flows": "Conditional import based on sys.version_info determines which type aliases are used; no data flow beyond import logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward compatibility code with detailed comments explaining rationale.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility utility for type hints, using sys.version_info to select appropriate type aliases for different Python versions. It imports standard libraries and third-party packages, then defines type aliases for adjacency matrices, graph representations, and random number generators. The code contains no dynamic execution, data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. Comments clarify the purpose and implementation details. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-documented compatibility utility for type hinting in graph processing projects. It contains no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
