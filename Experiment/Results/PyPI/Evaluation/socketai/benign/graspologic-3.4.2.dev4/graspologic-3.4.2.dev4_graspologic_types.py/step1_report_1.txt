{
  "purpose": "Define type hints and compatibility for graph-related data structures in Python, primarily for use in type annotations within a larger package.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, networkx, numpy, scipy, and builtins; no external input sources or user data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, network communication, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; code mainly sets type aliases for internal use.",
  "anomalies": "Use of version-dependent type aliasing is complex but standard practice; no suspicious or malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type aliasing for compatibility across Python versions, using conditional imports. It defines type hints for matrices, graphs, and random number generators. The comments explain historical reasons for implementation choices. No suspicious functions, external data handling, or malicious constructs are present. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module establishing type hints and version compatibility. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a standard, well-documented compatibility layer for type annotations.",
