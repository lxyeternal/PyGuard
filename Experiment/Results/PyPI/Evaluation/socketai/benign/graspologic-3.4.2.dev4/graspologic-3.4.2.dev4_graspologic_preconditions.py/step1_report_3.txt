  "purpose": "Utility functions for type checking, argument validation, and graph property validation, intended to ensure data integrity and correctness within a larger codebase.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'value', 'required_types', 'message', 'check', 'graph', 'weight_attribute'; and data from 'graph.edges(data=True)'.",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions (TypeError, ValueError); iterating over graph edges for validation.",
  "flows": "Input data is checked and validated; exceptions are raised upon invalid input; edge data is inspected for 'weight' attribute and numeric values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are present. Functions perform standard validation tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of validation functions that check types and argument conditions, and a graph utility to verify that all edges contain numeric weights. The functions raise exceptions if conditions are not met, serving as safeguards within a larger application. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors. No suspicious or hidden operations are present. The code's structure and functionality are straightforward, focusing solely on validation tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign, providing utility functions for type and data validation. There is no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. The functions serve as safeguards to ensure data integrity in a larger application context.",
