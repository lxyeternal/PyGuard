  "purpose": "Utility functions for type checking, argument validation, and graph edge weight validation in a Python package related to network analysis.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as 'value', 'check', 'graph', and 'edge data'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the functions could influence program flow or data handling if misused, but there are no direct sinks that lead to data leakage or system impact.",
  "flows": "Input values are checked for type or condition validity, with no untrusted data being propagated to external systems or outputs. The flow is internal validation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The code strictly performs input validation and simple attribute checks.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type validation and checks for numeric edge weights in networkx graphs. It includes functions for argument type enforcement and validation of graph edge attributes. No external data is fetched or written, nor are there any network connections or system modifications. The functions are straightforward utility checks with no hidden or malicious logic. No signs of backdoors, malicious code, or data leaks are present. The license comment indicates open-source intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility functions for data validation within a network analysis context. There is no malicious behavior or security risk observed. The functions do not perform any harmful operations, and the overall design is consistent with safe, defensive programming practices.",
