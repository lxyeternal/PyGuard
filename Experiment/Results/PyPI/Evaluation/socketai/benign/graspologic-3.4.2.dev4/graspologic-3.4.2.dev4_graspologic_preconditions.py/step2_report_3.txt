  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the potential security implications, correctness, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code consists of utility functions for type validation and graph edge attribute checking.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are identified across reports.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external data access, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are all zero, consistent with the benign assessment.\n- The confidence levels are high, indicating strong agreement among reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code functions as intended for validation; no issues or bugs are reported or evident.\n- The functions perform simple type checks and attribute inspections.\n- No code anomalies, such as obfuscation or suspicious logic, are present.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- None are identified in the reports or evident from the code.\n- The functions correctly raise exceptions on invalid input.\n- No logical flaws or security vulnerabilities are apparent.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, aligning with the lack of security issues.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies or Recommendations:\n- The reports' scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely utility functions for type validation and graph attribute checks. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The functions serve as safe, defensive programming practices.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe supply chain security incident report accurately reflects the benign nature of this code. No modifications to the scores or conclusions are warranted. The code is safe, well-understood, and does not pose any security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\nand affirm that the code is secure and non-malicious.",
