  "purpose": "Utility functions for type checking, argument validation, and graph edge weight validation in a graph analysis context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'value', 'required_types', 'message', 'check', 'graph', and 'weight_attribute'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not write or transmit data untrusted or outside its scope.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated locally; the 'is_real_weighted' function reads edge data from a networkx graph to verify edge attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation; straightforward validation logic; no external network calls or file I/O.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type and argument validation functions and a graph edge attribute checker, all of which are standard utility functions. The 'check_argument_types' and 'check_optional_argument_types' functions verify data types; 'check_argument' asserts boolean conditions; 'is_real_weighted' checks if all edges have numeric weights. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling present. No external data exfiltration, network activity, or file operations are performed. The functions rely on standard Python and NetworkX libraries, with no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of utility functions intended for input validation and graph data verification. There is no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It does not perform any harmful operations, data exfiltration, or system modification. The overall security risk is minimal.",
