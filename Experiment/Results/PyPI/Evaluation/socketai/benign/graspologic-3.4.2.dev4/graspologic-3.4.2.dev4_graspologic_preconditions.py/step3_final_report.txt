  "purpose": "Utility functions for type validation and checking if all graph edges have numeric weights.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as 'value', 'graph', 'weight_attribute', and data dictionaries within graph edges.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to potential data leaks or malicious actions; functions only perform validation and checks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are checked and validated; no external data or untrusted data flows to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; straightforward validation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard validation functions: type checks and ensuring graph edges have numeric weights. It does not perform any network, file, or system operations. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The functions raise exceptions on invalid input, which is typical for validation routines. The 'is_real_weighted' function verifies that each edge has a 'weight' attribute of a real number, with no side effects or external calls. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign utility functions for input validation and graph attribute checking. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing security scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
