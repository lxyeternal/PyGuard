{
  "purpose": "Import statements for various graspologic submodules and version assignment, likely for setup or initialization.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from graspologic package modules and version variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static imports do not process external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely import statements with no dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from the graspologic library and a version assignment. There is no dynamic code, network activity, or data handling. The code is clear, well-structured, and serves as a setup script. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static import setup from a well-known open-source graph analysis library. There are no malicious activities, obfuscation, or security concerns. The scores are justified and should be set to zero across all categories.",
