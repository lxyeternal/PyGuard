{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules and components from the graspologic library, which is used for graph analysis and statistical inference.",
  "sources": "Imports from graspologic modules and types, and version information from graspologic.version.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted inputs or potential vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements with no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or suspicious constructs. The assignment of __version__ is standard and unremarkable.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely importing modules and a version string from the graspologic package. It appears to set up the environment for further analysis or processing without executing any logic. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The structure and content are straightforward and consistent with a standard library import setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign import setup for the graspologic library. There are no indicators of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. It is a standard pattern of importing modules for graph analysis tasks.",
