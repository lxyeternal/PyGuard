  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code only imports modules and sets a version variable.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5. The risk score is at the threshold; given no malicious activity, a lower risk score (e.g., 0.1) might be more appropriate.  \n- **Justification for higher score?** None needed; the code is benign.  \n- **Malware score justification:** Zero, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Assumptions?** The report correctly dismisses any suspicion based on static imports.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Same as above, only imports and version info.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. Slightly above zero, but given the benign nature, perhaps too high. A score of 0.0 would be more accurate.  \n- **Malware justification:** Zero, no malicious activity.  \n- **Assumptions?** Correctly dismisses any suspicion.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issues present?** No.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The risk score could be lowered from 0.1 to 0.0, as no security concerns are identified.  \n- **Malware justification:** Zero.  \n- **Assumptions?** Correct.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issues present?** No.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Malware justification:** Zero.  \n- **Assumptions?** Correct.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issues present?** No.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Malware justification:** Zero.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static, benign, and consists solely of import statements.  \n- The malware score should be 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.  \n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0, given the straightforward import statements.  \n- The security risk scores are slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), but given the benign nature, they should be 0.0 for consistency and accuracy.  \n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a standard, benign import setup with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward import script from the graspologic library, with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The scores should reflect this, with all scores at zero.",
