{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a utility module providing various functions for graph processing, such as importing graphs, manipulating adjacency matrices, and checking graph properties.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports functions from local modules (.ptr and .utils).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the module only defines imports and an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is static, consisting solely of import statements and an __all__ list.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static utility module with no executable logic, data processing, or external data handling. It imports functions from local modules and defines an export list. No dynamic code, network operations, or data leaks are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external inputs indicate a benign purpose. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
