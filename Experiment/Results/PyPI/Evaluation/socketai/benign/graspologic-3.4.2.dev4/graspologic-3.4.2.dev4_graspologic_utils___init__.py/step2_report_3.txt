  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely a set of import statements and an `__all__` list, with no executable logic, data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard utility module.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 seem appropriate.\n- **Note:** No issues here; the report's conclusion aligns with the code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the code only contains imports and an export list, with no external input or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Also benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are reasonable.\n- **Note:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—imports and `__all__`. No data processing or suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Clearly benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 fit well.\n- **Note:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Identical to previous reports—just imports and exports, no execution or external data handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 appropriate.\n- **Note:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above—utility functions with no dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 fit.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code Presence:** The code snippets are static import/export definitions with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** Zero is justified, as there's no indication of security issues.\n- **Malware Score:** Zero, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero, code is straightforward.\n- **Confidence:** High, given the static and benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Scores:** All reports are consistent with a malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 assessment.\n- **Additional Notes:** No further action needed; the code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility module for graph processing, authored by Microsoft, with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
