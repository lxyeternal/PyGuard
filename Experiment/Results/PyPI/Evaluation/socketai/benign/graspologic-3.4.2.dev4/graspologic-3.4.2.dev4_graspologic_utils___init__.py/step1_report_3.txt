{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and imports for graph processing and analysis, such as importing graphs, checking graph properties, and manipulating adjacency matrices.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data read operations are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing points are present; the code only defines imports and an export list.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists within this code, as it solely consists of imports and function exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard for a utility library.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports functions from local modules and defines an __all__ list for export. All functions appear to be standard utility functions related to graph processing, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscated code. The comments and licensing information suggest legitimate authorship from Microsoft. There are no signs of hidden or suspicious logic, no dynamic code execution, and no external data handling that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for graph operations, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions as part of a larger project, likely for graph analysis, and does not process untrusted input directly.",
