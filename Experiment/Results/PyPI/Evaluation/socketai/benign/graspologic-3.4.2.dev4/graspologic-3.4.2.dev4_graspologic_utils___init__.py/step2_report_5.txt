  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is benign, consisting of utility functions and imports with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code contains only import statements and an `__all__` list, with no executable code or data handling.\n- **Potential issues:** None identified; the reasoning is sound.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the benign nature of the code, with no external data handling or malicious intent.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score remains 0, consistent with the absence of suspicious behavior.\n- **Potential issues:** None; reasoning appears valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms the code is standard utility functions with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0, matching the static, import-only nature.\n- **Potential issues:** None; reasoning is consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that the code is a benign utility module with no external data processing or malicious code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0, consistent with the code snippet.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: a standard utility module with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, aligns with the code's static, import-only structure.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is purely import statements and an `__all__` list, with no executable logic, data processing, or external input/output.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected; all reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** None evident; no data leaks, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** All reports correctly assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores as 0.\n- **Additional notes:** Given the static and benign nature of the code, no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured utility module with no security concerns.",
