{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and module exports for graph processing, normalization, and analysis, primarily used in network or graph-based algorithms.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from local modules (.ptr and .utils). No external input sources are directly used in this fragment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted data handling are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines imports and exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or unusual code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, which is standard for Python modules to specify public API. It imports functions from local modules without any dynamic execution, network calls, or external data processing. No potential attack vectors or malicious behaviors are detected in this static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign utility module exporting various graph processing functions. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious code, or security risks present in this fragment.",
