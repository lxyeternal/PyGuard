  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Code match:** The code is purely import statements and an `__all__` list; no executable logic, data processing, or external inputs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it finds no suspicious activity.\n- **Code match:** Same as above; no dynamic code, no external data, no malicious payloads.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, finds no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Code match:** Same as previous; no executable logic, no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** The analysis is correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—benign, no malicious behavior.\n- **Code match:** Static import statements and an export list.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Code match:** Purely import/export definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The analysis aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Behavior:** None of the reports or the code indicate any malicious activity, such as backdoors, payloads, or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code (utility functions, no data processing, no external inputs), the overall security risk is minimal, and a score of 0.0 is justified.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, as there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and align with the static code analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility module with no security concerns.",
