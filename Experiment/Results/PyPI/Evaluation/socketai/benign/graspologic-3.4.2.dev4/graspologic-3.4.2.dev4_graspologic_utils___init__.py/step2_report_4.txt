  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The code is described as a benign utility module with imports and exports related to graph processing. No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** Given the static nature of the code, the lack of dynamic execution, and the standard licensing, these scores seem appropriate.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the benign nature, standard imports, no external data handling, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** The code's structure and purpose do not suggest any malicious intent or security risk.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is a straightforward utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** Consistent with previous assessments, the static and standard nature of the code justifies these scores.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: benign, standard import/export pattern, no malicious indicators.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior reports; no malicious or suspicious features.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code snippet provided is purely a module with imports and an export list. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or dynamic code that could be malicious or obfuscated.  \n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** All reports correctly identify the benign and standard nature of the code. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.  \n- **Score Reasonableness:** All malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are zero across reports, which is appropriate given the static, utility nature of the code.  \n- **Potential for Malicious Behavior:** Given the code snippet, there's no evidence of malicious intent. The scores reflect this accurately.  \n- **Assumptions and Claims:** The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly noting the absence of suspicious patterns or behaviors.  \n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (consistent across all reports and justified)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)  \n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Since the code is purely import/export definitions with no executable logic, the scores should remain at zero unless future code or context suggests otherwise.  \n- The confidence level in all reports is high (1), and that aligns with the static, benign nature of the code snippet.  \n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0  \n\nThis assessment aligns with the provided code and reports.",
