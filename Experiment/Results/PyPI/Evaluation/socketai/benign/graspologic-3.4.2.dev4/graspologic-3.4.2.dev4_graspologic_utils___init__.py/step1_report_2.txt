{
  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions for graph processing and analysis, including importing graphs, modifying adjacency matrices, and checking graph properties.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading occurs directly within this code snippet; all functions are imported from other modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, no network or file operations, no data leakage or malicious effect visible.",
  "flows": "N/A, the code mainly defines imports and exports without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated segments. All functions are typical for graph analysis modules.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements from local modules and an __all__ list defining the exported API. There are no embedded executable statements, data processing, or input/output operations that could pose security risks. The functions and constants are related to graph processing, with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The presence of licensing comments and standard import/export patterns suggest this is a legitimate, well-structured open-source utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign utility library for graph analysis, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It solely defines functions and constants for external use.",
