{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an import and export module for a package related to clustering algorithms, specifically Leiden and modularity functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.leiden and .modularity). No external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that handle untrusted data; no external network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module that imports specific classes and functions from local submodules and defines __all__ for exports. No external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious variables or logic. It appears to be a typical package initialization file, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initialization script with no malicious intent or security concerns. It primarily organizes and exposes functions and classes for use in other parts of the package.",
