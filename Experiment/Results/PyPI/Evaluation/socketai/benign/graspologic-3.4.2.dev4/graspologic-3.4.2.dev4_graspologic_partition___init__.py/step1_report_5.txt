  "purpose": "This code serves as an __init__.py file to organize and expose specific classes and functions from submodules for external use, facilitating module import.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules .leiden and .modularity",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or external data",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. The code simply re-exports components.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions from internal submodules and defines __all__ for export. It contains no dynamic execution, network calls, or data handling. The structure is typical for Python package initialization, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package __init__.py file that organizes imports for ease of use. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation in this code.",
