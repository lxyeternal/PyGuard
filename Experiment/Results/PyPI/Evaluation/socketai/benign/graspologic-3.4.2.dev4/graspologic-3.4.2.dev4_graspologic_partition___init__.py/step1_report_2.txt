{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to define an API interface for clustering algorithms, exporting functions and classes related to hierarchical clustering and modularity analysis.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions and classes from local modules (.leiden and .modularity). It does not read external input or untrusted data directly.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data are present. The code only exports functions and classes without executing or passing data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks within this code snippet; it primarily sets up exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no signs of unusual or obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from internal modules, then defines __all__ to specify the public API. It is standard for Python packages and contains no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. There are no external data inputs, data processing, or network interactions present in this snippet. The purpose appears to be module export configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python module setup for exposing clustering functionalities. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious code, nor does it involve handling untrusted data. It appears safe and standard for open-source packages.",
