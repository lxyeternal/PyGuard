  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer (__init__.py) that imports specific classes and functions from internal modules and exposes them via __all__ for public API.",
  "sources": "Imports from .leiden and .modularity modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network calls, or file operations; no data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "Import statements to __all__ declaration; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export structure",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package __init__.py file, importing classes/functions from internal modules and defining __all__ for API exposure. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The structure is typical for package initialization, with no suspicious constructs or anomalies. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple expert assessments, all assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
