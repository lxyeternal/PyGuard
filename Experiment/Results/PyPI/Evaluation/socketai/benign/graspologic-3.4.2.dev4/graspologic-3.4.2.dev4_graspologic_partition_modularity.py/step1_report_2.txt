{
  "purpose": "The code calculates modularity scores for community detection in undirected, weighted graphs using NetworkX.",
  "sources": "Reads data from networkx graph objects, specifically edges and their weights; reads community assignments from a dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Returns floating-point modularity scores; no evident data sinks that could leak data externally.",
  "flows": "Reads graph edges and community data; computes modularity components; outputs numerical scores. No untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard modularity calculation for community detection, with validation functions ensuring proper input types and graph properties. No external data transmission, credential handling, or suspicious behavior observed. All operations are confined to in-memory graph analysis and numerical computations. The licensing comment and import statements are benign. The functions follow expected patterns for network analysis, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of modularity calculations for network analysis. It contains no malicious behavior or sabotage elements. It is safe to use from a security perspective.",
