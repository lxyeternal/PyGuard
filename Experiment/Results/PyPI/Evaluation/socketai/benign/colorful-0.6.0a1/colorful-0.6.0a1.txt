      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the overall security risk is negligible (~0.1), primarily due to the environment version check which is benign."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for color validation and conversion, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only minor technical improvement is fixing the regex to include start and end anchors for stricter validation, but this does not impact security. The reports accurately assess the code as safe, and the scoring is justified."
