{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to provide functions for styling terminal output using ANSI escape codes, including color conversions and text formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines constants, imports, and functions with parameters provided at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The functions generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling but do not write to files, send data over networks, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "There are no untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; input parameters (colors, values) are internally provided or externally supplied during function calls but do not lead to data leaks or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are present. The code performs straightforward calculations and string formatting for terminal styling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants, color conversion functions, and a custom rounding function. The functions rgb_to_ansi256 and rgb_to_ansi16 perform RGB to terminal color conversions with simple mathematical operations. The code does not include external input/output operations, system commands, or network activities. The logic appears standard for terminal styling libraries, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. All functions operate on input parameters and produce ANSI escape sequences accordingly. There are no indications of data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward terminal styling utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It is safe and serves to generate ANSI escape codes for formatting terminal output. There are no security concerns or malware indicators.",
