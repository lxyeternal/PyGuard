  "purpose": "Provides functions to convert RGB color values into ANSI escape codes for terminal styling, supporting 256-color and 16-color modes.",
  "sources": "RGB values provided as function parameters; internal constants for ANSI codes and modifiers.",
  "sinks": "Generated ANSI escape sequences used for terminal output styling; no external data or untrusted input flows.",
  "flows": "RGB inputs -> color conversion functions -> ANSI escape code strings -> terminal display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward implementation with no obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for ANSI styling, implements color conversion functions (`rgb_to_ansi256`, `rgb_to_ansi16`) with a custom `round()` method, and generates escape sequences for terminal styling. The functions perform standard mathematical conversions without external data dependencies or network activity. The custom `round()` function mimics standard rounding but is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is purely cosmetic, and all operations are safe and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for terminal styling, performing RGB to ANSI color conversions. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are detected. The scores are correctly set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
