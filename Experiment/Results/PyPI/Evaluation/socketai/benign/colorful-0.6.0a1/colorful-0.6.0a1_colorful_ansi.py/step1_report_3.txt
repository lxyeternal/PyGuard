  "purpose": "This code provides functions and constants for styling terminal output with colors and text modifiers, including conversions from RGB to ANSI color codes.",
  "sources": "Constants and functions that process input values such as RGB components for color conversions, and predefined ANSI escape sequences.",
  "sinks": "The functions output ANSI escape codes for terminal styling; no data sinks are present that could leak untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input RGB values are processed through color conversion functions to generate ANSI color codes, which are then used in terminal styling sequences.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden behaviors, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is straightforward, primarily for styling terminal output. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for ANSI escape sequences and includes functions for RGB to ANSI color conversions (both 256-color and 16-color). The 'round' function is used internally for calculations. There are no input/output operations, network activities, or suspicious code patterns. The purpose appears to be purely cosmetic terminal styling without any security concerns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of terminal styling utilities. It performs color conversions and defines ANSI sequences for styling output, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
