{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for terminal string styling using ANSI escape codes, including color conversions from RGB to ANSI formats.",
  "sources": "Input RGB values passed to rgb_to_ansi256 and rgb_to_ansi16 functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output effects identified.",
  "flows": "RGB values from function calls flow into color conversion functions, which generate escape codes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. Code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for terminal styling and color conversions. It includes functions to convert RGB values to ANSI 256-color and 16-color formats, with proper rounding and threshold handling. No external inputs are read directly, nor are there any output or network operations. The functions are purely computational for terminal styling, with no suspicious or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign library for terminal styling with no malicious intent, no suspicious data handling, or malicious payloads. It is a straightforward utility module for color conversion.",
