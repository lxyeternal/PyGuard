{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for terminal string styling, specifically for converting RGB color values to ANSI escape codes for terminal display.",
  "sources": "The code reads RGB color values (r, g, b) as function parameters in rgb_to_ansi256 and rgb_to_ansi16 functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions output ANSI escape codes or color codes which are used for terminal styling; no data is written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input RGB values -> Conversion to ANSI code -> Return of color code or escape sequence",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code consists solely of color conversion functions and string formatting for terminal styling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for ANSI styling, including color and modifier codes, and provides functions for converting RGB colors to terminal-compatible ANSI color codes (both 256-color and 16-color). The 'round' function is a custom implementation that rounds values based on decimal parts. No external data sources, network activity, or untrusted input handling beyond RGB parameters are present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors. It strictly performs color conversion for styling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for terminal styling with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It simply converts RGB values into ANSI escape sequences for display purposes, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
