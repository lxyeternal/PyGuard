{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for terminal string styling, including color conversions from RGB to ANSI escape codes.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; functions operate on parameters provided during calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs involving untrusted data or external systems; functions generate ANSI codes based on input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input RGB values -> Conversion functions -> ANSI code strings",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. The code strictly handles color conversions and escape sequences.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for ANSI escape sequences and contains functions for converting RGB color values to ANSI 256-color and 16-color codes. These functions use mathematical operations and conditional checks to map RGB values to terminal color codes. There is no evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward and purely functional, focused on styling terminal output with no external network communication or sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility module for terminal text styling with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs standard color conversions and escape sequence formatting, with no anomalies or suspicious behaviors.",
