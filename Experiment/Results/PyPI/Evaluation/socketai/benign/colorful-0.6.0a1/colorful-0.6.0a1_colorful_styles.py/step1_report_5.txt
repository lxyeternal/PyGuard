{
  "purpose": "Define color schemes for terminal styling in Python.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines dictionaries with color hex codes.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations or data outputs involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or processing occurs beyond dictionary definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it declares two dictionaries, SOLARIZED and MONOKAI, containing color names mapped to hexadecimal color codes. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external calls, and no dynamic code execution. The purpose is purely to store static styling information for terminal color schemes. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It appears to be a benign, well-structured module intended for styling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is safe, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It serves as a static resource defining color schemes for terminal styling.",
