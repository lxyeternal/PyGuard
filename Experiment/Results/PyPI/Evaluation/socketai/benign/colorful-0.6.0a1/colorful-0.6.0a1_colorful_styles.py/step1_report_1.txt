  "purpose": "Defines color schemes for terminal string styling, specifically 'solarized' and 'monokai' themes.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources; the code only declares static dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no processing or output functions present that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code solely contains static data definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be straightforward theme definitions with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two dictionaries storing color codes for terminal styling themes. There are no functions, input handling, or dynamic execution. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors. The content is consistent with a theming library or utility module for terminal styling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely defining static color schemes for terminal styling with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
