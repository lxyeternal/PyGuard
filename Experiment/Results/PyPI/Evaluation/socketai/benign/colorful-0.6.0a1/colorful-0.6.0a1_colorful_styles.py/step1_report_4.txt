  "purpose": "Define color schemes for terminal styling using dictionaries for Solarized and Monokai themes.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; only static dictionary definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code solely declares static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static variable declarations containing color codes in dictionaries. No external data input, no code execution, no network activity, and no sensitive data handling. It appears to be a straightforward configuration or resource file intended for styling purposes. The code does not include any dynamic code execution, external calls, or hidden behavior. The presence of licensing comments and well-structured static data further suggests benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration module defining color themes for terminal styling. There is no malicious behavior, no security risks, and it does not pose any threat.",
