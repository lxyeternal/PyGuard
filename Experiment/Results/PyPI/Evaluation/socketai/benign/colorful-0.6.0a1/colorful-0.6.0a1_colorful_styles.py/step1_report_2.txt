  "purpose": "Define color schemes for terminal styling in Python",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static definitions only",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output functions present",
  "flows": "No data flows; all variables are static dictionaries",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; only static color definitions",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static dictionary definitions for color schemes named SOLARIZED and MONOKAI, used for terminal styling. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and solely involves defining constants for color values. No signs of malicious behavior, hidden code, or security risks are evident. It is purely definitional.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a static configuration for color schemes. There are no indicators of malware or security threats.",
