  "purpose": "Static definitions of terminal color schemes for styling purposes.",
  "sources": "None; static dictionary assignments with color hex codes.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; static data without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward static configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static dictionary definitions for two color themes, SOLARIZED and MONOKAI. There are no functions, input/output operations, dynamic code, or external data sources. The code is well-structured, with comments and licensing info, indicating a benign purpose. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious constructs are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. The confidence level is high (1), as the code is clearly static configuration data with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static configuration module defining terminal color schemes. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified, and the code poses no security threat.",
