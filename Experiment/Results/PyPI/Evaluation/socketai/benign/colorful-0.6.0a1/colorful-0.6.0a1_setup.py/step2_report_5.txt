  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup.py for packaging, with no malicious behavior, no untrusted data processing, and straightforward logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The low securityRisk score (0.1) seems reasonable given the nature of setup scripts, which typically have minimal security concerns. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly zero.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard package setup, version extraction via AST, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Completely aligned with the code's behavior. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup, no untrusted input, no malicious code, just file reading and metadata setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correctly reflects the benign nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others—standard package setup, version extraction, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard setup script, safe practices, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code presence:** The code is a typical `setup.py` script with no malicious or suspicious logic.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly zero; no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, consistent with a standard package setup script. The minor securityRisk score of 0.1 in the first report is reasonable, given that setup scripts can sometimes be misused if they process untrusted data, but here they do not.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code reads static files, extracts version info safely via AST parsing, and calls `setuptools.setup()` with well-defined parameters.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malware.\n- The explicit Python version restrictions are standard and benign.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (as per first report, justified by the minimal inherent risk in package setup scripts, but no actual malicious activity)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, safe setup script with no security risks or malicious intent.",
