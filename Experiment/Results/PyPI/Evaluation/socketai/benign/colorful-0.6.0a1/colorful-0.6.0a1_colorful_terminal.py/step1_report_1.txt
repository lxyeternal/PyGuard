  "purpose": "Detects terminal color support based on environment variables and system properties.",
  "sources": "Environment variables such as 'COLORFUL_DISABLE', 'COLORFUL_FORCE_*', 'COLORTERM', 'TERM_PROGRAM', 'TERM'; sys.stdout.isatty() for terminal type detection.",
  "sinks": "None; code only reads environment variables and system properties, with no untrusted data being written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables (sources), makes decisions based on their values, and returns color mode constants (sink). No untrusted data flows outside input checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Logic is straightforward for environment detection.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard environment detection utility for terminal color support. It reads environment variables and system properties to determine supported color modes. No data is written or transmitted; the code does not execute external commands or handle untrusted input beyond environment checks. The logic is clear and typical for such utilities, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment detection script for terminal color capabilities. It performs environment checks without any malicious intent or security risks. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
