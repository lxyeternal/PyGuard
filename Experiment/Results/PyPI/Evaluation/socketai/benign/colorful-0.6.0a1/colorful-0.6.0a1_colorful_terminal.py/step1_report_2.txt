{
  "purpose": "Detects supported color modes for terminal styling based on environment variables and system properties.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., 'COLORFUL_DISABLE', 'COLORTERM', 'TERM', 'TERM_PROGRAM') and system I/O (sys.stdout.isatty()).",
  "sinks": "Potentially influences terminal output styling but does not directly write or execute untrusted data; no data leaks or external communications observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence the function's return value determining color support; system check (isatty) also affects the flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code flow is straightforward with no suspicious obfuscation or unusual behavior. The only potential concern is that environment variables influence output behavior, but this is standard for terminal detection.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables to determine color support in terminal outputs. It only uses safe, non-malicious checks and system properties. No data is sent over the network, no code injection, and no file manipulations are present. The logic is simple and intended for terminal styling detection, with no suspicious or malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign terminal capability detection function with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It relies solely on environment and system checks to determine display capabilities.",
