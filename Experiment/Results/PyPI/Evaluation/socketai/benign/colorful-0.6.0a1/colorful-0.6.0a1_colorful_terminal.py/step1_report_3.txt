{
  "purpose": "Detects terminal color support capabilities based on environment variables and system properties.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables such as 'COLORFUL_DISABLE', 'COLORFUL_FORCE_*', 'COLORTERM', 'TERM', and system properties like sys.stdout.isatty().",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables and system calls to determine output formatting; no untrusted data used in a way that affects system integrity.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and system properties are read as sources, and based on their values, a color mode is returned as the sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; the code straightforwardly reads environment info and makes decisions accordingly.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment-based detection of terminal color support, which is standard behavior. It only reads environment variables and system properties without executing or injecting code. No hardcoded secrets or potentially malicious patterns are present. No obfuscation, no code injection, and no suspicious behavior detected. The logic is clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for environment detection related to terminal color support. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply queries environment variables and system states to determine display capabilities.",
