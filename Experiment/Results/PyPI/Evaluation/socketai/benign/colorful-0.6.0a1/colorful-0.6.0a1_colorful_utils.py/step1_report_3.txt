  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for color conversion and validation, specifically converting hex color codes to RGB and validating hex strings.",
  "sources": "User-provided hex color strings passed to hex_to_rgb() and check_hex() functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data in a way that could lead to data leaks, code execution, or malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "Input hex strings -> check_hex() validates format -> hex_to_rgb() converts validated hex to RGB tuples.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs color validation and conversion. It uses standard Python string and regex operations. There are no external data sinks or network communications. The only potential concern is the regex in check_hex(), but it is correctly formatted for validation purposes. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for color handling without any malicious intent or security risks. It performs straightforward validation and conversion of hex color strings.",
