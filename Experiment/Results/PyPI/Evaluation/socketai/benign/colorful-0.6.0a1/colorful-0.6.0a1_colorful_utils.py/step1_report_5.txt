{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for converting hexadecimal color codes to RGB values and validating hex color strings, intended for styling terminal output.",
  "sources": "The code reads the sys.stdout.encoding attribute for default encoding; user input is not directly read in this fragment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs to untrusted sources are present; functions return processed data locally, with no external data transmission.",
  "flows": "The hex_to_rgb function receives a hex string, sanitizes it, checks validity via check_hex, and converts it to RGB. check_hex validates the format with regex.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The regex is correctly formatted; no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for color validation and conversion. It handles input sanitization and validation securely. No user input, network activity, or file operations are present. The validation regex is correctly constructed, and no dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs safe, intended color processing functions without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility module for color handling with no vulnerabilities.",
