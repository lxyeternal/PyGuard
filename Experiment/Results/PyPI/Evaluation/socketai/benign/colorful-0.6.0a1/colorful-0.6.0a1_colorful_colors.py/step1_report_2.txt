  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse and process color files in .txt and .json formats, and sanitize color palettes for safe use.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from file paths provided to functions parse_colors, parse_rgb_txt_file, and parse_json_color_file. It also reads JSON content from specified files.",
  "sinks": "The code processes data in memory, mainly converting file contents into dictionaries. No direct data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input file paths are read by open(), file contents are parsed and transformed into Python dictionaries, with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No use of untrusted data beyond file reading. The utils.hex_to_rgb function is called, but without revealing its implementation, assuming standard conversion. No malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file parsing and data transformation for color information. It uses standard libraries and clear logic. The file reading and parsing processes are typical and do not involve user input handling or network activity. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The only external function called is utils.hex_to_rgb, which is presumed to convert hex strings to RGB tuples, a standard utility. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for parsing color files and sanitizing color palettes. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use.",
