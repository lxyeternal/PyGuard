  "purpose": "Parse color files (.txt and .json) and sanitize color palettes by converting hex colors to RGB.",
  "sources": "File reading operations in parse_rgb_txt_file and parse_json_color_file functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flow leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "File input -> parsing functions -> data transformation (hex to RGB) -> output dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward parsing and data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code reads color data from files, processes them into dictionaries, and converts hex colors to RGB using an external utility. No obfuscation, malicious code, or network activity is present. External utility utils.hex_to_rgb is assumed safe. The code is clear, with proper handling of file formats and data sanitization. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for parsing and sanitizing color data. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. External dependency appears safe. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.05 are appropriate, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to file handling but no actual vulnerabilities.",
