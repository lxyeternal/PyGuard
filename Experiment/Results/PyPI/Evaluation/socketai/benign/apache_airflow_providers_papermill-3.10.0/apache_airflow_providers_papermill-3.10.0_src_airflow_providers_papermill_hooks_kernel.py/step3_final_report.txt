  "purpose": "Manage remote Jupyter kernel connections and execute notebooks within an Airflow environment, retrieving connection details from external sources.",
  "sources": "Connection metadata (host, ports, session key) obtained from external connection objects and extras.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; connection info is used internally for kernel management.",
  "flows": "Connection info flows from external connection object to KernelConnection, then to RemoteKernelManager and PapermillNotebookClient for execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Default empty session key is noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code manages remote Jupyter kernels via standard classes and functions, with connection parameters dynamically retrieved from external sources. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The session key defaults to an empty string if not provided, which could be a security concern if external security measures are lax, but this is not inherently malicious. The code does not perform any data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious activity. The overall structure aligns with legitimate remote kernel management practices. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting typical external configuration dependencies without inherent vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score is justified given its configuration-driven nature and external dependency management. No modifications are necessary.",
