{
  "purpose": "This code provides metadata and configuration details for the Apache Airflow provider package 'apache-airflow-providers-papermill', including version info, dependencies, and integration documentation.",
  "sources": "The code primarily sources data from hardcoded strings and lists within the Python function get_provider_info()",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the returned dictionary where data could be processed or transmitted; no external or untrusted data sources are used",
  "flows": "Data flows from the hardcoded data structures within get_provider_info() to the return statement, with no external input or untrusted data involved",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is straightforward, auto-generated, and contains no malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a static data definition function that returns package metadata, dependencies, and documentation URLs. It is typical for auto-generated configuration files and contains no dynamic execution, user input, or external data handling. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent are detected. The absence of network calls, credential handling, or system manipulation confirms a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, benign metadata provider for a Python package with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and purely informational.",
