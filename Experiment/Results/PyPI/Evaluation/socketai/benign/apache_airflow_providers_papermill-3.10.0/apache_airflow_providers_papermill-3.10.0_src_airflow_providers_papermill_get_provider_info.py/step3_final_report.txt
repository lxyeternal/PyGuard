  "purpose": "Static package metadata provider function returning information about the apache-airflow-providers-papermill package, including versions, dependencies, and integration details.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings within the get_provider_info() function, static dictionary data.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, user input, or network interactions; data is static and self-contained.",
  "flows": "Function call returns static dictionary; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated Python function that returns a fixed dictionary with package info. It contains no dynamic logic, external data, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is appropriately 0, as there are no malicious actions. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code's clarity. The security risk score is 0, since the code is purely informational and contains no vulnerabilities. The high confidence score (1) is justified due to the static and benign nature of the code. No further analysis or modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static, auto-generated package metadata provider with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The scores assigned in all reports are accurate and justified. No changes are needed.",
