  "purpose": "This code provides metadata information about the 'apache-airflow-providers-papermill' package, including versions, dependencies, and integration details.",
  "sources": "The source of data is static information hardcoded within the function get_provider_info().",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow or source-to-sink data transfer; the function simply returns static package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and purely informational.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function returning a dictionary with package metadata, including name, description, versions, dependencies, and integration info. All data is statically embedded in the code, with no input handling, network communication, or executable code segments. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The purpose appears to be for documentation or package info generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static metadata provider for a Python package and shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
