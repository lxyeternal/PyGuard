  "purpose": "This code provides metadata and configuration information about the 'apache-airflow-providers-papermill' package, including version details, dependencies, and integration info.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded strings, lists, and dictionaries within the get_provider_info() function.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include any external URL references and dependencies, but these are standard and informational, not risky.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded lists and strings within the return statement of get_provider_info() to external documentation URLs and dependency specifications.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior. The code is straightforward and static, primarily providing package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Python function returning package metadata, including dependencies, version info, and integration details. It does not perform any data processing, user input handling, or network communication beyond referencing external URLs. The structure and content are typical for generated package info files. No suspicious code or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose appears to be to serve as a package descriptor without any embedded logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, static package metadata provider with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a generated file for package description purposes.",
