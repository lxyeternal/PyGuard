  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard, auto-generated version check script for an Apache Airflow provider.\n- The code performs a simple comparison of the imported `airflow.__version__` against a minimum required version (2.9.0).\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated behavior is identified across all reports.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted input.\n- The license headers and comments are standard and do not contribute to any security concern.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is benign, primarily for validation.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The version comparison is straightforward and appropriate for dependency validation.\n- The reports' assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or points of concern:**\n- The only potential concern might be if the version check could be bypassed or if the code could be manipulated to execute malicious code. However, given the static nature of the code and the absence of dynamic or untrusted input, this is highly unlikely.\n- Since the code is auto-generated and solely performs version validation, there is no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate. The code performs a benign version check with no security implications.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, safe, auto-generated dependency validation script.\n- No modifications are necessary based on the provided reports.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The reports are accurate in their assessments.",
