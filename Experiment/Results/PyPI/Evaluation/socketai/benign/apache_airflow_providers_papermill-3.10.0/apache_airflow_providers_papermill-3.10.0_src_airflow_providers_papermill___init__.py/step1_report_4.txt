{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an auto-generated module that sets version information and enforces a minimum dependency version requirement for Apache Airflow.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version via an import statement: 'from airflow import __version__ as airflow_version'.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which is a standard control flow for dependency validation.",
  "flows": "The source (airflow_version) flows into a version comparison, which triggers an exception if the version check fails.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines version variables, and performs a version check on the imported Airflow version. It raises an error if the version is less than 2.9.0, which is a typical dependency validation step. The license and license-related comments are standard and do not influence behavior. No suspicious or malicious code segments, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated dependency validation script that enforces minimum version requirements for a dependency. It contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
