{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a package initialization script for an Apache Airflow provider, primarily for version checking and license information.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version from the airflow module (`airflow.__version__`) and the package version (__version__).",
  "sinks": "The code raises an exception if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which could terminate execution or prevent package use.",
  "flows": "Source: airflow.__version__ and __version__; Sink: raising RuntimeError based on version comparison.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual behavior; it performs standard version checking and license comment headers.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with license headers and comments, then imports necessary modules. It assigns a version string to __version__ and imports the Airflow version. It performs a version comparison using packaging.version.parse to ensure Airflow is >= 2.9.0. If the version check fails, it raises a RuntimeError with an informative message. No data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code functions solely for validation and informational purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version check and license information script with no indications of malicious intent. It performs version validation for the package dependencies and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior.",
