{
  "purpose": "This code defines version constraints and imports for an Apache Airflow provider package, with some validation logic on the Airflow version.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`from airflow import __version__`, `import packaging.version`), environment (airflow version variable).",
  "sinks": "None identified that directly lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The airflow version is imported and parsed to compare against a minimum version; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and follows standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports required modules, sets a version string, and performs a version check on the imported airflow version. If the version is below 2.9.0, it raises a RuntimeError with a message. The code appears to be a standard, automatically generated configuration or validation script, with no signs of malicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors. It does not execute untrusted input or perform any network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration script for version validation with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions solely to enforce version constraints and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
