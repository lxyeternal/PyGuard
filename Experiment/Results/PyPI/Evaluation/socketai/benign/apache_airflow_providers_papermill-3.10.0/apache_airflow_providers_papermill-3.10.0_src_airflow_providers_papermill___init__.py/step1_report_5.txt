{
  "purpose": "This code is a generated initialization file for an Apache Airflow provider package, primarily setting version checks and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version via an imported variable and the hardcoded string for __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking the Airflow version and raising an exception if the version is below 2.9.0, based on the imported airflow_version variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward, with version comparison and a conditional raise.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the airflow version, parses it with the packaging library, and performs a version comparison. If the installed airflow version is below 2.9.0, it raises a RuntimeError. All operations involve static data and standard library functions; no dynamic code execution or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard generated initialization script for version enforcement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs version validation in a typical manner without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
