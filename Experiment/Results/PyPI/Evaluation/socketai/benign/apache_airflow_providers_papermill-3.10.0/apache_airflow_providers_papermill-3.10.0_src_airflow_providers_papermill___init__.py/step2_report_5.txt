  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a generated, license header-rich script that imports `packaging.version` and `airflow.__version__`.\n- It assigns a package version `__version__ = \"3.10.0\"`.\n- It performs a version check: if `airflow.__version__` (parsed with `packaging.version`) is less than 2.9.0, it raises a `RuntimeError`.\n- The purpose is to enforce a minimum dependency version requirement for an Apache Airflow provider package.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present.\n- The code is straightforward, auto-generated, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- **Presence of malicious activity:** None. The code performs standard version validation.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Malware:** Zero. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** None. The code is a typical dependency check.\n\n### Logical flaws or errors:\n- The version check logic is correct and standard.\n- The code raises an exception if the environment does not meet the minimum version, which is expected behavior.\n- No issues with the code logic or reasoning.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate; no security risk detected.\n\n### Justification:\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, auto-generated, and performs benign version validation.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the code does not handle untrusted input or perform any risky operations.\n- The version check is a common pattern in dependency management.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Overall malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent, and I concur with their evaluations. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.\n\n**Note:** Always monitor for future updates or related code that might introduce risks, but based solely on this snippet, the code is benign.",
