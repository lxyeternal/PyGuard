{
  "purpose": "This module defines classes and methods for representing and manipulating graph structures, vertices, edges, and related algorithms such as shortest path, strongly connected components, and graph partitioning.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include vertex data, edge data, and external input through method parameters such as add_edge, add_vertex, and path functions. Vertex and edge objects are instantiated and linked within the class constructors and methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include methods that perform path computations, data retrievals, or modifications to the graph (e.g., path(), dijkstra(), get_scs_with_feedback()). These could be exploited if untrusted input influences the graph structure or traversal conditions, potentially leading to resource exhaustion or injection vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Sources such as add_edge() or add_vertex() data flow into graph structure modifications; path() and dijkstra() methods process these structures to compute paths; get_scs_with_feedback() analyzes graph cycles; all these flows involve data moving from inputs to computational algorithms that could be manipulated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are present. The code employs standard Python features and data structures. There are no suspicious dynamic code executions, obfuscation, or unconventional language features. The code appears well-structured for graph data processing. No unsafe handling of environment variables or insecure SQL code is detected. The presence of comprehensive graph algorithms suggests legitimate use.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard classes for graph components, including vertices and edges, with typical methods for graph traversal, pathfinding, and cycle detection. It uses external libraries like 'array' and 'heapq' for performance but no reflective or dynamic code execution mechanisms. No signs of malicious logic such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors are visible. The code's flow is straightforward, implementing classical graph algorithms without any suspicious modifications or hidden behaviors. No obfuscation or unexplained code is present. The code appears designed for educational or analytical purposes in graph processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates legitimate implementation of graph data structures and algorithms. No evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware is detected. The code is well-structured and functions as expected for graph analysis tasks. The overall security risk score is low, with no exploitable vulnerabilities or malicious signals.",
