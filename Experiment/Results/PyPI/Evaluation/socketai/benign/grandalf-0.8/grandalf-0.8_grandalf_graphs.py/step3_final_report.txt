  "purpose": "Implementation of core graph classes including vertices, edges, and graph operations such as pathfinding, cycle detection, and component analysis.",
  "sources": "Data read from vertex and edge attributes, traversal functions, hooks (callables) in algorithms like path and dijkstra.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of arbitrary code via hooks during traversal or analysis functions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through traversal functions (path, dijkstra) where hooks may execute, and through graph modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hooks (callables) in traversal functions which can execute arbitrary code if untrusted functions are passed; recursion limit adjustments in SCC detection are standard and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured graph library implementing vertices, edges, and graph algorithms. No external network or file I/O is present. Hooks are used for extensibility but could be exploited if supplied by untrusted sources. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected. The use of recursion limit adjustments is a common practice for deep recursion in SCC detection. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe, with potential misuse of hooks being the only minor concern, which is a known pattern in such algorithms.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, well-implemented graph data structure with no malicious intent. The hooks, while potentially exploitable if misused, are a common pattern and do not constitute malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal and the malware score is zero.",
