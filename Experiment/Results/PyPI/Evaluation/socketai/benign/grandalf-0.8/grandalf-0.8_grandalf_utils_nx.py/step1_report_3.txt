  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between grandalf and networkx graph representations.",
  "sources": "Imports networkx and grandalf modules; reads data from G.V(), G.E(), G.nodes(), and G.edges().",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data output or external communication functions found.",
  "flows": "Reads graph data from external graph objects; converts and returns new graph objects without external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward and intended for data structure conversions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for converting graph representations between grandalf and networkx libraries. It imports necessary modules locally within functions, avoiding top-level imports. The functions create new graph objects based on provided data, mapping nodes and edges appropriately. No hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The code strictly handles data structure conversions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for graph conversion with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions purely as a data transformation tool for graph objects.",
