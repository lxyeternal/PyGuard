{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for converting graphs between Grandalf and NetworkX formats.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules (networkx, grandalf) and function parameters (graphs, nodes, edges).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is sent over the network or written to files; no use of untrusted external inputs in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; data transformations occur within function calls with local variables, no external flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The functions are straightforward conversions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two conversion functions: one converts a Grandalf graph to a NetworkX graph by adding nodes and edges; the other converts a NetworkX graph to a Grandalf graph by creating vertices and edges with corresponding data. The code imports libraries only within functions, avoiding global import risks. No external data sources, network operations, or file I/O are present. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a utility for graph format conversion without any malicious behavior or security risks. It performs straightforward data transformations using well-known libraries and standard coding practices.",
