  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between grandalf and networkx graph representations.",
  "sources": "Imports networkx and grandalf modules; reads graph data via G.V(), G.E(), G.nodes(), G.edges() methods.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data is written to external systems or transmitted over networks.",
  "flows": "Input graph data (vertices and edges) flow through conversion functions into new graph objects; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward conversion functions between two graph data structures. It imports external libraries and processes data structures in-memory, with no evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscated elements. No suspicious network activity, file operations, or credential handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign utility code for graph structure conversion. There is no malicious behavior, malware, or security risk detected.",
