  "purpose": "Utility functions to convert between grandalf graph and networkx graph representations.",
  "sources": "Imports from networkx and grandalf libraries; usage of function parameters G for input graphs.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input; no data output or network transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Input graphs are processed internally; no external data flows or untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. No dynamic code execution or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward conversion functions between graph representations, utilizing standard library imports and object constructions. It does not include network connections, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. All operations are limited to data structure manipulation, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for graph conversion, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It only performs data transformation without external communications or sensitive data handling.",
