  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between grandalf graph representations and networkx graph representations.",
  "sources": "import statements for networkx and grandalf modules, function parameters (G), internal variable assignments, and data access methods (e.g., G.V(), G.E(), G.nodes(), G.edges()).",
  "sinks": "Method calls such as add_node, add_edge, and creation of graph objects; these are typical data processing operations, not sinks for untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input graphs (G) are read via method calls; data is transformed into internal representations and added to new graph objects; no untrusted data flow to external systems or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code uses standard library imports and straightforward data transformations. No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious function calls.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two conversion functions: one from grandalf to networkx and another from networkx to grandalf. Both functions perform standard graph data structure transformations without external data sources, network communication, or sensitive data handling. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are evident. The code appears to be clean, well-structured, and intended for utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions for graph data structure conversions. There are no signs of malicious intent, security vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. It appears safe for inclusion in larger projects, with no security risks detected.",
