  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting graph representations between grandalf and networkx.",
  "sources": "In-memory graph data structures within the functions, local imports within functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; data is processed internally without external communication.",
  "flows": "Source nodes and edges are transformed into target graph structures within the functions.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in function name 'convert_nextworkx_graph_to_grandalf' (should be 'networkx'), but no security impact.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward data structure conversions with no external network or file I/O, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation. It operates solely on in-memory data, with local imports minimizing risk. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The functions are simple, purpose-specific, and use standard libraries. The typo in the function name is a minor naming inconsistency but does not affect security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for graph conversion with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly zero. The security risk score should be zero, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
