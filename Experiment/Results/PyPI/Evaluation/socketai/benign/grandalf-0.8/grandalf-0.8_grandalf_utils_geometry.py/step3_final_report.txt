  "purpose": "A collection of geometric utility functions for line and circle intersections, spline curve generation, angle calculations, and vector operations, intended for graphical or layout computations.",
  "sources": "Internal function parameters and variables; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data leaks or network communications.",
  "flows": "Data flows within functions through geometric calculations; no external flows or data leaks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of SystemRandom is benign and for geometric randomness only.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard mathematical functions for geometric computations, with optional numpy support. It uses cryptographically secure randomness for vector calculations, but not for security purposes. No external input handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The functions are deterministic and serve visualization or layout tasks. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is well-structured, clear, and adheres to typical mathematical implementation standards.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign geometric utility library with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk due to the use of randomness in geometric calculations. No further action is necessary.",
