{
  "purpose": "The code appears to provide geometric and mathematical functions for graphical or spatial computations, such as line intersection, circle intersection, curve setting, and vector calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters to functions like intersect2lines, intersectR, intersectC, setcurve, tangents, and new_point_at_distance. It also imports modules like math, random, numpy, and a local linear algebra module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive operations are not explicitly directed towards data leaks or system modifications; no explicit data sinks are present. No network or file operations are observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (coordinates, view objects) flow through geometric functions that compute intersections, angles, and curves. These calculations are self-contained and do not lead to external systems or sensitive data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is heavily mathematical with standard functions; no obfuscation or unusual constructs are evident. Usage of SystemRandom for randomness appears benign and intended for stochastic vector generation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides geometric utility functions such as line intersection, circle intersection, vector calculations, and curve generation. It imports standard math libraries and numpy if available, falling back to local linear algebra implementations. No network, file, or system modification code is present. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are identified. The randomness functions are used for generating orthogonal vectors, which seems typical for graphical or spatial algorithms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of mathematical and geometric utility functions with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It appears to be a legitimate library for graphical or spatial calculations. No malicious or maliciously intended code is present. The overall security risk is minimal.",
