  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign geometric utility library with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk due to the use of randomness in geometric calculations. No further action is necessary."
