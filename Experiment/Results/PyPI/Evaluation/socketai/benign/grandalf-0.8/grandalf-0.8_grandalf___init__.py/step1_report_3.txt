  "flows": "N/A (no data flow or untrusted data handling)",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with only an assignment of a list to __all__; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a list of strings to __all__, which specifies the public interface of the module. There are no functions, input handling, data processing, or external interactions present. This is a standard pattern in Python packages to control symbol exports and poses no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of module exports with no signs of malicious behavior or security concerns.",
