  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward assignment of a list of strings to the `__all__` variable.\n- The purpose across all reports is to define the public API of a Python module/package.\n- No data inputs, external calls, or complex logic are present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard Python idiom for managing module exports.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code in question is:\n  ```python\n  __all__ = [\"graphs\", \"layouts\", \"routing\", \"utils\"]\n  ```\n- This is a common pattern in `__init__.py` files or module files to specify which submodules or functions are publicly accessible.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Scores:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These scores are consistent with the analysis and the code content.\n- Given the benign nature, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the code's straightforward nature.\n- Since the code is purely declarative with no external effects, the risk scores should remain low.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n- The code is benign and standard.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the code is safe. The scores reflect the benign nature of this code snippet.",
