  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**:\n   - All reports describe a simple assignment of a list of strings to the `__all__` variable.\n   - The code snippet `__all__ = [\"graphs\", \"layouts\", \"routing\", \"utils\"]` is a standard Python idiom used to define the public API of a module, typically in an `__init__.py` file or similar.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious Behavior or Anomalies**:\n   - No reports identify any malicious code, external calls, data handling, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature of this code.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence level is 1, reflecting high certainty based on the straightforward code.\n\n4. **Assessment of Report Validity and Scores**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as a standard module export declaration.\n   - No adjustments are necessary for the scores; they seem appropriate given the evidence.\n\n5. **Critical Evaluation**:\n   - Since the code is a minimal, standard pattern with no suspicious activity, the risk scores are justified.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly identifies the benign intent.\n\n**Final Justification**:\n- The code is a benign module API declaration.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My Overall Estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's nature.",
