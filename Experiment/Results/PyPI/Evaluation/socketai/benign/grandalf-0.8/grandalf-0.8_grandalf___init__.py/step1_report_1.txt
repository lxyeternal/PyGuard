  "purpose": "Defines the public API of a module by specifying exported submodules or functions.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only module exports are defined.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; only module exports declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscation. The code is a straightforward list of strings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a list of strings indicating submodules or components to the __all__ variable, which controls what is exported when the module is imported. No suspicious functions, data handling, or external interactions are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The structure and content are standard for a Python package's __init__.py or module export list.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module API declaration with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
