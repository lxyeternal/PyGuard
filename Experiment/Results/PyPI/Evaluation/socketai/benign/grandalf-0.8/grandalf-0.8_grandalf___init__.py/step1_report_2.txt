  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or external effects",
  "flows": "No data flow; only a module-level variable declaration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple list assignment without any suspicious or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code declares a list named __all__ containing four module names, which is a common practice in Python packages to define exported symbols. There are no data inputs, no execution logic, no external calls, or any suspicious code structures present. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module export declaration without any malicious intent or security risks.",
