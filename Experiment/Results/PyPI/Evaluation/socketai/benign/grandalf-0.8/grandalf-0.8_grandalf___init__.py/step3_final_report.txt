  "purpose": "Define the public API of the module by specifying exported submodules.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it assigns a static list to __all__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external calls; no data leaks or security-sensitive sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a static assignment with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python pattern for module exports, assigning a list of submodule names to __all__. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The reports correctly identify the purpose and lack of malicious intent, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious activity are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module API declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
