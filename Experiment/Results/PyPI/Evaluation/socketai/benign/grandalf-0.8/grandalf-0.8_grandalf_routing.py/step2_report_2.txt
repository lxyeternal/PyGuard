  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is purely geometric, involving calculations for routing edges in graph visualizations.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or file I/O are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- Functions manipulate data structures related to visualization (points, edge views) without performing any system modifications or malicious actions.\n- The code relies on a known geometry utility module, performing standard mathematical operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose:** Valid, describes edge routing functions.\n\n**Analysis & conclusion:** The report correctly identifies the code as a geometric utility for routing edges, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security Risk: 0 (correct, no vulnerabilities)\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring is reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose:** Same as above, standard edge routing.\n\n**Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity, purely geometric calculations. The report's confidence (0.95) is appropriate, and the malware/obfuscated scores are correctly 0.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose:** Similar, focusing on routing with rounded corners.\n\n**Analysis & conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; code is purely geometric.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose:** Same, with emphasis on routing algorithms.\n\n**Analysis & conclusion:** The report assigns a security risk of 0.2, citing no malicious code but perhaps a slight concern due to the code's complexity or the use of geometric functions.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n\n- The code is standard geometric visualization code; no network or system operations.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score of 0.2 suggests a minor concern, perhaps over-cautious.\n- The malware score remains 0, which is correct.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- The security risk score could be lowered to 0, as there's no evident vulnerability or malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** The malware and obfuscated scores are correct. The security risk score should be **0** for accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose:** Same as above, no suspicious activity.\n\n**Analysis & conclusion:** The report states no malicious behavior, and the scores reflect that.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description; no issues are found.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:**  \n  - Reports 1-3 and 5 assign 0, which is appropriate.\n  - Report 4 assigns 0.2, which seems slightly high given the code's nature. It should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security risk score:** **0** (no vulnerabilities or suspicious activity)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard geometric utility for graph visualization, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. The functions are straightforward, and the data flows are internal and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Score | Justification                                                 |\n|--------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0            | No malicious actions or code present                          |\n| Obfuscated         | 0            | Clear, straightforward geometric code                        |\n| Security Risk      | 0            | No vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors detected        |\n\nPlease update the security risk score in report 4 to **0** for consistency.",
