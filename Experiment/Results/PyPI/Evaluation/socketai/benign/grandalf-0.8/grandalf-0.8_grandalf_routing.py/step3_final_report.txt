{
  "purpose": "The code provides geometric functions and classes for routing edges in graph visualizations, including straight lines, splines with rounded corners, and custom corner rounding algorithms.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'pts' list of points and object attributes such as 'e.view', 'e.v', and 'e.view.splines'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include modifications to 'e.view.head_angle' and 'e.view.splines', but these are internal data updates without external data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input points ('pts') and object attributes ('e.view') through geometric calculations, updating internal visualization structures without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code performs geometric calculations for edge routing in graph visualization, including intersection, angle, and point generation functions. It manipulates internal data structures related to visualization without external data flow or system modification. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The functions are standard for visualization purposes, and the code relies on known geometry utilities. The only concern is the 'securityRisk' score of 0.2 in report 4, which is an overestimate given the benign nature of the code. All other scores are consistent with the code's purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate geometric utility for graph visualization with no malicious intent or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0. The slight elevation in report 4's risk score is unjustified and should be lowered to 0.",
