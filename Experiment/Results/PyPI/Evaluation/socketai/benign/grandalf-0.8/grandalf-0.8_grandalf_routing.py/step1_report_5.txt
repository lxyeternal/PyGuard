{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and classes for routing edges in a graph visualization, including line and spline routing with corner rounding.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the input parameters such as 'e', 'pts', and imported functions from 'grandalf.utils.geometry'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of functions that generate or modify points, but there are no explicit sinks that perform sensitive operations like network communication, file access, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into geometric calculations and modifications of point lists; no untrusted data sources or dangerous operations are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code uses standard geometric computations and straightforward logic. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a geometric routing module with functions to route edges using lines, splines, and rounded corners. It imports functions from an external geometry utility module, and all operations involve mathematical calculations and point manipulations. There are no signs of data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior. The functions do not perform any network or system modifications, nor do they contain any suspicious code patterns. The only operations involve geometric calculations and list manipulations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign geometric routing utility for graph visualization, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
