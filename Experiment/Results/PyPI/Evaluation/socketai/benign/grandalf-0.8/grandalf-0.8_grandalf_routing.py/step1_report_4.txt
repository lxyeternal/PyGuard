{
  "purpose": "Provides edge routing algorithms and utilities for drawing edges with straight lines, splines, and rounded corners in graph visualizations within the Grandalf library.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from grandalf.utils.geometry; functions such as intersectR, getangle, sqrt; data read from 'e' object attributes like 'view' and 'v'; parameters such as 'pts' list for points.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'e.view' to store routing details; modifies 'pts' list which influences graphical output; no direct data sinks such as network connections or file writes identified.",
  "flows": "Routing functions process input points and 'e' object to compute positions and spline data; flow from input points and 'e' to 'e.view' attributes and modified 'pts'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Functions are consistent with geometric calculations; no obfuscated code or unusual control flow detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines routing algorithms for graph edges, including straight lines, splines, and rounded corners. It performs geometric calculations and updates the 'e.view' object with routing information. Imports are standard utility functions. No external data sources or sinks are used; all data is derived from parameters and internal computations. No malicious behavior or suspicious activities are evident. The code's purpose aligns with visualization tasks, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate component of a graph visualization library, implementing geometric routing algorithms without malicious intent. No security risks or malware indications are present based on this code fragment.",
