{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and classes for routing edges in graph visualizations, including line, spline, and rounded-corner routing algorithms.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources or input reading; functions operate on provided geometric points and objects",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; no external system calls or data leaks",
  "flows": "The code processes geometric points for routing edges, but there are no external data flows or network communications involved",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Functions perform geometric calculations with no hidden actions.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly handles geometric computations for graph edge routing, including functions for generating points, rounding corners, and setting spline curves. It imports geometry utilities from a known module and performs standard calculations. No external data, network access, or system modification code is present. The code appears to be part of a visualization library with legitimate mathematical operations. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of edge routing algorithms used in graph visualization, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical geometric utility module with no malicious or suspicious features.",
