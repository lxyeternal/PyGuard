{
  "purpose": "The code provides edge routing algorithms for graph visualization, including line routing, spline routing with rounded corners, and custom rounded corner algorithms.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from grandalf.utils.geometry; methods such as intersectR, getangle, sqrt, setroundcorner, new_point_at_distance are used, which rely on geometry calculations. No external user input or environment data is directly read.",
  "sinks": "Uses geometric functions and manipulates points; no direct data sinks or network connections. No logging, output, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Geometry functions provide coordinate calculations for routing; functions generate or modify points for drawing edges. No untrusted data flow to external systems or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The code includes only standard geometric calculations and routing logic, with no obfuscated or unusual constructs. No hidden backdoors or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements graph edge routing with geometric calculations, including rounding corners and spline generation. It imports geometry functions from a local module, and the logic involves straightforward mathematical operations for position calculations. No data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The code functions as intended for visual routing without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of edge routing algorithms with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be part of a graph visualization tool and does not perform any harmful or unauthorized actions.",
