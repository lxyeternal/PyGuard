      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard parser for Graphviz dot files with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It processes untrusted input solely for parsing purposes, with no external data exfiltration or harmful operations. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.1 to reflect minimal risk due to untrusted input handling."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The only concern is the use of wildcard imports, which should be replaced with explicit imports for clarity, but this does not impact security. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1 are appropriate."

The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk due to the use of randomness in geometric calculations. No further action is necessary."
