{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the 'grandalf' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Readings from the import statement, string assignment, and the setup() function parameters such as package lists, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could originate from external sources in dependencies, but the setup script itself does not process external input directly.",
  "flows": "The setup() function uses static data for package configuration; there are no dynamic flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs. The script is standard for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py file used to configure Python package installation. It imports setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and data files. There are no indications of code injection, malicious code, or obfuscation. The dependencies listed are common packages (pytest, numpy, ply, pyparsing), and there are no suspicious URLs or functions executing untrusted code. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data leaks. The structure and content are consistent with legitimate package configuration files.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script appears legitimate, standard, and free of malicious behavior. No malware signals or security risks are detected. It is a typical package configuration with no suspicious elements.",
