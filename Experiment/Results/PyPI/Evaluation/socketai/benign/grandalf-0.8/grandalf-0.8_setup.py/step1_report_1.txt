  "purpose": "This script is used to define the setup configuration for the 'grandalf' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and configuration parameters from the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or operations that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "N/A — standard setup configuration; no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs package setup tasks using setuptools, with static metadata and dependency declarations. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors observed. The setup script is conventional and does not include obfuscated or malicious code. Dependencies are standard and benign, and there are no signs of data exfiltration or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no evidence of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It simply defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malware features are present.",
