{
  "purpose": "This setup script is intended to package and distribute the 'grandalf' Python library, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, dependencies, and configuration information; no external inputs or untrusted data sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "The script primarily writes configuration data to setup tools and does not directly write to files or network. No sinks such as network connections or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining metadata and dependencies to passing configuration to the setup() function; there are no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code strictly adheres to standard setup script conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools, specifying package info, dependencies, classifiers, and entry points. It does not process external untrusted data, execute dynamic code, or include suspicious behavior. The dependencies are typical for packaging and testing, and there are no indications of obfuscated or malicious code. The code is clean, straightforward, and well-structured, matching common practices for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for packaging the 'grandalf' library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe for use and distribution.",
