  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the 'grandalf' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the package data, dependencies, and metadata fields; no external input or untrusted sources detected.",
  "sinks": "Uses standard setup tools and dependencies; no sinks that could lead to data leaks, remote code execution, or malicious activities.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; dependency installation flows are standard and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a conventional setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and other configuration details. All elements follow standard practices for Python packaging. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. Dependencies are typical for a project of this nature. The code does not perform any runtime operations or untrusted data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate and safe package setup script.",
