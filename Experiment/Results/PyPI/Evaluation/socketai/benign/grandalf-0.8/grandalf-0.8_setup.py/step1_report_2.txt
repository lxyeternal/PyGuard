{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging and distribution of the 'grandalf' Python project, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'setuptools', variable 'long_descr' containing package description, and setup() function call with various parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the parameters in setup() directly process untrusted input or data from external sources. No external data sinks or network communication are present.",
  "flows": "The script defines static package metadata and configuration; no dynamic data flows or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hard-coded secrets are present. The code appears to be standard packaging configuration code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and defines a descriptive string for the package. The setup() function is called with static metadata, dependencies, and package information. All data appears to be hardcoded or predefined. There are no dynamic or untrusted inputs, no network operations, and no code execution that could be malicious. The dependencies listed are standard and expected for a Python package setup. The code structure is conventional and clean, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign Python setup script used for packaging a project. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no external data handling that could pose security risks.",
