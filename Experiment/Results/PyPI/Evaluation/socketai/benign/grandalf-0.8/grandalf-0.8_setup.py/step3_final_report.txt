{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'grandalf' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup.py script, including package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and package lists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or external data sources; no data sinks or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and follows conventional packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with hardcoded, static parameters. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or obfuscated segments. Dependencies are standard and benign. The structure is typical for a Python package setup script. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The static nature and lack of external input indicate a low security risk. All signals point to a benign, well-formed package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is a standard, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
