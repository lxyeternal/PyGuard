  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .poset import *\nfrom .dot import *\nfrom .nx import *\n```\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is purely composed of relative import statements from three modules: `poset`, `dot`, and `nx`.\n- There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or other operations.\n- The use of wildcard imports (`*`) is generally discouraged because it obscures what is imported, but it is not inherently malicious.\n- Without additional context or the contents of the imported modules, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is just import statements with no anomalies.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Notes the use of wildcard imports, which could hide malicious code, but no actual malicious activity is indicated.\n- Slightly higher confidence (0.6) about potential issues due to wildcard imports.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly cautious but no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to above, minimal code, standard import pattern.\n- Slightly higher confidence (0.9) about benign nature.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion: benign, standard import statements.\n- Confidence 0.9.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same reasoning, benign import statements.\n- Confidence 1.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, appropriate given the straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher in some reports due to wildcard imports, but no actual risk is present.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The wildcard imports are not best practice but do not indicate malicious intent.\n- The scores are consistent with the code snippet.\n- No changes needed based on the current analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk evident)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, consisting solely of module import statements. The use of wildcard imports is a style concern but not a security issue. No evidence suggests malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI agree with the current scores and assessments. The code is safe and does not pose security risks based on the provided snippet.",
