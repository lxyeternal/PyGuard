  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The only concern is the use of wildcard imports, which should be replaced with explicit imports for clarity, but this does not impact security. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1 are appropriate."
