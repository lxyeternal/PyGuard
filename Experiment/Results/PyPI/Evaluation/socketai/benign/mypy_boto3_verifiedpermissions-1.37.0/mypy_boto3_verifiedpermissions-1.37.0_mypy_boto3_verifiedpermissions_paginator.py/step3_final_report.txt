  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the verifiedpermissions service client, enabling type safety and structured pagination support in boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports of type definitions, class inheritance, and method parameters using **kwargs for pagination inputs.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept **kwargs with specific types; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the paginate methods, which return PageIterator objects; no external data or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution present. Conditional import based on Python version is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static class definitions for boto3 paginators, with type annotations and conditional imports for compatibility. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle external data. The structure aligns with auto-generated SDK stub patterns, serving solely for type safety and API pagination. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for boto3 type annotations, and poses no security risks. All signals indicate safe, well-structured boilerplate code with no malicious intent.",
