{
  "purpose": "Define type-annotated paginator classes for verifiedpermissions service client, enabling type-safe iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; code reads version info and defines classes/methods that use input parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any untrusted input sources or sensitive data leaks; no network connections or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "The class methods accept **kwargs with specific types, returning PageIterator objects; no data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to be standard boto3 stub definitions with type annotations. The import of sys for version checking is normal, and the code structure follows typical pattern for boto3 paginators.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and class structures for paginator objects used with boto3 verifiedpermissions client. It uses conditional import for Unpack based on Python version, defines classes with paginate methods following boto3 documentation, and avoids executing any untrusted code or network operations. No suspicious or malicious code elements are present; the logic is straightforward and consistent with open-source SDK stub definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of type annotations and class definitions for boto3 paginators, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It serves as a type-safe interface for paginated API responses.",
