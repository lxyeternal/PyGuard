  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for verifiedpermissions service client to facilitate pagination in boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; class methods calling super().paginate()",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, but potential flow of untrusted data through **kwargs in paginate methods",
  "flows": "User calls paginate with kwargs → kwargs passed to super().paginate → output PageIterator",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code appears to be standard paginator wrapper classes with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes with type annotations for boto3's verifiedpermissions service, including methods for pagination. It imports necessary modules and type definitions, with conditional import of Unpack based on Python version. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The use of **kwargs in paginate methods is standard for pagination and does not introduce risk. Overall, the code is a straightforward, type-annotated paginator class implementation with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured set of paginator classes with type annotations for the verifiedpermissions boto3 client. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
