  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is purely for defining type annotations and paginator classes, with no malicious or suspicious elements. It correctly identifies that the code is static, with no dynamic execution, network calls, or data handling that could be malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0  \n  These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears safe, well-structured, and standard for boto3 stub definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's role in type safety, with no external data processing or suspicious behavior. It notes the code is likely autogenerated, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0  \n  These are reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Reinforces the previous findings, highlighting the code as standard boto3 paginator class definitions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0  \n  Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe and typical for SDK stub files.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms the code is a straightforward, type-annotated paginator class setup with no suspicious patterns or external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0  \n  Valid.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Highlights the code as standard type annotations and class definitions, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0  \n  Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign and serves its purpose for type safety.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is static, auto-generated or boilerplate for boto3 type annotations and paginator classes.\n- **Logic & Reasoning:** No anomalies, no suspicious patterns, no dynamic code, no network or data processing.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are set to 0.0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is purely for static type annotations and class definitions.\n- It does not execute any untrusted code, handle external data insecurely, or contain any malicious logic.\n- The conditional import based on Python version is standard practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a safe, standard implementation of boto3 paginator type annotations, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. The scores are reasonable and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk.",
