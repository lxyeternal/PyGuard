  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility.\n- It outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns.\n- No obfuscation or malware indications.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is benign, static, and straightforward. There are no signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.  \n  **Yes, the issues reported as benign are accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Are there any mistakes or flawed reasoning?**  \n  The reports consistently state that the code is simple, static, and safe. This is accurate.  \n  **No, the reasoning appears sound.**\n\n---\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct given the code.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since the code is purely informational, with no external dependencies, no dynamic code execution, no secrets, and no network activity, the risk score should remain at **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, and their assessments align with the code's nature.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified here.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, I agree with the current scores:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware            | 0      | No malicious activity or code present.                       |\n| obfuscated         | 0      | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.                     |\n| securityRisk       | 0      | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.                        |\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign CLI utility with no security concerns.**",
