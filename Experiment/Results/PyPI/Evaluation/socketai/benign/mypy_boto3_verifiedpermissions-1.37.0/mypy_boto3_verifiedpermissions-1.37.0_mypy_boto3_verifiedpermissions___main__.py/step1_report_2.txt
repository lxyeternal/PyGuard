  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint that displays package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output display.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line args flows into condition check, then output via sys.stdout.write.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution or external connections.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on user input. It imports sys and uses sys.stdout.write for output. There are no external data inputs beyond command-line arguments. No data leaks, code injections, or malicious behavior are present. The code structure is simple and clear, focusing solely on displaying static information. It does not interact with external systems or perform any operations beyond printing predefined strings.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI utility with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply prints static package info and version data based on user input.",
