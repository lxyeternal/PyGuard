  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs package information or version based on command-line arguments. It only reads input from sys.argv and writes static strings to stdout. There are no external data sources, network calls, or executable code. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
