  "purpose": "Provides static package information and version details via CLI.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to stdout.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version; otherwise, print_info outputs static info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line input. It performs no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of sensitive data. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature mean there are no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this script, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The logic is sound, and the scores are consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action is needed.",
