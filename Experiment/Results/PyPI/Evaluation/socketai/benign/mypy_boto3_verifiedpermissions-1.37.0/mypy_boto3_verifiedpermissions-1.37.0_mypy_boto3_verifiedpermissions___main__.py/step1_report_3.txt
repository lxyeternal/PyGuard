{
  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint that provides package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout.write for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data to stdout, which could be manipulated if input was malicious, but in this case, the data is static",
  "flows": "User input (via sys.argv) triggers print_version or print_info, which then write static info to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns; the output is static and informational only.",
  "analysis": "The script serves as a simple CLI tool providing package info and version details. It reads command-line arguments but only processes the '--version' flag to print a static version string. The rest of the output is predefined and static, with no user input manipulation or dynamic data fetching. No external data sources, network calls, or file operations are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package information and version. It contains no malicious behavior, no hidden or suspicious activities, and no security risks based on the provided code.",
