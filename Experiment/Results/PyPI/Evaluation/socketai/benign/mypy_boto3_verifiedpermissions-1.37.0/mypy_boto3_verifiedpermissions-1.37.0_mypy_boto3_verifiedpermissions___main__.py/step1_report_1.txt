  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides information about boto3 VerifiedPermissions library and its version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (input parameters), sys.stdout (printing output)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (writing info to standard output)",
  "flows": "Command-line argument (e.g., '--version') triggers print_version, otherwise print_info is called, both writing to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code simply outputs static information based on command-line arguments.",
  "analysis": "The script functions solely as a CLI utility to display static package info or version. It uses standard libraries and simple control flow. There are no data leaks, network communications, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a benign informational script with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs package information and version details without any malicious intent or security risks.",
