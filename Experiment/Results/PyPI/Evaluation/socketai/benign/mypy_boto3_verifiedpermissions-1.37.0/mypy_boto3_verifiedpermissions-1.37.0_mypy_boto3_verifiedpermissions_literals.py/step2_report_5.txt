  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a static type declaration module, defining string literal types for AWS resource names and verifiedpermissions constants. No runtime logic, data flow, or external input handling. No malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as purely static type annotations, with no security risks or malware indicators. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report is accurate, and the scoring is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code only reads static literals and imports, with no data flow or dynamic behavior. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's nature. The conditional import for Python version compatibility is standard practice, not malicious. The malware and security risk scores are correctly set to zero.\n\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the code defining string literals for AWS services, regions, and paginator names, with no dynamic code or external data handling. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is purely declarative, intended for type checking, with no malicious indicators. The scores are appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict:** Correct assessment and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the code's purpose as static type definitions, with conditional import for compatibility, and no untrusted data or dynamic logic.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code. The scores are appropriate given the static, benign nature.\n\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing that the code is static, for type safety, with no dynamic or untrusted data handling, and no malicious intent.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning matches the code content. The scores are justified.\n\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a static set of type annotations using Literal, with conditional imports for Python compatibility. No functions, data processing, or runtime logic.\n\n- **Malware and Security Risk:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is accurate. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; all code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the static nature, the risk scores are appropriately low (0.0 or 0.5 at most if considering any minimal concern), but the reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the static, non-executable nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate, and the code is benign.**\n\n---\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0  \n\nThe code is purely static type annotations with no security concerns.",
