{
  "purpose": "Defines static type literals for verifiedpermissions and AWS resource identifiers, serving as type annotations for SDK constants.",
  "sources": "Static string literals and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static type declarations with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static type alias definitions using Literal for various AWS service, resource, and permission identifiers. It includes a conditional import for compatibility with different Python versions. There is no runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling. The code is purely declarative, intended for type checking and documentation support. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, secrets, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static set of type annotations for AWS SDK constants, with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate benign, well-structured, and purpose-specific code.",
