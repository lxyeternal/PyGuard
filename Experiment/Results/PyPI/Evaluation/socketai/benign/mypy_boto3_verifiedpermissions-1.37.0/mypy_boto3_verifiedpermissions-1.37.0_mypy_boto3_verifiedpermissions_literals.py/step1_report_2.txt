{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations and literal types for verifiedpermissions service and related AWS service identifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads only from the static string literals and imports; no external data inputs or user data handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows to critical functions or external systems; no data leaks or code execution points detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code is purely type annotation definitions and conditional imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The code is straightforward and purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then defines a series of string literal types representing various AWS resource, service, and paginator names. The type annotations are used for static type checking. There are no dynamic code executions, no external data inputs, no function calls, and no suspicious logic. All data is static, and the structure follows standard type hinting patterns for large-scale SDKs. No malware indicators, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static type definitions module intended for type checking and documentation purposes. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is to provide accurate type annotations for AWS-related constants, and it does so in a safe manner.",
