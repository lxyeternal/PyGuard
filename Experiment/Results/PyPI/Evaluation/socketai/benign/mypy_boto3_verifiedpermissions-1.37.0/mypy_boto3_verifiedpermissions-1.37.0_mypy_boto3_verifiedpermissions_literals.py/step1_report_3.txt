  "purpose": "Define string literal types for verifiedpermissions service and related AWS resource and operation names.",
  "sources": "Literal string definitions for various AWS service, resource, region, and paginator names.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code only defines constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static type definitions with no runtime behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior. The code is straightforward and solely consists of type alias declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Literal type from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version, then defines multiple string literal types representing AWS services, regions, resources, and pagination names. The purpose is to provide type annotations for boto3 stubs. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or data processing. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are present. The code strictly adheres to static type definitions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard set of type annotations for AWS service identifiers used in boto3. It contains no malicious intent, no code injection, and no security risks. It is safe and purely declarative.",
