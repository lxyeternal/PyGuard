  "purpose": "Define and export type literals for verifiedpermissions service and related AWS resource identifiers.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and string literals defining acceptable values for various service-related types and resource names.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only defines constants and type aliases without processing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward, providing static literals and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of type definitions using Literal for value constraints, conditional import for compatibility, and a comprehensive list of AWS resource names and identifiers. It contains no runtime logic, user input handling, or external data processing. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code segments are present. The license and documentation comments are benign. Overall, this appears to be a safe, static type declaration module intended for type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static type definition module without malicious intent or security risks. It only provides literal types and annotations for AWS and verifiedpermissions-related constants, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
