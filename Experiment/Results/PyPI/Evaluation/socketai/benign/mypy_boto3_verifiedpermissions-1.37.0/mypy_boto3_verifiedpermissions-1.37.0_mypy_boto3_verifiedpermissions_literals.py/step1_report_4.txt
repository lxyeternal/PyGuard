{
  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for verifiedpermissions service and related constants for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions, and local definitions of string literal types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; primarily static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of conditional import based on Python version is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, providing string literal type definitions for a Python SDK or library. It includes conditional import for compatibility with different Python versions, which is normal. No dynamic execution, external data fetching, or sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be a static, well-structured set of type annotations and constants. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation. No external or untrusted sources involved, and no suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, static type definitions for SDK constants, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
