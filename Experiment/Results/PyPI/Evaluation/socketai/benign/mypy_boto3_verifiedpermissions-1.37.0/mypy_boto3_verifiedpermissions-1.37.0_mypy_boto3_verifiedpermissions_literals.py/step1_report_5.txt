{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for verifiedpermissions service and related AWS resource and operation names to facilitate type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; all definitions are static string literals for type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code consists solely of static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, defining string literal types for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code includes license/comment headers, imports sys to check Python version, and conditionally imports Literal accordingly. It defines multiple constants as Literal types, including error codes, decision types, paginator names, AWS resource names, regions, and service names. All definitions are static string literals, with no dynamic or untrusted data handling, code execution, or data leaks present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for static type annotations, providing string literal types for AWS and verified permissions service enums. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured module for type safety.",
