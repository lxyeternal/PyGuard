{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and data structures for the VerifiedPermissions service, facilitating type checking and data validation within the SDK.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class definitions, and imports primarily read static class and type information. No data input sources are evident; the code mainly declares data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data or perform system operations are present. The code does not process or execute external input or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; the code only defines data schemas and type aliases without runtime logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes extensive type definitions with some conditional imports based on Python version. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic execution are present. No obfuscated code features are detected. No signs of malicious privacy violations or secret exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining TypedDict structures, unions, and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It imports standard libraries and external type extensions for Python <3.12. Only type definitions for a service are included, with no runtime logic, data handling, or network operations. The absence of executable code, input/output handling, or dynamic behavior indicates a non-malicious, static codebase focused on type safety.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, static type annotation module providing data structure definitions for the VerifiedPermissions SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code appears safe and intentionally designed for static type checking purposes.",
