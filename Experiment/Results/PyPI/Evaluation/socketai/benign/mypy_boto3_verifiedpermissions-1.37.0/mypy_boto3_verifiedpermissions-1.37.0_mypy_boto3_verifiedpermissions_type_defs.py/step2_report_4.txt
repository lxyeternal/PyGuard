  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely static type definitions for the verifiedpermissions service, with no runtime logic or external interactions.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no dynamic code, no secrets, no network calls.\n- **Assessment:** Completely safe, standard type annotations, possibly auto-generated.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is for static type checking, with no runtime data processing.\n- **Findings:** No data sinks, no dynamic behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Safe, straightforward type definitions, standard compatibility handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines type annotations for the SDK, with no runtime logic or external interactions.\n- **Findings:** No executable code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Static, safe, typical for SDK type annotations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, purely type annotations with standard imports and conditional compatibility code.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no dynamic code, no secrets.\n- **Assessment:** Static, benign, standard practice.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Declares data structures for API schema, with no executable logic.\n- **Findings:** No runtime code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Static, safe, typical for SDK type definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is static type annotations and data structure definitions with no runtime logic, external data handling, or malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the static nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of runtime or external risks.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is purely declarative, serving as static type annotations for a Python SDK.\n- No dynamic execution, external data processing, or network calls are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are detected.\n- Conditional imports are standard for compatibility, not obfuscation.\n- The structure and purpose align with typical auto-generated or manually written SDK type definitions.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is safe, well-structured, and free from malicious intent.",
