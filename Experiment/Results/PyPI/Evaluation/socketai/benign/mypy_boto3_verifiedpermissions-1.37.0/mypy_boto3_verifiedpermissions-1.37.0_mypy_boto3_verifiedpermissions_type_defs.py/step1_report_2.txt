{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for the verifiedpermissions service, used for static type checking and API schema validation.",
  "sources": "Constant imports, sys.version_info checks, and type annotation assignments; no runtime input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no network, file, or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; mainly static type definitions and structure declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. The use of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and conditional imports based on Python version. It does not perform runtime data processing, input reading, or system calls. No indications of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. The structure is consistent with auto-generated or schema-defining code for static type checking. No signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of type definitions for API data structures, with no malicious or security-compromising behavior. It is safe and intended for static type validation purposes.",
