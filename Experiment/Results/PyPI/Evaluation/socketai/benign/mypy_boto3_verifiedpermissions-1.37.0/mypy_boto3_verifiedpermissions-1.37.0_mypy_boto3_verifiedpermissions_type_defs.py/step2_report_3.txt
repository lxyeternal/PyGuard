  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the provided code to determine the accuracy of their assessments, the potential security implications, and whether any adjustments to the scores are warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- The code consists solely of static type definitions using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No functions, runtime logic, data processing, or external system interactions are present.\n- Imports are from standard libraries and external type extension modules, with no dynamic code execution.\n- The purpose appears to be defining data schemas for a Python SDK or API client.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are evident.\n- The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Each Report**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Claim:** Static type annotations, no runtime logic, no external interactions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is purely declarative, with no runtime execution or data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Claim:** Type definitions, no runtime input/output, no suspicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is static, with conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Claim:** Static type annotations, no runtime logic, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code only defines data structures.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Claim:** Type annotations, no external data processing, no malicious code, standard compatibility patterns.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is purely declarative with no runtime or dynamic behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Claim:** Static data structure definitions, no executable logic, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations for API schemas.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify that the code contains no malicious behavior. The code is purely static type definitions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is present; the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Since there is no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions, the security risk remains negligible.\n\n**Any higher scores would be unjustified** given the static, declarative nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Estimate**\n\n| Metric             | Suggested Score | Justification                                               |\n|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0                 | No malicious code, no dynamic execution, no external calls. |\n| Obfuscated         | 0                 | Code is clear, well-structured, and straightforward.        |\n| Security Risk      | 0                 | No runtime logic, no external data handling, no secrets.   |\n\n---\n\n**Final Note:**  \nThis code is a standard, static type annotation module intended for static analysis and type checking. It is free from malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing assessments are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
