  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for verifiedpermissions service in Python, primarily for type safety, documentation, and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Constant imports, sys.version_info checks for conditional imports, class and variable definitions, including all type annotations, import statements, and class inheritance.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains data sinks that process untrusted external input directly; mainly type definitions, imports, and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily defines data structures and conditional imports.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional imports based on sys.version_info, but this is standard for compatibility; no signs of obfuscated or suspicious code behavior. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no network operations. The code is purely type annotation and data structure definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on defining TypedDict classes, type aliases, and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. The imports are from standard libraries and external type extension packages, with no evidence of malicious logic. The class and variable names are descriptive, aligning with expected service data types. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or hardcoded secrets are present. The only notable complexity is conditional imports based on Python version, which is a common compatibility pattern. Overall, it appears to be standard, benign code dedicated to type safety and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of type definitions and imports used for a Python SDK or service interface. It contains no suspicious, malicious, or maliciously intended code segments. The structure is typical for type annotations and does not pose any security threats.",
