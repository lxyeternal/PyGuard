{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type definitions for the verifiedpermissions SDK, serving as data schemas for type checking and API interactions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from type annotations, imported literals, and conditional imports based on Python version; no runtime data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external data handling points; the code is purely declarative with no runtime data processing.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows at runtime; the code only defines data structures without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. Conditional imports are standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It contains no functions, runtime logic, external interactions, or secrets. The structure is consistent with auto-generated or manually maintained SDK schemas. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static set of type annotations and data schemas intended for type safety and validation within the SDK. It contains no malicious elements, external system interactions, or obfuscation. The security and malware scores are correctly set to 0, and the overall risk is negligible.",
