{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for verifiedpermissions service data structures used in a Python SDK or API client.",
  "sources": "Module imports, type definitions, and class declarations; primarily from standard libraries and local modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks of untrusted data or external interactions; type definitions are static and used for type checking only.",
  "flows": "Type annotations and class definitions do not process or transfer data at runtime; they serve for static analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, such as dynamic execution, network calls, or handling of sensitive data. All code is static type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of TypedDict and Union definitions for data structures used in the verifiedpermissions service. It imports from standard libraries, conditional imports based on Python version, and type extension modules. There are no functions executing runtime logic, no data processing, and no external system interactions. All elements are static type annotations meant for type checking, which minimizes the risk of malicious behavior. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious data handling. The initial import of sys and conditional imports are benign. Overall, this is a well-structured, non-executable type definition module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely static type annotations defining data structures for a Python SDK, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions that could indicate malicious intent. It appears to be a safe, standard, auto-generated or manually crafted type definition module without malicious behavior.",
