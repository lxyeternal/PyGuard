  "purpose": "Define and expose the version string of a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or sensitive sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from input to output or to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a simple version assignment with a comment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a comment, a copyright statement, and a straightforward assignment of a version string to the __version__ variable. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no suspicious or malicious operations. The structure and content are typical for a version definition in a Python package, with no obfuscation or hidden code. The version string is hardcoded, which is standard practice. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
