  "purpose": "Define the version of the package in a standard manner.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of the string '1.37.0' to __version__",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs involved",
  "flows": "None; static assignment without data flow from external sources",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static assignment of a version string to __version__, accompanied by a comment and copyright notice. It contains no input sources, data flows, dynamic code, or external interactions. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present. The code is typical boilerplate for versioning in Python packages, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent and appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are justified and no modifications are necessary.",
