  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze whether the conclusions and scores are appropriate.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe a very simple, static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No input sources, external data, or dynamic code are involved.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- The code is typical boilerplate for Python package versioning.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the issues in the code:\n- The code snippets are straightforward and match the descriptions.\n- No issues are present in the code itself; the code is benign.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly identify the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `confidence`: 1 (fully confident)\n  - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n  - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n  - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n\nThese scores are reasonable given the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is just a static version string assignment with no external input, no data flow, and no suspicious behavior, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The malware score is also correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is standard boilerplate, which appears correct.\n- No assumptions about hidden or malicious code are justified here.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a simple, benign version declaration with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate scoring. No changes are needed.",
