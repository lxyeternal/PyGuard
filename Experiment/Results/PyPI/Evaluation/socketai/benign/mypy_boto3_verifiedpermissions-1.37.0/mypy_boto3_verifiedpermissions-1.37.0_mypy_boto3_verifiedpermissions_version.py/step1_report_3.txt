{
  "purpose": "Define the version string for the package or module, serving as a source of truth for the version number.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ = \"1.37.0\"",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present",
  "flows": "The version string assignment does not involve data flow from external sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple version assignment and license comment",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a copyright comment, a version string assignment, and no other logic or data processing. The version string is hardcoded with a static value, and the comment indicates the author and year. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard version declaration commonly found in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. It is typical boilerplate code used for package versioning.",
