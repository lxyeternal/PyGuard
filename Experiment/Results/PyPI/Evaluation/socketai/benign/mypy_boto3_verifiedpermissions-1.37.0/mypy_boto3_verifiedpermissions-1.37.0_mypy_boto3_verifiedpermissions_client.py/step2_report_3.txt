  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, potential security implications, and scoring consistency.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a type-annotated SDK stub for AWS Verified Permissions, with no executable logic, data sinks, or malicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 aligns with the absence of executable or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound, and the scoring is reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's role as a type-safe interface with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is justified.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 might be slightly high given no actual runtime or network activity, but considering the potential misuse of methods like `generate_presigned_url`, a minimal risk score (e.g., 0.1) can be acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is solid, and the scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Focuses on the code as a standard boto3 stub with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 is reasonable, considering the method signatures could be misused if combined with malicious inputs, but the code itself is safe.\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis and scoring are consistent and justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Recognizes the code as purely interface definitions with no executable or malicious logic.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, as there's no evident security concern.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly states that the code is a standard interface with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is justified.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, given the absence of runtime logic or external effects.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning and scoring are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Presence of Issues:** No actual issues or malicious code are present in the provided code snippet.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign an obfuscated score of 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's nature as a static interface/stub with no runtime logic, a low risk score (around 0 to 0.1) is appropriate. Some reports use 0.1, which is reasonable considering potential misuse of certain methods like presigned URL generation, but the code itself is benign.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal risk, mostly theoretical if methods are misused)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured SDK stub for AWS Verified Permissions, with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores across reports are consistent with the code's nature.",
