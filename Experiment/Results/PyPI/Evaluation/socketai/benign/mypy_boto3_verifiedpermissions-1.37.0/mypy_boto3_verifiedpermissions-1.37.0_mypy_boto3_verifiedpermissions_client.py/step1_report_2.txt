  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class for interacting with the AWS VerifiedPermissions service via boto3.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class and method definitions, property declarations, type annotations, and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no places where untrusted data flows into security-sensitive operations or external effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks identified; code primarily defines interface and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a well-structured client interface for AWS VerifiedPermissions, including type annotations, property and method definitions, and documentation links. It imports necessary modules and conditionally imports based on Python version. All functions are standard boto3 client methods with appropriate type hints and docstrings. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code appears to be an SDK wrapper and does not perform any runtime operations beyond interface declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SDK interface for AWS VerifiedPermissions with no evidence of malicious behavior. It is a purely declarative module for type hints and client method definitions, posing no security risks.",
