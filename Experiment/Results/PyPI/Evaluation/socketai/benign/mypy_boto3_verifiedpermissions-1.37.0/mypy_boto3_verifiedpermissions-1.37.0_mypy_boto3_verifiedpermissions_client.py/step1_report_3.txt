{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the verifiedpermissions service in boto3-stubs, providing type hints and documentation links for improved code assistance.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attribute definitions, method parameters and return types, property accessors, and type overloads.",
  "sinks": "Method calls, property accesses, and data unpacking in method signatures; no actual data processing or external calls within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Input sources include method parameters and property accessors; sinks are method implementations and property returns; data flows through method parameters, especially those unpacked from type definitions, but actual runtime behavior is not present in this static code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic detected. The code appears to be standard boto3 client stub definitions with no unusual code structures or obfuscated elements. Documentation links and type annotations are consistent with standard boto3 practices.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and class structures for a boto3 client, including method signatures, property definitions, and overloads for paginators. It leverages type hints, conditional imports based on Python version, and static class attribute definitions for exception types. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or hidden code. The code appears to be auto-generated or boilerplate stub code for type checking, with no runtime logic or data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious set of type annotations and client interface definitions for the verifiedpermissions AWS service. It contains no suspicious or harmful behavior and is consistent with typical boto3 stub modules. Therefore, the malware score is very low, and the security risk is minimal.",
