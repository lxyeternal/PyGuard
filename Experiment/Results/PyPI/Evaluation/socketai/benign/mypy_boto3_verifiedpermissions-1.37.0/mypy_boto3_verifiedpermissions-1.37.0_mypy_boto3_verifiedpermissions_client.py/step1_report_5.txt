  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for verifiedpermissions service, facilitating interaction with AWS Verified Permissions via boto3.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class and method definitions, type annotations, string literals in method signatures, and property definitions.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that invoke AWS SDK operations, property getters, and potentially exposed parameters that could be used in malicious payloads if misused.",
  "flows": "Method calls that translate to AWS API requests, with parameters provided by user or calling code; no untrusted data processing within this code itself.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. All method implementations delegate to boto3 and botocore. The code appears to be purely type annotations and client interface definitions, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a boto3 client class with associated type annotations, method signatures, and property definitions for interacting with AWS Verified Permissions. It imports necessary modules, handles Python version differences, and defines an exception class. No untrusted input processing, network calls, or malicious payloads are embedded in this code. Its purpose is to serve as a type-safe interface for the AWS SDK, with method signatures matching the underlying API. There are no suspicious constructs, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured interface definition for AWS Verified Permissions, designed to facilitate type-safe SDK usage. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely as a client interface with no embedded executable logic beyond method signatures and type annotations.",
