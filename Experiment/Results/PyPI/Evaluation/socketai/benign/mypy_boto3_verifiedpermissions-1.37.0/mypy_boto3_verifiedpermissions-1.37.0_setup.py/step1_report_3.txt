  "purpose": "This script sets up the Python package 'mypy-boto3-verifiedpermissions' for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports setup from setuptools; defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data outputs or network connections present.",
  "flows": "Reads local file for long description → passes static package metadata to setup function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, involving reading a local README file and providing static metadata for package distribution. There are no input/output streams involving untrusted data, no network activity, and no code that manipulates data in a suspicious manner. The dependencies are fixed and explicit, and no sensitive information is handled dynamically. Overall, the script adheres to standard practices for package setup without any signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions solely to configure package metadata for distribution.",
