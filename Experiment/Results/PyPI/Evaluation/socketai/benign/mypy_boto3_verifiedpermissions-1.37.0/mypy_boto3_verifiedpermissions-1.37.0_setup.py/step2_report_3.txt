  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the provided code is a standard Python setup script for packaging, with no dynamic code, user input, or network activity. The code reads a static README.md file and calls `setuptools.setup()` with fixed metadata, which is typical and safe.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**  \nNo report indicates any errors or mistakes in the code logic. The code appears correct and follows standard practices. The only minor note is that the URL points to \"https://github.com/youtype/mypy_boto3_builder\" which may be a typo or an unrelated project, but this is not a security concern.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**  \n- **Malware Score (all reports):** 0  \n  Consistently, all reports find no malicious activity, code obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. This is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  Correct, as there's no obfuscation or code hiding.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** 0  \n  The code does not process untrusted data, perform dynamic operations, or contain vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Claims about Vulnerabilities & Assumptions**  \nAll reports correctly dismiss any potential vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, given the static and straightforward nature of the script.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores**  \nThe scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe script is a minimal, static setup configuration with no code execution, data processing, or external interactions that could introduce security risks. The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a typical, safe Python package setup script. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
