  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, imports setup from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Usage is standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution. It reads a local file for the long description and specifies dependencies conditionally based on Python version. There are no network operations, user inputs, or dynamic code execution. All code follows typical setup script conventions. No malicious behaviors or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and straightforward.",
