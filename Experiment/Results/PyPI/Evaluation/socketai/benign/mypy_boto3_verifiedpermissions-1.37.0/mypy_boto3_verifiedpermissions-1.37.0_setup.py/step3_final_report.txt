{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a library, reading a static README.md for description, and calling setuptools.setup() with fixed metadata. It serves to configure package distribution without executing dynamic code or handling untrusted input.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static import of setuptools.setup; static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Static data flow from reading the README.md to passing parameters to setup(); no external or untrusted data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and follows standard packaging practices. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static operations: reading a local file and calling setup() with fixed arguments. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero. The code's simplicity and adherence to common conventions confirm its safety. No vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its safety, and the current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
