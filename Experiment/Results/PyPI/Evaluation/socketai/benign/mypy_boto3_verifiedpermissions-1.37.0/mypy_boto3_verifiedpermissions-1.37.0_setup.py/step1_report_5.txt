{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-verifiedpermissions package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ to load README.md, importing setup from setuptools, and defining static configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the code reads untrusted input or data at runtime; no data is transmitted or processed dynamically.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations. The script only loads static configuration and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns. The script uses standard setup procedures, static paths, and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks such as reading a README file, defining package metadata, and specifying dependencies. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. All imported modules are standard, and no hardcoded credentials or secrets are detected. The code appears straightforward and aligns with common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain any malware, obfuscation, or suspicious code segments. The overall security risk is negligible.",
