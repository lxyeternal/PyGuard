  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a library.\n   - It reads a static README.md file for the long description.\n   - It calls `setuptools.setup()` with fixed metadata, dependencies, and package data.\n   - No dynamic code, user input, network calls, or data processing occurs.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Risks & Malware**:\n   - The code does not process untrusted data.\n   - It does not perform any operations that could be malicious, such as executing external code, network activity, or manipulating data.\n   - All dependencies are explicitly specified and static.\n   - The script is a typical setup configuration, following standard practices.\n\n3. **Review of the Provided Reports**:\n   - All five reports agree that the script is straightforward, with no anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious intent.\n   - They consistently rate the malware and security risk scores as zero.\n   - They do not identify any obfuscation or vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Scores Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious activity, code, or behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — Code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - Given the consistent findings, there is no reason to assign higher scores.\n   - The code's purpose is purely for package setup, which is inherently low risk.\n\n6. **Final Expert Judgment**:\n   - The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n   - The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nBased on the detailed review, the code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware**: **0**  \n- **Obfuscated**: **0**  \n- **Risk**: **0**\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the script, aligning with all the reports and the code analysis.",
