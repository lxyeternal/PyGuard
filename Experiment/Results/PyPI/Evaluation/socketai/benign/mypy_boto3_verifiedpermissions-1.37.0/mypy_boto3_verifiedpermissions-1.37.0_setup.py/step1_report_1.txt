  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-verifiedpermissions package, used for installation and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; no other data inputs or user input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the script primarily defines package metadata and configuration without data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed; straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a static README file, and calls setup() with fixed package metadata. There are no external data sources, no code execution, and no potentially malicious code or backdoors. It uses standard packaging practices. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or harmful behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for package installation. No malicious intent, no security risks identified, and no anomalies suggesting sabotage or malware.",
