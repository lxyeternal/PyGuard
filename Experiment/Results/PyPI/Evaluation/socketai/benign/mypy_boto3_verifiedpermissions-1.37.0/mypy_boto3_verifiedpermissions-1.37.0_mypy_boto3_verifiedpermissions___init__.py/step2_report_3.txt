  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a simple, static module that imports classes from local modules, defines an alias, and sets up `__all__`.  \n- No report mentions any dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or data processing involving untrusted sources.  \n- The code contains only documentation and straightforward import/export logic.  \n- The copyright year is 2025, which is in the future, but this is not inherently suspicious—it could be a placeholder or a typo.  \n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present in any report.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  No. All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, data leaks, or security flaws.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify the code as a standard interface module with no security issues.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate given the code. The confidence scores are high (1), consistent with the thorough analysis.\n\n- **Is the malware score justified?**  \n  Yes. The code shows no malicious activity, so malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Are any claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on observable code behavior.\n\n- **Are the scores consistent?**  \n  Yes. All scores align with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Additional considerations:**  \n- The only minor anomaly is the future year (2025) in the copyright, but this is not a security concern.  \n- The code is a typical SDK interface module, with no signs of tampering or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed reviews, the code is a benign, standard module that provides class references and documentation for the verifiedpermissions service. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The initial report scores are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
