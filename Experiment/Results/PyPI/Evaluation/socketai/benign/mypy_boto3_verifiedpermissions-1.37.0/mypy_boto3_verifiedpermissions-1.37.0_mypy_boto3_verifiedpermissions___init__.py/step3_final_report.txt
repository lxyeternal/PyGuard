  "purpose": "Provides interface setup and documentation for the verifiedpermissions service client.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules (.client and .paginator), documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and module exports; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year '2025' is unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes from local modules, defines an alias, and sets __all__ for exports. The documentation string provides usage instructions. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The only minor anomaly is the future year '2025' in the copyright statement, which does not impact security. All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and securityRisk: 0 are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard interface module for the verifiedpermissions service, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
