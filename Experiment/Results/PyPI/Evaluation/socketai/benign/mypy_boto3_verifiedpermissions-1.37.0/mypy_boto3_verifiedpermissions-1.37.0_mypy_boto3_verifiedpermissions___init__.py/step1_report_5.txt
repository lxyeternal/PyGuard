{
  "purpose": "Provides the main interface for the verifiedpermissions service, including imports and documentation for usage.",
  "sources": "Import statements, string docstring with usage example",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted input or data handling present",
  "flows": "None; the code does not process data flows or handle external inputs",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors; only standard import and documentation",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module imports, documentation, and variable definitions. It imports classes from local modules and defines a client alias and export list. There are no data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The usage example is within a string docstring and not executable code. The overall structure is standard for a Python package interface, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign interface module for a Python SDK component. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It is a clean, documentation-focused module with no suspicious patterns.",
