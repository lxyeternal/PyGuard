  "malware": 0,

  "securityRisk": 0.2,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "purpose": "A pytest plugin integrating mypy static type checking, managing configuration, file collection, caching, and error reporting.",
  "sources": "Configuration options, filesystem reads/writes, subprocess calls to mypy.api.run(), cache files, and session data.",
  "sinks": "Writes to cache files, temporary files, and terminal output for error reports.",
  "flows": "Configuration and file inputs into mypy API; errors and results cached; errors reported via terminal.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured pytest plugin for static analysis. It manages configuration, caching with file locks, invokes mypy API safely, and reports errors. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. It handles files and subprocesses responsibly, with proper error handling. The overall design aligns with typical static analysis tooling, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and intended for static analysis within pytest. It shows no malicious or obfuscated behavior, and the low risk score reflects standard operational risks associated with filesystem and subprocess interactions.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
