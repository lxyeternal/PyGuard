  "purpose": "This code provides a pytest plugin to run mypy static type checking within pytest tests, caching results, and reporting errors.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration options, file paths, and mypy output from subprocess calls; accesses session items, config stash, and file system for caching results.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes mypy results to disk, reads from configuration files, and outputs error messages and reports via pytest terminal reporter.",
  "flows": "Reads input options and config (sources), executes mypy via subprocess, caches results, reads cached results, and reports errors (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code executes mypy subprocesses and handles files normally. No obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script is a pytest plugin designed to run mypy static analysis on Python files during testing. It manages configuration options, caches results to disk with locking, and reports errors in pytest output. The code handles file paths and subprocess calls securely, with proper exception handling for file operations. It uses standard libraries and known third-party libraries (pytest, mypy, filelock). No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or backdoors. The subprocess invocation is controlled by mypy options, and the only output is mypy errors, which are formatted for reporting. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate static analysis integration without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest plugin for running mypy checks, managing cache, and reporting errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The only actions involve executing mypy subprocesses, file I/O, and reporting errors within pytest. It appears safe and intentional for its purpose.",
