  "purpose": "A pytest plugin integrating mypy static type checking and reporting within pytest test runs.",
  "sources": "Configuration options, command-line arguments, file input (reading mypy results, temporary file creation, reading code files), and network-like interactions are not present. No external input reading or network communication observed.",
  "sinks": "File operations for reading/writing mypy results, creating temporary files, and JSON serialization of results. No data leaks or unsafe SQL or code injections detected. No network or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Results are generated via mypy API and saved to local files. Results are loaded from these files and used for reporting. No external untrusted data flow from user input or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior identified. The code appears standard for a pytest plugin managing mypy results. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a pytest plugin for static type checking with mypy. It manages configuration via command-line options, creates temporary files for caching mypy results, uses file locks to prevent race conditions, and reads/writes JSON-formatted cached results. The plugin reports mypy errors and statuses in pytest test reports. No evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or privacy violations. The code handles local filesystem operations and mypy API interactions securely. No network activity or suspicious system commands are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate pytest plugin for running mypy static analysis with no malicious intent. It uses standard patterns for configuration, caching, and reporting. No signs of malware or security risks are identified.",
