  "purpose": "The code is intended to specify pytest plugin configuration and report a version header for mypy.",
  "sources": "Import statement for mypy.version",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data usage or external output sources",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and returns a static string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple import and string formatting without any suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific module from mypy to access its version information, then defines a pytest plugin variable and a report header function that returns a formatted string with mypy's version. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or security risks. The code appears to be for configuration or informational purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to integrate mypy version info into pytest reports. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
