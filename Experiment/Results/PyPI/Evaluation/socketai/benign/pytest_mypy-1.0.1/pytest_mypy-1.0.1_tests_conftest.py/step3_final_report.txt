  "purpose": "The code imports mypy.version and defines a pytest plugin function to report the mypy version during testing.",
  "sources": "Import statement for mypy.version",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external effects",
  "flows": "Import of mypy.version to pytest_report_header function returning version info",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal pytest plugin that reports the mypy version by importing mypy.version and returning its version string. It contains no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and purpose are clear, and no anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward pytest plugin snippet used solely for reporting the mypy version. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
