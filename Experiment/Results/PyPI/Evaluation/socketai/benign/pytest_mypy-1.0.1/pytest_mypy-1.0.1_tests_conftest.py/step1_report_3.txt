  "purpose": "The code is used to integrate mypy version information into pytest reports.",
  "sources": "Importing mypy.version to access version info; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply retrieves version info and returns a static string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports mypy.version to access the mypy package's version information and defines a pytest plugin variable and a report header function. The report header function returns a string containing the mypy version. It does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or execute untrusted code. The usage is straightforward and typical for plugin metadata or reporting purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, standard for plugin reporting, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
