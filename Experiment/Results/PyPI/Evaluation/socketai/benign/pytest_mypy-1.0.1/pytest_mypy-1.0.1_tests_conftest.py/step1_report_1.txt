{
  "purpose": "The code imports the mypy.version module and defines a pytest plugin to display mypy version information in pytest reports.",
  "sources": "Import statement: import mypy.version",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process or output untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely accesses version info and defines a report header",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific module to retrieve version information and defines a pytest plugin function that formats and returns version data for reporting purposes. There are no input/output handling or network operations, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. The code appears straightforward and benign, serving primarily for reporting version info during tests.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, harmless plugin for pytest that reports mypy version information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
