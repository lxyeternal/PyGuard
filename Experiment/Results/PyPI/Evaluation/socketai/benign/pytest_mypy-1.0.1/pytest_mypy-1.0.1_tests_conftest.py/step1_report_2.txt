  "purpose": "The code imports a specific version attribute from the 'mypy' package and defines a pytest plugin hook to report the mypy version in test reports.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'mypy.version' module and its '__version__' attribute.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code reads the version information from 'mypy.version.__version__' and returns it as a formatted string; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports version information from a well-known package and uses it in a reporting function for pytest. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The code is straightforward and standard for reporting tool versions during testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior detected. It only reports the version of 'mypy' during testing, which is a normal operation.",
