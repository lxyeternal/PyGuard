{
  "purpose": "The code imports a specific version attribute from the mypy library and defines a function to return a pytest report header string containing the mypy version.",
  "sources": "Import statement: import mypy.version; Function: pytest_report_header() that accesses mypy.version.__version__",
  "sinks": "The code only reads version information; it does not write or transmit data outside the scope of generating a report header.",
  "flows": "The version information flows from the mypy.version module into the pytest_report_header() function to generate a string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious actions detected. Usage of version info is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the version info from the mypy package and uses it in a simple function to create a header string for pytest reports. There is no user input, data exfiltration, or malicious logic involved. The import is direct and straightforward, and the function returns a formatted string. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely for reporting the mypy version in pytest output. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
