  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent Oracle database interaction library with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low risk score assigned in the reports (around 0.1-0.2) is appropriate, considering the potential misuse if untrusted inputs are passed, but this is typical for such utility libraries. No modifications to the scores are necessary."
