  "purpose": "This code serves as package metadata, including SPDX license identifiers, copyright, and version information.",
  "sources": "Static comments and the assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static metadata only.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of functions, input/output, or dynamic code; straightforward metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of license comments and a version string assignment. No executable code, input/output, or dynamic behavior is present. The static nature and lack of suspicious patterns indicate no malicious intent or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no security risks or malware. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless package metadata header with no security concerns or malicious activity. All assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
