  "flows": "No data flow; no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of SPDX identifiers and hardcoded version are standard; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of metadata annotations and a version variable assignment, which are common in Python packages. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The SPDX comments indicate license and copyright information, standard for open-source projects. No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package metadata header with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It contains no executable logic or sensitive data.",
