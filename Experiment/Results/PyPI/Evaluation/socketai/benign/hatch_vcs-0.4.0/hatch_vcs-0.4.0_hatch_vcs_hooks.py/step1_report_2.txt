{
  "purpose": "The code registers version source, build hook, and metadata hook plugins for the Hatch build system, facilitating versioning and build metadata collection.",
  "sources": "Imports from hatchling.plugin and hatch_vcs modules; function return statements",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "Imports are static; functions simply return class references without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; standard plugin registration pattern",
  "analysis": "The code imports plugin registration decorators and classes related to version control system (VCS) hooks. It defines three functions decorated with @hookimpl, each returning a specific class responsible for versioning, build, or metadata hooks. These functions facilitate plugin registration within the Hatch build system. No input handling, data processing, or external communication is present. The code structure is straightforward, standard for plugin registration, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard plugin registration module for Hatch build system, with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
