  "purpose": "Registering hooks for versioning, build, and metadata in the hatch plugin system.",
  "sources": "Import statements for classes and functions from hatch_vcs modules; the three functions decorated with @hookimpl returning class references.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The functions simply return class references; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward plugin registration code with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports plugin decorators and classes, then defines three functions decorated with @hookimpl that return class references for version source, build hook, and metadata hook. There are no signs of malicious activity, data processing, or network communication. The code is minimal, correct, and standard for plugin registration. All signals indicate benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard plugin registration script with no malicious or security concerns. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
