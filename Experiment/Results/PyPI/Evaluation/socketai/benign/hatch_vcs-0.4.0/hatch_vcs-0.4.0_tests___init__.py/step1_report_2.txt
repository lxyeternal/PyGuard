  "purpose": "This code appears to contain only SPDX license identifiers for licensing purposes, likely indicating licensing information rather than functional code.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading detected.",
  "sinks": "No data output or sink points detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways identified, as the code only contains comments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of SPDX license comments is normal; no anomalies or suspicious code found.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of license metadata comments, which do not execute or perform any operations. There are no code instructions, data flows, or input/output mechanisms present. As a result, there are no security risks, no malicious behavior, and no obfuscated code. This is standard licensing information embedded in source files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign license metadata comments with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It is a standard practice to include such comments for licensing compliance.",
