  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign build hook for version management with proper validation and usage of external libraries. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior."
