  "purpose": "Manage VCS URLs and inject commit hashes into package metadata for versioning purposes.",
  "sources": "Configuration 'urls' dictionary, external utility 'vcs_utils.get_commit_hash(self.root)'",
  "sinks": "Formatted URLs stored in 'metadata['urls']'",
  "flows": "Configuration URLs -> formatter.format() with commit hash -> metadata['urls']",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward validation and formatting",
  "analysis": "The code validates 'urls' as a dict of strings, then uses 'ContextStringFormatter' with a lambda calling 'vcs_utils.get_commit_hash(self.root)' to inject commit hashes into URLs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. External utility usage appears standard and safe. The flow from configuration to formatted metadata is clear and secure. No suspicious data leaks or code injection points are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured plugin for injecting VCS metadata. It performs necessary validation, uses external utilities appropriately, and shows no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0.",
