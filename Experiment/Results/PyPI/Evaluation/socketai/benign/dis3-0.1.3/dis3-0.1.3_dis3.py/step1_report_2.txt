{
  "purpose": "The code provides tools for disassembling Python bytecode, analyzing code objects, and displaying detailed information about Python functions, classes, or code snippets.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from: sys.last_traceback, input source files, code objects, code strings, and traceback objects.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points include printing disassembled code to stdout or files, which could reveal internal bytecode or source code details if misused. No direct malicious sink like network communication or file damage is present.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as code objects or source code strings are compiled or read, then processed through disassembly functions, and results are printed or returned. No external or untrusted data flows into external systems or networks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated patterns detected. The code performs standard disassembly and introspection tasks. No unusual dynamic execution, malicious system calls, or privacy violations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis and disassembly of Python bytecode, using standard library functions and typical disassembly routines. It handles various input types securely, converts source code to code objects for inspection, and provides detailed code info. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, system modification, or covert data exfiltration are present. All operations are related to introspection and debugging, with no obfuscated or malicious logic. The functions operate within expected parameters for a disassembler and do not include any suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python bytecode disassembler and code inspector without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It primarily outputs debug and analysis information and does not contain any malicious payloads or backdoors.",
