  "purpose": "Disassembler for Python bytecode, used to analyze and display the structure of Python code objects, functions, classes, and source code.",
  "sources": "Input data can come from source code strings, code objects, functions, methods, classes, tracebacks, and raw bytecode.",
  "sinks": "The main output is printed disassembly and code info; no data sinks that lead to external data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input (source code, code objects, traceback) -> compilation or direct code object extraction -> disassembly functions -> printed output",
  "anomalies": "The code includes dynamic disassembly, code introspection, and uses of 'compile' for source strings, but no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are evident. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are used.",
  "analysis": "The code provides tools for disassembling Python bytecode and inspecting code objects, with functions to disassemble classes, functions, and raw bytecode. It uses standard Python modules like 'opcode' and 'collections', and includes methods for finding jump labels and line starts. No code patterns suggest malicious intent; the functions are standard for a disassembler utility. The only potentially risky aspect is the use of 'compile' on source code strings, which could be exploited if untrusted input is passed in, but in typical usage, this is part of normal disassembly workflows. There are no backdoors, external network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard Python bytecode disassembler with code introspection features. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. Its use of 'compile' on strings is expected for source disassembly, not suspicious. Overall, it appears safe and intended for debugging or educational purposes.",
