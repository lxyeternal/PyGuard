  "purpose": "Disassemble Python bytecode into human-readable mnemonics for analysis and debugging.",
  "sources": "Input can come from functions, classes, methods, code objects, raw bytecode, or source code strings.",
  "sinks": "Uses compile() to convert source code into code objects; prints disassembled instructions to specified files or stdout.",
  "flows": "Source (source code or code objects) -> compile or code object extraction -> bytecode analysis functions -> disassembly output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. No external network calls, file operations, or system modifications are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script provides comprehensive disassembly capabilities, allowing inspection of code objects, source code, and tracebacks. It relies on standard Python modules like sys, types, collections, io, and opcode. Functions such as dis(), distb(), and get_instructions() facilitate code analysis. The implementation appears standard and does not include any behavior that could be malicious or maliciously disguised. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or unusual data handling mechanisms are evident. The code's main function is for debugging or educational purposes, with no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate disassembler utility with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs standard Python bytecode analysis and output, with no suspicious activities or potential for supply chain attack identified.",
