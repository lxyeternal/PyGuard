  "purpose": "Disassembler for Python bytecode, intended for inspecting and analyzing code objects, functions, classes, and source code.",
  "sources": "Reads code objects, source code strings, tracebacks, functions, classes, and bytecode sequences.",
  "sinks": "Outputs disassembly and code info to stdout or files; no external data transmission or modification.",
  "flows": "Input (code objects/source strings) -> processing (compile, analyze) -> output (disassembly, info); no external leaks or malicious data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'compile()' on source code strings, which could be misused if untrusted input is passed, but this is standard for disassemblers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured Python disassembler module relying on typical modules and techniques. It does not perform any network activity, file modifications, or code execution beyond compiling source for disassembly. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The use of 'compile()' on source code is normal but could be a concern if used with untrusted input; however, this is inherent to such tools and not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Python disassembler with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The low risk score appropriately reflects the minimal potential misuse of 'compile()' in untrusted contexts. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in secure environments.",
