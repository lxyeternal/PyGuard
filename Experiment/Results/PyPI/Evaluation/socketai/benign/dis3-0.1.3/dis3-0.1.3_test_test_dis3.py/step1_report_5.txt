{
  "purpose": "The code provides minimal tests and utility functions for inspecting Python bytecode, disassembly, and code objects, primarily for debugging, testing, and analysis of Python bytecode and code structures.",
  "sources": "The code reads source code objects (__code__), functions, methods, and traceback objects. It also captures stdout and stdout streams via context managers.",
  "sinks": "The captured output streams (stdout/stderr) could potentially be manipulated but are intended for testing purposes only. No external data or untrusted input is processed or output to network/Files.",
  "flows": "Code captures and processes code objects and traceback frames, disassembles them, and redirects outputs for testing and inspection. There are no flows that send data over network, write to system files, or perform any external or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious behaviors are present. The code relies on standard Python modules and common testing patterns. No obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious data leakage mechanisms are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on testing and analyzing Python bytecode and code objects, providing utility functions for disassembly, instruction inspection, and code info display. It includes test cases that verify disassembly outputs, instruction properties, and code object metadata. No external network calls, file modifications, or malicious payloads are present. It uses standard library modules and well-known patterns for test harnesses. The code appears safe, well-structured, and solely intended for testing and debugging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a comprehensive test suite and utility set for inspecting Python bytecode and code objects, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It is designed solely for development and testing use cases, with no external data leakage, network activity, or system compromise mechanisms.",
