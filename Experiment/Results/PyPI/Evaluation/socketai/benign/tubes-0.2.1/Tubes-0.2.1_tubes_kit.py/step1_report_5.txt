{
  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions to manage pause/resume behavior and flow control for data streams (founts and drains).",
  "sources": "No explicit external data sources; internal method calls and object interactions.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external data output points present in the code.",
  "flows": "Method calls such as pause(), unpause(), flowingFrom(), flowTo() facilitate internal state changes; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected. The code implements straightforward pause/resume logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for managing pause and flow control mechanisms, using callable hooks for system-specific actions. No external inputs or outputs suggest malicious intent. The functions and classes follow standard design patterns for flow control, with no signs of obfuscated code or malicious behavior. The flow control functions manipulate object states internally without external data leaks or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of flow and pause management for data streams, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It is a well-structured, benign utility module.",
