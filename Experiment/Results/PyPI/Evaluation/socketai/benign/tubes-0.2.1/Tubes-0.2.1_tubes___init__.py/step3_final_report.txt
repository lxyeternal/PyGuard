  "purpose": "This code provides module documentation and licensing comments for the 'tubes' library, offering an abstraction of data flow and backpressure for event-driven applications.",
  "sources": "There are no data sources; the code contains only comments, licensing, and documentation strings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or handle any data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the snippet is purely descriptive with no executable logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains only comments and documentation, with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely comments, licensing notices, and a module docstring, with no executable code, data input/output, or data flow. All reports correctly identify this as benign documentation, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the content, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only documentation and licensing comments. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk present. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
