  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths are identifiable in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected; the code mainly consists of comments and licensing information.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet contains only comments, licensing, and documentation strings, with no executable code, data handling, or external input/output. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The lack of logic or data flow means no suspicious activity is detectable in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, consisting solely of comments and documentation. It does not include any executable code or data handling that could pose security risks or malicious behavior.",
