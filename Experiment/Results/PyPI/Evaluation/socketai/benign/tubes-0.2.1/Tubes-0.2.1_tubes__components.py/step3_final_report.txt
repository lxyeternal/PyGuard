  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing Zope interface adapter registries, including context management for activation/deactivation and registry construction.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines functions and imports modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; no sinks for data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; functions are utility constructs without external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The inert 'if 0:' block comments out an import, which is harmless and inert.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for registry management, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The 'if 0:' block is a benign placeholder. The functions use standard libraries and are straightforward. No external data, network activity, or secrets are involved. The scores in the reports (all zero malware and obfuscation, very low risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility module for managing Zope interface adapter registries. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk present. The existing scores are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting the code's harmless purpose.",
