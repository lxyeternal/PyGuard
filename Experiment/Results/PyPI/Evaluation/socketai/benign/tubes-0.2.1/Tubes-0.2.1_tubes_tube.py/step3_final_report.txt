  "purpose": "Utility decorators, classes, and functions for data pipelines and flow control within a stream processing framework.",
  "sources": "Function decorators, interface method implementations, imported modules; no external data inputs or network activity.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks or network transmissions; internal flow control only.",
  "flows": "Data flows through method calls like flowTo and flowingFrom, connecting flow components internally without external data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The 'divert' method allows rerouting but is a legitimate feature, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides infrastructure for managing data flow in a pipeline, utilizing decorators, interface implementations, and proxy patterns. It does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or contain malicious code. The 'divert' method's capability to reroute streams could be misused but is a standard feature of such frameworks. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The security posture is low risk, with scores reflecting potential misuse but no active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate infrastructure for data pipeline management, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the overall security risk is 0.2, indicating low risk but with potential for misuse if misconfigured.",
