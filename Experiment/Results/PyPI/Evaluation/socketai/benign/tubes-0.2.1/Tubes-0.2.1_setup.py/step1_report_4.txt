  "sinks": "No sinks present; setup() is a standard function call with no malicious or sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimalistic, but it contains only a single function call with no parameters or additional logic; no anomalies or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and calls the setup() function with default parameters. There are no arguments, no data processing, and no external input handling. This is a minimal setup script typically used to configure package distribution. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior. Its simplicity suggests standard usage, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard minimal setup script for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It merely invokes the setup() function with default settings, which by itself is benign.",
