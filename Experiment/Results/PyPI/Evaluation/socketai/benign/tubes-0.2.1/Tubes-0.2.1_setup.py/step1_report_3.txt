  "purpose": "To set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; uses standard setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs; minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setup function from setuptools and calls setup() with default parameters. There are no command-line arguments, no hardcoded secrets, no data manipulation, and no suspicious behavior. This is a standard boilerplate for Python package setup with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply invokes the setup process for packaging.",
