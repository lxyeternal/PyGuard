  "purpose": "This package provides documentation and module references for a Python GraphQL client library, with no executable code or data processing.",
  "sources": "Module-level docstrings, module references, license, and version information.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow; only static documentation.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, network calls, or suspicious patterns; purely descriptive comments and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of documentation strings and module references without any functions, data processing, or network interactions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The consistent reports correctly identify the code as benign documentation, with no security risks or malware. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and justified given the content. The confidence level is high (1), as the analysis is straightforward and thorough.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely documentation with no executable or malicious content. The security risk, malware, and obfuscation scores are all correctly set to zero. The package is safe, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
