  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as purely documentation and module references for a Python GraphQL client library.\n- They consistently state there are no executable code, data processing, network calls, or input/output operations.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, an obfuscated score of 0, and a security risk score of 0.\n- Confidence is perfect (1) across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The original code is a docstring or module-level documentation, with no executable logic.\n- No code, data flows, or network interactions are present.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Flaws or Logical Errors:\n- No errors or flaws are apparent in the reasoning; the reports correctly identify the code as non-executable documentation.\n- The consistent scoring aligns with the content described.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, as no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk score (0):** Correct, no vulnerabilities or security concerns are identified.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- Since the code is purely documentation, assigning any non-zero scores would be unreasonable.\n- The confidence level of 1 is appropriate given the thorough analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The content poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concern.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe provided code is strictly documentation with no executable or malicious content. All scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
