  "purpose": "Provides documentation for a GraphQL client package with modules for endpoint access, schema declaration, query generation, and type bindings.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; documentation comments only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified; the code is purely descriptive documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of docstrings and module metadata without executable logic, data handling, or network operations. There are no source or sink points, nor any suspicious patterns such as obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious commands. The content is standard documentation describing module usage and structure for a Python package. No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-executable documentation snippet describing a GraphQL client package. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The overall security risk is negligible, with a malware likelihood of zero and no security concerns.",
