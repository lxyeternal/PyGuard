  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Content:**\n   - All reports conclude that the code is purely documentation with no executable logic, data processing, network calls, or input/output handling.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n   - The content is standard for documentation and module references.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis, emphasizing the absence of executable code, data flows, or malicious activity.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is documentation-only, which inherently poses no security risk.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the content.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - Since the code is only documentation, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at zero.\n   - Any higher scores would be unjustified unless executable or malicious code is present.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the nature of the code as documentation.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is strictly documentation with no executable or malicious content.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at **0**.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified given the thorough analysis.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis. The package appears safe and free from security concerns.",
