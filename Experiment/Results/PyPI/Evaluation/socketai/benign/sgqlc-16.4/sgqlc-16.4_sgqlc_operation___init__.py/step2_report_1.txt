  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence provided and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is a GraphQL client and builder, handling query construction and response parsing. It emphasizes no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Data flows are from JSON responses into objects, and user input influences query structure.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, reasoning aligns with the analysis. The confidence is high (0.95). No suspicious patterns, no external network calls, no code execution, no data exfiltration mechanisms.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion that the code is safe and free of malicious intent is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to report 1, emphasizing the code's role as a GraphQL client library, with no malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. The detailed analysis confirms standard patterns, no external calls, and safe data handling.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, consistent with the reasoning. Confidence is high (0.95). No suspicious activity detected.\n\n- **Verdict:** The assessment appears accurate; the code is a legitimate GraphQL client utility.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the focus is on the code being a GraphQL query builder and response interpreter. It handles responses, errors, fragments, inline fragments, and variable substitution. No malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score remains 0, matching the detailed reasoning. Confidence is high (0.95).\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion that the code is legitimate and safe is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code constructs and interprets GraphQL operations, with extensive features like fragments, inline fragments, variables, and nested selections. The analysis confirms no malicious activity, no code injection, and standard practices for such libraries.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, consistent with the reasoning. Confidence is 0.95.\n\n- **Verdict:** The code appears secure and free of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a GraphQL client library for building and parsing operations, with dynamic attribute access, selection, fragments, and error handling. The analysis states no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or sabotage.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, matching the analysis. Confidence is 0.9.\n\n- **Verdict:** The code is consistent with a safe, standard GraphQL client library.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports consistently identify the code as a well-structured, feature-rich GraphQL client and query builder. They uniformly find no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The data flows are typical for such libraries, with no external network calls, code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms detected.\n\n**Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports give 0, and given the detailed reasoning, this is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports indicate 0, which is justified.\n- **Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, justified by the potential for misuse if untrusted data is mishandled, but overall the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the comprehensive review:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (low, inherent to data handling libraries, but no significant security concern)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, well-designed GraphQL client library, with no security risks or malware signatures detected.",
