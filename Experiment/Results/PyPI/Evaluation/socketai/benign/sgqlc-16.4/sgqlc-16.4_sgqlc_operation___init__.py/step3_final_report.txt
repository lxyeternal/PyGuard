{
  "purpose": "This code provides a comprehensive Python library for constructing, serializing, and interpreting GraphQL operations, including queries, mutations, fragments, inline fragments, and response parsing. It facilitates dynamic query building with features like selection sets, aliases, variables, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Attribute and item access on Selector and Selection objects, method calls for field selection, and JSON response data in the __add__ method.",
  "sinks": "String generation of GraphQL query strings (__to_graphql__), response parsing into object instances (__add__), and response data hydration.",
  "flows": "User code constructs queries via attribute/item access and method calls; queries are serialized to strings; responses (JSON) are added to the operation object, which interprets and maps data into typed objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of dynamic attribute/item access is standard for query builders; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured GraphQL client library that enables building complex queries, handling fragments, inline fragments, variables, and response interpretation. It employs dynamic attribute/item access for flexible query construction, and response data is mapped into typed objects via the __add__ method. No signs of code injection, network calls, or malicious payloads are present. The use of standard patterns and absence of obfuscation or hidden behaviors indicate a legitimate utility. The detailed reports correctly identify these aspects, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and low security risk (~0.1), which are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, feature-rich GraphQL client and query builder library, with no malicious, sabotage, or security risks detected. The detailed reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
