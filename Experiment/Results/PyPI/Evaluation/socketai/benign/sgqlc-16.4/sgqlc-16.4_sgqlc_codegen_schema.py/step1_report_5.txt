{
  "purpose": "This script generates Python code for GraphQL schemas using introspection data, creating sgqlc types and schema definitions.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON schema data from a file or stdin, potentially user-supplied or from an API response; also reads command-line arguments for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Writes generated Python code to a file or stdout; may execute code with the generated output (if used dynamically). No direct data leaks or system commands are executed.",
  "flows": "Input JSON schema -> parsing and analysis -> code generation functions -> writing Python code to output file/stream.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. Use of dynamic import paths for schema types could be unusual but is justified by schema generation purpose. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns found. No network activity or system modifications present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily processes JSON schema data, performs type analysis, and generates Python code. It uses static code patterns, standard library functions, and well-defined processing flows. No signs of malware such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No code injection, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors are present. The script relies on external JSON input, which is expected for schema generation, and writes output code accordingly. The import handling, argument parsing, and schema analysis are all straightforward. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate schema code generator without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard schema code generator for GraphQL schemas, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely processes input data and outputs Python code for sgqlc types, following normal patterns. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
