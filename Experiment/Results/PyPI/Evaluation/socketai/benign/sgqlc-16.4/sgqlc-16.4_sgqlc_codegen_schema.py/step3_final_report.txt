  "purpose": "A schema generator that reads GraphQL introspection JSON data and produces Python code defining schema types using sgqlc.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON schema data from input file or stdin.",
  "sinks": "Writes generated Python code to output file or stdout.",
  "flows": "Input JSON schema -> load_schema() -> CodeGen -> write() -> output file/stream.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static schema-to-code generator utilizing standard libraries and known packages. It performs JSON parsing, schema analysis, and code formatting without dynamic code execution or network operations. The code structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic. The schema data is processed into Python classes and types for sgqlc, with optional documentation inclusion. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident, and the logic aligns with typical schema processing tools.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, legitimate GraphQL schema code generator with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score (~0.1) appropriately reflects the minimal inherent risk in processing untrusted schema data, which is standard for such tools.",
