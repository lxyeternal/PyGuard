  "purpose": "Define custom scalar types for handling datetime objects and their string representations in GraphQL, including parsing, serialization, and conversion for datetime, date, and time.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings for datetime, date, and time; uses regex patterns for parsing; accepts pre-converted datetime objects; retrieves data through the converter methods.",
  "sinks": "The converter methods process input data, potentially from untrusted sources, to produce datetime objects; the __to_json_value__ methods serialize datetime objects back to strings for output.",
  "flows": "Input strings (sources) are matched and parsed via regex in converter methods, producing datetime objects; these objects are then serialized or used internally, but no external data is directly influenced outside the conversion process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features; code performs standard parsing and serialization of datetime data.",
  "analysis": "The code provides robust regex-based parsing for ISO 8601 datetime, date, and time formats, handling timezone info and compact forms. The converter functions validate and parse strings into datetime objects, raising ValueError on invalid input. The __to_json_value__ methods handle serialization back to string form. The code includes checks for pre-converted datetime objects, avoiding re-parsing. There are no suspicious network calls, file operations, or data exfiltration behaviors. The code strictly processes and serializes data, aligned with standard datetime handling, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for datetime scalar types in GraphQL, focusing on parsing, validation, and serialization. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It is safe with respect to supply chain security risks.",
