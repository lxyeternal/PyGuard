  "purpose": "Defines custom GraphQL scalar types for datetime handling, parsing ISO 8601 strings into Python datetime objects and serializing them back.",
  "sources": "Regex parsing of input strings, conversion functions, and class constructors that accept strings or pre-converted datetime objects.",
  "sinks": "No external calls, network interactions, or data leaks; primarily regex matching and object creation.",
  "flows": "Input strings are matched via regex, parsed into datetime objects, and stored; serialization functions convert datetime objects back into strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Regex patterns are straightforward and limited.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard custom scalar types for datetime data in GraphQL, with regex-based parsing for ISO 8601 formats, including timezone support. It handles pre-converted datetime objects and serializes them appropriately. No external calls, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns are present. The regex patterns are simple and unlikely to be exploited. The code is well-structured, and the logic aligns with typical datetime handling libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation for handling datetime data in GraphQL. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The minimal risk stems from regex parsing of untrusted input, which is standard practice and safe here.",
