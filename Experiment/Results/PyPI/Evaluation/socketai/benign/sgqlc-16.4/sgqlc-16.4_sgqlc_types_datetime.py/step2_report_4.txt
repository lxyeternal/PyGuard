  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code defines custom GraphQL scalar types for datetime, with regex parsing and serialization, handling ISO 8601 formats. It emphasizes that no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward implementation of parsing and serializing datetime data, using standard regex and datetime modules. No external system calls, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard parsing, serialization, and no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's behavior. The regex parsing is standard, and no suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2 (a slight concern, but justified given the regex parsing, which is standard and safe here).\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The reasoning is valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Highlights that the code uses regex parsing for ISO8601 formats, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code's approach is standard. Regex is used solely for validation and extraction, not for code injection or malicious purposes.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2, which seems appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion is justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the parsing and serialization logic, noting no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical implementation for GraphQL datetime scalars, with no suspicious elements.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.0, consistent with the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid reasoning.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing standard parsing and serialization with no malicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The code is safe, using standard libraries and regex for validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- **Presence of Issues:** No, the code is a standard, well-structured implementation of custom scalar types for datetime handling.\n- **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, which is correct given the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Security Risks:** Minimal; primarily related to regex parsing, which is standard and safe here.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to regex parsing, but very low)\n\n**In conclusion,** the supply chain security risk for this code is negligible. It appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation for handling datetime data in GraphQL, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Recommendations:** No changes needed. The code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
