  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'main' from the current package and executes it.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() function",
  "flows": "Import of 'main' -> execution of main()",
  "anomalies": "Lack of any additional code, no direct data input handling, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a module called 'main' from the current package and immediately calls its main() function. Without access to the 'main' module's content, no malicious or suspicious behavior can be determined at this level. The code structure is minimal and straightforward, typical of a package's entry point. There are no indicators of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard entry point that delegates to the 'main' module.",
