  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign and follows a common pattern for Python entry points. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the content of the 'main' module, which is unknown. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score is low, around 0.1 to 0.3, reflecting the uncertainty about 'main'. No immediate security issues are present in this snippet."
