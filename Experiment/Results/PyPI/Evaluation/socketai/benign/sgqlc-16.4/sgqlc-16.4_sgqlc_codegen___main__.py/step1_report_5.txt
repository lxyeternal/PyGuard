  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'main' from the current package and executes it by calling main().",
  "sources": "Import statement (from . import main), function call (main())",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() function (potentially executing untrusted code if 'main' is malicious)",
  "flows": "Import module 'main' -> call main()",
  "anomalies": "No visible anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'main' from the current package and immediately calls its main() function. This is a common pattern for executing the main logic of a package or script. Since there are no additional details about what 'main' does, it could contain any code, including malicious behavior, but nothing indicates suspicious activity in this snippet alone. The structure is simple and typical for entry point scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is minimal and does not contain any explicit malicious behavior. However, the security risk depends entirely on what the 'main' module's main() function executes. As it stands, the code is benign but warrants further inspection of the 'main' module for comprehensive security assessment.",
