{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'main' from the current package and executes it by calling main().",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local package; execution of main() function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() could potentially invoke untrusted or malicious code if 'main' is maliciously designed.",
  "flows": "Import of 'main' -> call to main() -> execution of code within main()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is minimal and straightforward, with no obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module 'main' and immediately executes its main() function. Since the content of 'main' is not provided, the security analysis is limited to the act of calling main(). If 'main' is malicious or compromised, executing it could pose a threat. No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are visible in this snippet. The code itself is simple and standard, but without the 'main' module content, the potential risk depends entirely on that module.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a minimal, standard import and execution pattern. Without information about the 'main' module, there is no clear malicious behavior. The overall risk depends on the content of 'main'.",
