{
  "purpose": "This script provides command-line utilities for generating GraphQL schema types and operations using the sgqlc library, based on user-supplied input files.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (command-line arguments), imports from local modules (.schema, .operation)",
  "sinks": "Argument parsing and command execution functions that invoke external code modules and print warnings/errors",
  "flows": "User inputs via command line (sys.argv) are parsed and used to determine which functions to execute, leading to schema or operation code generation",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious external network activity. The only noteworthy behavior is the automatic insertion of 'schema' as a default command if none is specified, with a warning message.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and local modules for schema and operation handling. It defines command-line argument parsing with subcommands for 'schema' and 'operation'. The 'main' function retrieves arguments, checks for subcommands, and defaults to 'schema' with a warning if none is provided. The code executes functions from imported modules based on user input. There are no indications of malicious payloads, external network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The warning about missing command-line arguments is for usability, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical command-line utility for code generation tasks, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. Its sole unusual aspect is the automatic insertion of a default subcommand with a warning, which is not inherently malicious but should be noted for clarity. Overall, the code appears benign and safe.",
