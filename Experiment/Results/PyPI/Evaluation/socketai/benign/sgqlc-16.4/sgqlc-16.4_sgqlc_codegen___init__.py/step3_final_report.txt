  "purpose": "A command-line utility for generating GraphQL schema and operation code using the sgqlc library, facilitating schema introspection and code generation workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, imports internal modules (.schema and .operation), and processes user commands.",
  "sinks": "Dispatches commands to handler functions; no untrusted data flows into system-critical operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "User input parsed via argparse → command dispatch to schema or operation handlers → execution of code generation functions.",
  "anomalies": "Automatic insertion of 'schema' as default command when no subcommand is provided, accompanied by a warning message; benign usability feature.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that uses argparse for subcommand handling, importing internal modules for core functionality. No network activity, code obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The default command insertion is a usability choice, not a security flaw. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign and transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured CLI tool for GraphQL code generation with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor default command behavior does not pose security risks. Overall, supply chain security risk is negligible.",
