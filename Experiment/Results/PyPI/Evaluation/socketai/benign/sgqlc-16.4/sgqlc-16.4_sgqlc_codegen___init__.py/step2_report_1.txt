  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No, the code appears benign.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.0. The low risk score is justified; the automatic default command is benign but noteworthy.\n- **Justification for Scores:** No malicious activity, just a usability feature.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no supply chain risk.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No, similar to Report 1.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.0.\n- **Justification:** The automatic default command with a warning is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.0.\n- **Justification:** Standard CLI behavior; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity; the default command insertion is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Justification:** Standard argument parsing; no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity. I agree with a malware score of **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores are appropriately **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** The only potential concern is the automatic insertion of 'schema' command when no command is provided, which could be considered a minor usability/security concern. However, it does not pose a real security risk. Given the scores in reports are around 0.1, I would keep this low, perhaps slightly higher if considering the automatic behavior, but still negligible.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports; could be slightly increased to 0.2 for the default command insertion, but I see no strong reason).\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard CLI utility for GraphQL code generation, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The automatic default command is a minor usability feature, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or 0.2 if you prefer to be slightly cautious about the default command insertion)\n\nThis analysis confirms the reports' conclusions and supports the code's safety in supply chain contexts.",
