{
  "purpose": "This code provides command-line utilities to generate GraphQL schema and operation code using the sgqlc library, facilitating automated code generation based on schema introspection and GraphQL documents.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include command-line arguments, environment variables (indirectly via sys.argv), and imported modules such as 'schema' and 'operation'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are sys.argv (via command-line parsing) and sys.stderr (for warnings), which are used to influence program flow and output.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are parsed and used to determine which functions to execute (schema or operation generation). The 'args' object directs control flow to the appropriate handler, with no untrusted data directly affecting sensitive operations beyond standard argument processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated features, or suspicious constructs are present. The code does not include any hidden network activity, dynamic code execution, or hardcoded secrets. It relies on standard libraries and external modules, with no signs of malicious manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines CLI utility functions for code generation tasks related to GraphQL schemas and operations, leveraging imported modules 'schema' and 'operation'. It handles argument parsing robustly, including a fallback mechanism to default to 'schema' command if unspecified. There is no dynamic execution of code, no network activity, and no credential handling. Warnings are sent to stderr; command processing depends solely on user input. The structure is typical for CLI tools, and no signs of malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard CLI utility for generating GraphQL code with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It performs argument parsing and dispatches to external modules responsibly, with no suspicious activity or security risks detected.",
