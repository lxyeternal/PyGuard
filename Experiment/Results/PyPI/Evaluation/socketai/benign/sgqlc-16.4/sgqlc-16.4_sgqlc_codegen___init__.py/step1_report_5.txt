{
  "purpose": "This script provides command-line utilities for generating GraphQL SGQLC code from schemas and operations, mainly serving as a CLI tool for code generation tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the current package (.schema, .operation), reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, and reads/writes to sys.stderr.",
  "sinks": "sys.argv (input), sys.stderr (output), and external modules for code generation, which are standard and not suspicious.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are parsed, and based on subcommands ('schema' or 'operation'), corresponding functions are invoked, with no untrusted data flowing into sensitive functions beyond argument parsing.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically inserts a default 'schema' command if the user omits the command, with a warning message. The warning message is written to sys.stderr, which is typical. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard CLI utility that handles command parsing for code generation tools related to GraphQL schema and operation generation. It uses argparse to parse arguments, with subcommands for schema and operation. It modifies raw_args to insert a default command if none is specified, with a warning. The functions invoked are imported from local modules, presumably safe. No external data sources, no network activity, and no suspicious logic are present. The dynamic insertion of a default command is benign, serving backward compatibility. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI utility for code generation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs argument parsing and delegates to local modules without untrusted data processing or external network activity. Overall, it appears safe.",
