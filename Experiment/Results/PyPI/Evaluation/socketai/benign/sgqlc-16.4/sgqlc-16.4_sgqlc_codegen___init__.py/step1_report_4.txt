{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool for generating GraphQL schema types and operations using sgqlc, based on user-provided schema JSON files and GraphQL query files.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (command-line arguments), imported modules (.schema and .operation)",
  "sinks": "sys.stderr.writelines (writes warning messages), sys.argv (used for command parsing)",
  "flows": "User input via command-line arguments influences which functions are called, and potential warning messages are written to standard error based on input analysis",
  "anomalies": "Automatic insertion of 'schema' command when unrecognized command is provided, with a warning message; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a CLI with subcommands 'schema' and 'operation', importing local modules for handling each. It parses arguments, automatically defaults to 'schema' if no command is specified, and warns users accordingly. No external network calls, file reads, or code execution based on untrusted data are present. The warning mechanism and argument parsing appear standard and benign. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard CLI utility for GraphQL code generation, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The only noteworthy behavior is the automatic default command insertion with a warning, which is not harmful. Overall, the code appears safe.",
