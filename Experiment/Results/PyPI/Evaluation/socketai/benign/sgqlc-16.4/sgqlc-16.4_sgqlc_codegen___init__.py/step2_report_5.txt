  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity detected; the code is a CLI utility for GraphQL code generation. The only notable behavior is the automatic insertion of 'schema' as a default command with a warning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low, benign warning).\n- **Assessment:** The logic is straightforward, benign, and consistent. The warning is user-friendly, not malicious.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with no malicious behavior. The automatic default command is noted but not suspicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; safe and benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—CLI for GraphQL code generation, no malicious activity, benign warning for missing command.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a standard CLI utility with the same benign default command insertion and warning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—standard CLI utility, no malicious behavior, benign warning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malware activity (score=0). The code does not perform any network operations, code injection, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Clear, well-structured code with no obfuscation detected (score=0).\n- **Risk Score:** The only minor concern is the automatic insertion of 'schema' when no command is provided, which is benign but could be considered a usability concern. The reports assign a very low risk (0.1) for this, which seems appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a straightforward CLI utility for GraphQL code generation, with no malicious intent or activity.\n- The automatic default command insertion is a usability feature, not a security risk.\n- No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The overall malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports' assessments)\n\n**Summary:** The supply chain risk from this code is negligible. It is a benign CLI utility with a minor, user-friendly feature that does not introduce security vulnerabilities.",
