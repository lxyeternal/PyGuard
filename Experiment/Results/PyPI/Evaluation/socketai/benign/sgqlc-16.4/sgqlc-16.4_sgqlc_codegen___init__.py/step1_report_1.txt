{
  "purpose": "This script generates GraphQL schema and operation code using the sgqlc library based on user-specified arguments.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments, imported modules (.schema and .operation), and system arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Arguments passed to functions such as handle_command in schema and operation modules, and sys.stderr.writelines for warnings.",
  "flows": "User command-line inputs are parsed, and depending on subcommands, the respective functions from imported modules are called, which may process files or generate code.",
  "anomalies": "Automatic insertion of 'schema' command when unrecognized input is provided; no other suspicious or malicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a command-line utility for generating GraphQL-related code. It imports standard modules and internal components, setting up argument parsing for 'schema' and 'operation' commands. It includes logic to default to the 'schema' command if no valid subcommand is provided, issuing a warning via sys.stderr. The main function parses arguments and dispatches to relevant handler functions. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or file manipulations that could indicate malicious activity. The code appears structured, with clear separation of concerns, and relies on external modules for core functionality. No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious code injection mechanisms are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate command-line utility for GraphQL code generation using sgqlc. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. Its potential security concern is the automatic insertion of 'schema' command when unrecognized input is detected, but this is a benign user interface convenience. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose supply chain risks.",
