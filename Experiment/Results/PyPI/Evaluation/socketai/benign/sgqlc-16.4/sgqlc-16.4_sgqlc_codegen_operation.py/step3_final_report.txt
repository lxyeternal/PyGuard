{
  "purpose": "A static code generator that reads GraphQL schemas and queries, performs optional validation, and outputs Python code for GraphQL operations using sgqlc. It does not execute untrusted code or perform network activities.",
  "sources": "Input files containing schema JSON and GraphQL queries, read via file streams; no untrusted input execution occurs.",
  "sinks": "Writes generated Python code as text to output files; no code execution or system modification.",
  "flows": "Input files are parsed and validated; then code strings are constructed via string formatting and written out; no dynamic code execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no eval/exec, no suspicious code patterns or backdoors. Uses standard libraries and external GraphQL parsing libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured GraphQL code generator. It reads schema and query files, optionally validates schema, and produces Python code via string templates. It does not evaluate or execute code from untrusted sources, nor does it contain obfuscation or malicious logic. The main potential security concern is that malicious input files could produce harmful code, but the generator itself remains safe. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The process is static and controlled, with no network activity or runtime code execution from untrusted sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard GraphQL-to-Python code generator with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The low risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects the inherent risk in code generation tools that rely on external input but does not indicate any security threat.",
