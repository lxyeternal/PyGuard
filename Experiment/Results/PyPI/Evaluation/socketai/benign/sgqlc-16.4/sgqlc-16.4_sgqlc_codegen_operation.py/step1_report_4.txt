{
  "purpose": "This script generates Python code for GraphQL operations based on schema and queries, facilitating code generation for GraphQL clients using sgqlc.",
  "sources": "Reads input GraphQL queries from files or stdin; loads schema JSON file if provided; reads command-line arguments for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Writes generated Python code to a file or stdout; dynamically constructs code strings for execution.",
  "flows": "Reads schema JSON -> Parses GraphQL source -> Validates schema and queries -> Generates Python code strings with embedded GraphQL operation definitions -> Writes output code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Use of dynamic code generation via string formatting could pose a risk if inputs are malicious but is controlled through file inputs. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution is present. No hidden network calls or system modifications are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily functions as a code generator that reads schema and query files, validates the data, and outputs Python code for GraphQL operations. It employs external libraries (sgqlc, graphql) for parsing and validation, which are standard. No use of eval, exec, or other dynamic execution methods is found. The file reading and writing operations are straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are evident. The logic ensures proper validation and safe code string construction. Overall, the script adheres to good security practices and does not contain malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate GraphQL code generation tool with no evidence of malicious behavior. Its operations depend on controlled file inputs and standard library usage. No malicious or sabotage mechanisms are present. It is safe for use in secure environments.",
