  "purpose": "Configuration setup for generating documentation using Sphinx for the 'sgqlc' project.",
  "sources": "import os, sys; sys.path.insert; variable assignments for extensions, paths, and themes.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling, external network connections, or sensitive data leaks.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows related to untrusted input or malicious payloads identified.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard Sphinx documentation configuration; no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up project metadata, extensions, static paths, themes, and output options for documentation generation. It imports standard libraries (os, sys) solely for configuration purposes. No data input, network activity, or sensitive information handling is present. No code execution or external calls beyond configuration are observed. The code is straightforward, and all components align with typical Sphinx config files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal configuration script for Sphinx documentation generation with no malicious or security concerns detected.",
