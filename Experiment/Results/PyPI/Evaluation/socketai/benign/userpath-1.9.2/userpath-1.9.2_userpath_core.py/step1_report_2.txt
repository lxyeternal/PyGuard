  "purpose": "Utility functions to manipulate and check system paths, likely related to environment or shell configuration management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as 'location', 'app_name', 'shells', 'all_shells', 'home', and 'check'.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'interface.put()' and 'interface.location_in_new_path()', which may modify system environment or shell configurations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to instantiate 'Interface', which then executes methods that likely alter environment variables or system paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs observed. The code is straightforward and relies on imported classes and functions. No suspicious network activity or data leakage evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple wrapper functions around the 'Interface' class methods, primarily managing system path modifications. It imports 'Interface' and 'in_current_path' from other modules. The functions accept parameters that influence how paths are prepended or appended, or checked for their presence in the current environment. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is apparent. The functions do not handle untrusted input directly in a way that indicates malicious intent; they appear to perform system configuration tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for managing system or shell paths without any malicious intent. It does not include malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The functions rely on external 'Interface' class, which should be reviewed separately for security, but based solely on this code, no malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected.",
