  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing system or environment paths via the Interface class.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of Interface objects and calls to their methods (put, location_in_new_path).",
  "sinks": "Methods of Interface that may modify system environment or paths; potential for system modifications if Interface is malicious.",
  "flows": "Functions instantiate Interface -> call methods with location and options -> potentially modify or check environment paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. The code is straightforward and delegates core logic to an external class.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple wrapper functions for path management, relying on an external Interface class. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The security implications depend on Interface's implementation, which is outside this snippet. The functions do not perform any malicious actions themselves. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of this code. Confidence is high (0.9) due to the straightforwardness. No adjustments are necessary unless Interface is malicious, which cannot be determined here.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as utility wrappers for path management. There are no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, contingent on the trustworthiness of the Interface class. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the provided code.",
