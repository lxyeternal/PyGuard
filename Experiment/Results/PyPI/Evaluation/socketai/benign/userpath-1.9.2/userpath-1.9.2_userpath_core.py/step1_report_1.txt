{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for modifying system paths or environment variables through an Interface class, such as prepending or appending locations, or checking if a location is in a new path.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: location, app_name, shells, all_shells, home, check",
  "sinks": "Method calls to Interface.put and Interface.location_in_new_path, which may modify environment or system paths",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Interface methods (put, location_in_new_path) -> system path modifications",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious file operations, or obfuscated code observed. No suspicious network activity or data leakage points detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines wrapper functions that instantiate an Interface object with optional parameters. These functions then call methods that potentially modify or check system paths. The functions are straightforward and rely on the Interface class for actual operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or network activity. The code appears to be part of a path management utility, with no indicators of sabotage or malware. The only concern could be if Interface methods perform malicious modifications, but this cannot be determined from this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a path management utility that delegates actions to an Interface class. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious activity in this snippet.",
