  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for path normalization, path inclusion checks, directory creation, command output retrieval, and parent process identification.",
  "sources": "os.environ, subprocess.Popen, os.getpid, os.getppid, psutil.Process",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen, subprocess.check_output, os.makedirs",
  "flows": "Input data from environment variables or system commands flows into subprocess calls and process info functions",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to run 'ps' command; no input validation or sanitization; reliance on environment variables and system commands",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of standard system utility functions that do not include any hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The subprocess calls are read-only and typical for system inspection. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are evident. The use of psutil and subprocess is appropriate and controlled. The potential security concern is the reliance on subprocess calls to system commands, which could be misused if the environment is compromised, but this is a common pattern in system utilities. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is justified as a conservative estimate of potential misuse in untrusted environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and appropriately scored. The assessments are consistent and justified; no changes are necessary.",
