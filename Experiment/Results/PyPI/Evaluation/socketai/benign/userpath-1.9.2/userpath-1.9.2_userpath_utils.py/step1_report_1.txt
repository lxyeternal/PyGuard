  "purpose": "Utility functions for path handling, command execution, and process information retrieval.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.environ.get), subprocess outputs, process ID (os.getpid), process parent ID (os.getppid).",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen (execute commands), subprocess.check_output, os.makedirs (directory creation).",
  "flows": "Environment variables → path functions; subprocess commands → output processing; process info functions → process name retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to run 'ps' command for process info; calling os.getppid and os.getpid; no explicit validation or sanitization of input parameters for subprocess calls.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for path normalization, path existence checking, directory creation, command output collection, and process info retrieval. It employs subprocess to execute system commands and retrieve process information, which could be manipulated if inputs are controlled maliciously, but in this context, the inputs appear to be internally controlled or predefined. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system damage, or stealthy backdoors are present. The subprocess commands are used in a read-only manner, with no evident attempts to exploit or misuse system features. The code structure does not contain obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. No suspicious data flows or code injection points are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for path and process info operations without malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior. The use of subprocess calls to 'ps' is typical for process introspection, and the overall design is consistent with legitimate utility functions.",
