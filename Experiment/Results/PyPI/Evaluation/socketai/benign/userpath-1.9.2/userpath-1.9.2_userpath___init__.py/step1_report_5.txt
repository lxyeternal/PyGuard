{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define the module's version and import specific functions from other modules within the package, likely for internal use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .core and .utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing operations are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports functions from local modules and sets a version string. There are no input/output operations, no network activity, and no suspicious code patterns. The version string is hardcoded but standard practice for package versioning. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security risks are apparent in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is benign, serving only to set the package version and import functions for internal use. No malicious behavior or security threats are identified.",
