{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization module, importing internal functions and setting a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.core and .utils), setting the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no external data or network interactions occur.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions and assigns a version string; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package setup snippet with only import statements and a version string. It does not process data, perform external calls, or contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of this code. There are no anomalies or signs of malicious intent. The internal modules are assumed benign, and the code's simplicity indicates a standard initialization pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
