{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports functions from local modules, defines a version string, and does not perform any other operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.core and .utils), and the assignment of __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no untrusted data outputs or external calls.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up imports and a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from sibling modules, sets a version string, and does not perform any further actions. It is a typical module initialization file with no embedded logic, external calls, or data processing. There are no signs of malicious activity or suspicious constructs. The code structure is straightforward and standard for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module setup with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected. It serves as part of a larger package and contains no active code or external interactions.",
