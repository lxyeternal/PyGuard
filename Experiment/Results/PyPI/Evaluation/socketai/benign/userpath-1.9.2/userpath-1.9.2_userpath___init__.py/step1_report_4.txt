{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific functions from internal submodules (.core and .utils) and sets a version identifier. It likely supports a larger package or application.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports functions and sets a version string.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only imports functions and assigns a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. Import statements and a version string are typical and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports functions from internal modules, which could contain sensitive or malicious code but cannot be determined from this snippet alone. The version string is standard. There are no dynamic code executions, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, benign module that imports internal functions and sets a version. No malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation are apparent in this code snippet.",
