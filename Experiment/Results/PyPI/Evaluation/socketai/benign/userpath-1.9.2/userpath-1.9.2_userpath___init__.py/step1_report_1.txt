{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package, importing functions from internal modules to define package behavior or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.core and .utils), which may contain further code reading or processing data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data, nor does it perform actions like network access or data storage.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable in this snippet; it only performs imports and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The __version__ attribute is a common practice for package versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from internal modules, likely for internal package use. The version string indicates package versioning. No data input, output, or side effects are evident. The code structure is straightforward and typical of a Python package's __init__.py file or similar setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package initialization code with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. It simply imports functions and sets a version number.",
