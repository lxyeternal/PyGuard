{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions from internal modules and defines a version string, likely for a package or module setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from its own module and the imported functions, as well as the version string.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause harm, such as network connections or file operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only references internal imports and a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and typical for a package's __init__.py or main module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from sibling modules and sets a version identifier. No data processing, user input handling, or external communications are present. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The structure appears typical for a Python package's internal initialization or configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a simple module setup with internal imports and version info. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
