  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data input.",
  "flows": "N/A; simple variable assignments without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version-related variables, including a version string and a version tuple. It contains conditional logic for type checking, but no dynamic or external data handling. The version string is hardcoded to '3.19.dev2', which is typical for development versions. No code injection, malicious behavior, or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version definition file generated by setuptools-scm. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
