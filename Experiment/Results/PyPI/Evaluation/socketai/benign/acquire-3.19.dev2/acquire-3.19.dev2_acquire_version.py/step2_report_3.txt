  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code.\n\n**1. Code Review of the Provided Source**\n\n- The code is a straightforward, auto-generated version file created by setuptools-scm.\n- It assigns static version strings and tuples.\n- It includes conditional type checking imports, which do not execute at runtime.\n- There are no external inputs, network calls, data processing, or dynamic behaviors.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code's purpose is solely to define version information for the package.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reports**\n\n- All five reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and generated by a known tool.\n- They correctly identify the absence of untrusted data sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors.\n- The reasoning in each report is consistent and accurate.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Scores**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, correctly reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk Score:** All assign 0, aligning with the benign assessment.\n\n**4. Logical and Reasoning Flaws**\n\n- No flaws are evident in the reasoning; the assessments are consistent with the code.\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the security posture.\n\n**5. Recommendations**\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- Since the code is purely static, generated, and has no malicious indicators, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**6. Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version declaration file with no malicious or suspicious content.\n- The reports' evaluations are correct and well-justified.\n- No changes to the scores are needed.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** All scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
