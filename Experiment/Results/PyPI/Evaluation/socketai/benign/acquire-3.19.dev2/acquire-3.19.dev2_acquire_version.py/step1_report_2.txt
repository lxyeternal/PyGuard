  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, and import statements under type checking condition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignment only.",
  "flows": "Direct assignment of version variables; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version-related variables, with version string and tuple set to static values ('3.19.dev2' and (3, 19, 'dev2')). It includes conditional imports for type checking, which do not execute at runtime. No user input, external data, or dangerous operations are present. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version definition module generated by setuptools-scm with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
