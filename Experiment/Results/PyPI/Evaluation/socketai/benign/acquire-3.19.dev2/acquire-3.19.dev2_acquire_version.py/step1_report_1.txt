{
  "purpose": "Define version information for the package using setuptools-scm generated data.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, and import statements within the TYPE_CHECKING block.",
  "captures": "No untrusted input sources; version data is hardcoded.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version-related variables, including __version__, version, __version_tuple__, and version_tuple. It conditionally imports typing constructs for type checking but does not perform any input/output, data processing, or network operations. The version data is hardcoded, and the code explicitly states it is generated by setuptools-scm, indicating it is part of a version management system. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version definition file generated by setuptools-scm. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is solely to hold version information for the package.",
