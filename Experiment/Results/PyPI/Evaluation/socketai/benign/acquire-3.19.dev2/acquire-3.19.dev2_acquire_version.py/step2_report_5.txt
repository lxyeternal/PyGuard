  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports:\n\n1. **Code Review of the Original Source:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward, auto-generated version info module.\n- It assigns static version strings and tuples.\n- It includes a conditional import for type checking, which is standard practice.\n- There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network operations, or dynamic behaviors.\n- The version data is hardcoded, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard, and contains no security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Review of the Reports:**\n\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a benign, auto-generated version management file.\n- They correctly identify that the code contains static assignments, conditional type checking imports, and no external data flow.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or signs of obfuscation are detected.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0 and security risks of 0, which are appropriate.\n\n**Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n\n- The reports seem thorough and consistent; they do not overstate or understate the security posture.\n- They correctly interpret the purpose and nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\nNo adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Critical Evaluation:**\n\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the code is simple.\n- The version string includes a development indicator ('dev2'), but this is standard for development versions and does not imply malicious intent.\n- The code's purpose is solely to hold version info, with no hidden or malicious logic.\n\n5. **Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is safe, with no security risks or malware.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores reflect the actual risk level appropriately.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a typical, auto-generated version info module with no malicious or security concerns. The reports correctly identify this, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
