{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm, setting version strings and tuples.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data flows.",
  "flows": "Direct assignments of static version strings and tuples; no dynamic or untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The version string includes a development indicator 'dev2', which is typical for development versions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version-related variables for a Python package. It sets __version__ and version to '3.19.dev2' and creates a version tuple (3, 19, 'dev2'). It also defines __version_tuple__ and version_tuple, with conditional typing based on TYPE_CHECKING. There are no data inputs, external calls, or dynamic behaviors that could be malicious. The code's structure is straightforward, with no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard version declaration code generated by setuptools-scm with no malicious or suspicious activity. It contains static assignment statements for version info, which are common and safe.",
