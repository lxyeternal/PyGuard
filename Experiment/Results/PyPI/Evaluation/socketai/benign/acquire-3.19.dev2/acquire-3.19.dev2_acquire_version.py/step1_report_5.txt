{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, and manages version string and tuple data.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' and version tuple '__version_tuple__' are assigned from hardcoded values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or external data processing present; no data leaks or untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "The hardcoded version string and tuple are assigned to variables, with no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a comment indicating it is auto-generated; no malicious or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version variables, with a conditional type checking block that does not execute at runtime. The version information is hardcoded and does not process or execute untrusted input. The structure is typical for auto-generated version management code and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, primarily managing package version information with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
