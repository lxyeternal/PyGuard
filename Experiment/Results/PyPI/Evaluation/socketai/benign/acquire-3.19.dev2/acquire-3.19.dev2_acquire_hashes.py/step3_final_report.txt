  "purpose": "Filesystem analysis utility for scanning directories, filtering files, computing hashes, and exporting metadata to CSV.",
  "sources": "Filesystem paths accessed via globbing, file opened for reading, hash functions applied to file data.",
  "sinks": "CSV writer for data export, hash functions for checksum calculation.",
  "flows": "Paths obtained from filesystem -> filtered by type and size -> hashes computed -> data serialized into CSV.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem traversal, filtering, hashing, and CSV serialization using well-known libraries. Exception handling is in place. No malicious or obfuscated code present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical utility functions. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured filesystem utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or high security risk. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
