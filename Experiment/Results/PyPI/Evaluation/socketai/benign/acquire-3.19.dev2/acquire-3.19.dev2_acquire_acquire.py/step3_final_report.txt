  "purpose": "A comprehensive, modular artifact collection framework supporting multiple operating systems, designed for forensic and security analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Filesystem glob patterns, registry keys, command outputs via subprocess, user input paths, environment variables, and configuration files.",
  "sinks": "File writes, registry access, command execution, glob-based file collection, network uploads, and log outputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system sources (files, registry, commands) into collection modules, then into files, logs, or network uploads.",
  "anomalies": "No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. Commands are static or system-derived, with controlled glob patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, modular artifact collection tool supporting Windows, Linux, macOS, ESXi, and other OSes. It uses subprocess calls with static commands, globbing, registry queries, and file reads, all typical for forensic tools. No malicious or sabotage signals are present. The subprocess commands are system-defined and do not process untrusted user input directly. No obfuscation or hidden backdoors are detected. The main risks involve potential input manipulation in subprocess or glob patterns, but these are controlled and predefined. Overall, the code demonstrates legitimate forensic purpose with minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured forensic artifact collection framework with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The slight risk score reflects standard concerns about subprocess and glob handling but does not indicate active threats.",
