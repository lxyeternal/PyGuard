      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard logging utility with support for delayed file handlers and dynamic reconfiguration. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and minimal risk score (~0.1) are justified. Overall, the code is safe for use, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues."
