  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies or suspicious code patterns are visible; lack of code makes detailed analysis impossible.",
  "analysis": "The analysis is limited due to the absence of provided code. Generally, review would involve checking for hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, obfuscated code, or unusual data flows. No such patterns can be confirmed without actual code snippets.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code content, no malicious behavior can be detected. The code appears benign or is not provided for detailed review.",
