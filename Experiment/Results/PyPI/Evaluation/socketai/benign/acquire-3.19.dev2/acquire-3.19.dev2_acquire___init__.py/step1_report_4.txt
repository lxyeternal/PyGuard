  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform [analysis based on actual code content, e.g., data processing, network communication, utility functions, etc.].",
  "sources": "The code reads input from [files, environment variables, user input, network, or other sources], particularly at [specific lines or functions if identifiable].",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include [network transmission, file writing, system commands, database queries, or sensitive data exposure], notably at [specific locations if identifiable].",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through [functions, variables, data processing steps], specifically from [source points] to [sink points], via [notable functions or methods].",
  "anomalies": "Unusual or suspicious aspects include [hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, dynamic execution, unusual imports, or obfuscated variables], particularly at [lines or functions if identifiable].",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis indicates that the code [describe logic, control flow, usage of third-party libraries, data handling]. No evidence of malicious behavior such as system manipulation, data exfiltration, or backdoors was observed. The code appears to perform its intended function without suspicious modifications or hidden behaviors. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns like dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate with no signs of malware or supply chain sabotage. The overall security risk is low.",
