  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic eval calls, environment variables, network functions, suspicious imports, hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or eval inputs flow into network functions, system commands, or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation suspicion (e.g., dynamic eval, suspicious imports), but no confirmed malicious activity; no overt malicious functions identified.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits some obfuscation techniques and dynamic execution patterns, which are suspicious but not definitive of malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads are explicitly observed. The potential for data exfiltration or command execution exists, but without concrete malicious commands or behaviors. The scores assigned reflect cautious suspicion, with malware at 0.2, obfuscation at 0.2, and moderate security risk at 0.3, aligning with the described features. Confidence levels are moderate, given the lack of actual code snippets, and no false positives are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows some obfuscation and dynamic features that warrant cautious scoring but no confirmed malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating low malware likelihood but some potential risk due to obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns.",
