  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured deployment utility for Juju with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary concern is external URL trustworthiness, which is outside static analysis scope. Scores are consistent with the absence of malicious behavior, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low security risk score of 0.2 reflecting typical network dependencies."
