  "purpose": "Definition of a custom exception class named DeadEntityException",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as no data processing is involved",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be a straightforward exception class definition with no unusual or suspicious elements",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. There are no external data sources, no input handling, and no suspicious or malicious operations. The class is minimal and serves as a specific exception type, which is common in Python projects. The licensing comment indicates compliance and does not raise security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class definition with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and is typical in Python applications for custom error handling.",
