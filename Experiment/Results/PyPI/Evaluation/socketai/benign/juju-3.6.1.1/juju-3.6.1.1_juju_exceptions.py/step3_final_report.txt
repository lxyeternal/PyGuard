  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class 'DeadEntityException' inheriting from Python's built-in Exception.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow occurs as the code only declares a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward class definition with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class declaration for a custom exception, with no input/output, data handling, or external interactions. It contains only licensing comments and a class inheriting from Exception. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. The simplicity and clarity of the code indicate it is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python exception class with no security concerns or malicious intent. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and do not require modification.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
