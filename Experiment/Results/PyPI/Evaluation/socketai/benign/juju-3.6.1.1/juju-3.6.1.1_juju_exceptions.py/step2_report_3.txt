  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the validity of their assessments, scores, and conclusions.\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal, straightforward class definition for a custom exception (`DeadEntityException`).\n   - There are no input/output, data processing, or external interactions in the code.\n   - The code does not contain any malicious logic, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Error, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flows, sources, sinks, anomalies, or malicious intent.\n   - No mistakes or logical flaws are apparent in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores assigned are:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (correct, no obfuscation)\n     - `malware`: 0 (correct, no malware)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (correct, no security risk)\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - The reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - No reason exists to increase this score, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious elements.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - Since the code only defines a custom exception class with no malicious behavior, the malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they simply analyze the code as is.\n   - They do not speculate about potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent beyond what is present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward, standard Python class defining a custom exception. There are no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the existing evaluations and the actual code content.",
