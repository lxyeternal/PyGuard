  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception (`DeadEntityException`) inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - There are no data sources, sinks, or flows involved, as the code is purely declarative.\n\n2. **Potential for Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code contains no executable logic beyond defining a class.\n   - No input/output operations, external data handling, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The licensing comment is standard and does not introduce any security concerns.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The reports are consistent in noting the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No errors or flaws are identified or implied.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly assume that defining an exception class is harmless.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made without basis.\n\n6. **Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n   - No modifications needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, benign class definition with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and comprehensive. No changes to the scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the existing reports and the actual code content.",
