  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception, with no data input/output, external interactions, or complex logic. The code is minimal and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly note that there are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious elements. No errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Obfuscated score (0)**: Correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n   - **Malware score (0)**: Correct, no malicious activity is suggested or implied.  \n   - **Security risk score (0)**: Correct, the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since the code is purely a class definition with no external data handling, no malicious code, and no suspicious patterns, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they only describe the code as-is, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — The code is benign.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks are present.\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nThe code is a minimal, standard Python class for a custom exception, with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports correctly identify this. Therefore, I agree with the current scores, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis code is safe, benign, and typical in Python projects for custom error handling.",
