  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code interacts with external APIs via `requests.get()` within async functions.\n- No report detects any malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- The main concerns are related to the use of synchronous network requests (`requests.get()`) in async functions, which could impact performance but not security.\n- None mention hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious data handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code uses `requests.get()` in async functions without validation or sanitization, which is correctly identified as a potential concern but not malicious.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors:**  \n  No logical errors or malicious code are evident. The code is a standard API client.\n\n- **Scoring concerns:**  \n  All reports assign malware score = 0 and security risk around 0.2, which seems appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n\n### Justifications for scores:\n- **Malware score (0):**  \n  No malicious activity, payload, or backdoors detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score (0):**  \n  No obfuscation or suspicious code structures.\n\n- **Risk score (~0.2):**  \n  This accounts for the network interactions with untrusted external sources, which is a standard concern but not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- Use of `requests.get()` inside async functions is unconventional; an async HTTP library (like `aiohttp`) would be more appropriate. However, this is a performance concern, not a security one.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (due to network interactions, but no malicious intent)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a straightforward API client with no signs of malicious activity. The main concern is the synchronous network calls in async functions, which could be optimized but do not pose security risks.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Confidence:** High, given the consistent analysis across reports.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No evidence of supply chain compromise, malicious payloads, or obfuscation. The code is low risk from a security perspective.",
