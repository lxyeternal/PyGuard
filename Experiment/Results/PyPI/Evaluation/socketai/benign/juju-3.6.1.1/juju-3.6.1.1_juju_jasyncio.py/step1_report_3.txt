{
  "purpose": "This code provides a compatibility layer for asyncio functions across different Python versions, facilitating the use of asyncio primitives and helpers in an environment-agnostic way.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the environment (via signal handling), and imports functions and classes from asyncio and juju._jasyncio modules.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the 'run' function, which executes asynchronous functions and handles signals; no data is explicitly sent or leaked outside standard process control.",
  "flows": "Input from the environment (signals) influences the execution flow within 'run', which executes provided async steps using the event loop, handling exceptions and signals.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses standard asyncio mechanisms and proper signal handling with exception management.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a compatibility layer with asyncio, importing various functions for asynchronous operations. It defines a 'run' helper that executes async functions synchronously with signal handling, particularly SIGINT. It utilizes a singleton event loop, handles potential exceptions when adding signal handlers, and ensures clean removal of handlers. No malicious behaviors like network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The deprecation warning is standard and does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is a typical utility module with no suspicious or malicious content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard asyncio compatibility and helper module, implementing safe and conventional patterns for running async code with signal handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
