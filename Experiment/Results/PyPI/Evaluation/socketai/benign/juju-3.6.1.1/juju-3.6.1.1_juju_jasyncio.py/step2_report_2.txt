  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Compatibility layer for asyncio, standard library imports, no external or suspicious sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Manages asyncio tasks, handles SIGINT signals gracefully, no data leaks or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; code is straightforward, standard for asyncio management.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, utility code with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.5 (slightly elevated due to signal handling but justified), confidence=1.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar purpose, with emphasis on task management and signal handling.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), securityRisk=0.2, still no malicious signs.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (appropriate given the context), confidence=0.9.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on compatibility, standard imports, and a run() helper.\n- No signs of malicious activity; deprecation warning is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar utility purpose, standard modules, deprecation warning noted.\n- No malicious signs, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Utility layer, manages asyncio tasks, signals; no external or malicious data handling.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity. The code is a straightforward asyncio utility with signal handling, nothing malicious.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** While some reports assign a slightly elevated securityRisk (up to 0.5 or 0.2), these are justified by the signal handling and task management functions, which could be misused if misconfigured, but are standard in such utilities.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** Given the code's purpose and context, a risk score of **0.1** to **0.2** is appropriate. The slightly higher value in some reports (0.5) seems excessive, as the code does not perform any insecure operations.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** **0** (benign)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (not obfuscated)\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1** (minimal, due to signal handling, but standard practice)\n\nThis code appears to be a benign utility module for asyncio compatibility and task execution with signal handling, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
