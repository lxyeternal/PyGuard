  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1**:\n- Purpose: Compatibility layer for asyncio, providing helper functions.\n- Behavior: Runs async functions synchronously, handles SIGINT signals.\n- Findings: No suspicious code, no malicious patterns, standard signal handling.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Risk Score: 0 (just utility code)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment**: The report's conclusion aligns with the code; no malicious activity detected. The use of signal handling and task management is standard for such utilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**:\n- Purpose: Compatibility layer, managing signals and async primitives.\n- Behavior: Executes async functions with signal handling, cancels tasks on SIGINT.\n- Findings: No hardcoded secrets, suspicious functions, or backdoors.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Risk Score: 0.2 (slightly elevated due to signal handling, but standard practice)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment**: The code's behavior is typical for asyncio utility modules. The slight risk score accounts for signal handling, which, if misused, could affect system behavior, but in this context, it’s benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**:\n- Purpose: Compatibility layer for asyncio functions, with a helper to run async code synchronously.\n- Behavior: Uses singleton event loop, manages signals, executes async functions.\n- Findings: No malicious code, no secrets, no suspicious patterns.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Risk Score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment**: The code is a standard utility module with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**:\n- Purpose: Compatibility layer, managing asyncio primitives and signals.\n- Behavior: Executes async functions, handles SIGINT, manages event loop.\n- Findings: No malicious behavior, uses deprecated modules but not malicious.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Risk Score: 0.1 (low, standard utility code)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment**: The code is benign, with the only concern being the use of deprecated modules, which is not a security issue.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**:\n- Purpose: Compatibility layer, running async functions with signal handling.\n- Behavior: Manages tasks, signals, no external data or network activity.\n- Findings: No secrets, no suspicious patterns, standard practices.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Risk Score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment**: Clear, standard utility code with no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate. The code is a straightforward asyncio utility layer, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports agree on 0; the code is transparent and readable.\n- **Risk Score**: Mostly 0 or very low (0.1-0.2). The signal handling and task cancellation are standard practices. The only minor concern is the use of deprecated modules, which does not pose a security risk.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware**: 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk**: 0.1 — minimal, related to signal handling and deprecated modules, but not a security threat.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, standard asyncio compatibility and utility module. It manages asynchronous task execution and signal handling in a typical manner. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The low risk score reflects the minimal potential for misuse, which is inherent to signal handling utilities but not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n**Recommendation**: No further action needed; the code appears safe and appropriate for its intended utility purpose.",
