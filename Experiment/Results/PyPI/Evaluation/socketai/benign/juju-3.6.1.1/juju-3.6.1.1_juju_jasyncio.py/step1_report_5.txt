{
  "purpose": "This code provides a compatibility layer for asyncio functions across different Python versions and a helper function to run async functions synchronously with SIGINT handling.",
  "sources": "import statements for standard modules (logging, signal, warnings, asyncio), and custom imports from juju._jasyncio",
  "sinks": "The run() function executes provided async steps, managing tasks and signals; no untrusted data handling or network I/O observed.",
  "flows": "The run() function creates asyncio tasks from input functions, runs them, and handles signals, propagating exceptions if any occur.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of deprecated juju._jasyncio module is noted but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly acts as a compatibility layer and a synchronous runner for asyncio functions, managing signal handling and task execution. No external data input, no network connections, or suspicious code constructs are present. The use of a deprecated module indicates potential maintenance issues but not malicious intent. The code's structure and imports are standard, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module facilitating asyncio compatibility and task execution. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
