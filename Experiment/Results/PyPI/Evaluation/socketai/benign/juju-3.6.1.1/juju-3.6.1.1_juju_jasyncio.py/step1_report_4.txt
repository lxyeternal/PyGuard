{
  "purpose": "The code provides a compatibility layer for asyncio functions across different Python versions and includes a helper to run async functions synchronously with signal handling.",
  "sources": "Reads import modules (logging, signal, warnings, asyncio, juju._jasyncio), uses signal handling and asyncio event loop methods.",
  "sinks": "Uses signal handling to manage SIGINT, cancels tasks, and runs event loops; no data sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Imports modules and functions -> sets up signal handlers -> runs provided async functions -> cancels tasks on SIGINT.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated juju._jasyncio module, but only as a wrapper, no malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The run() function manages signal handling and task execution securely. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules for asyncio and signal handling, re-exports asyncio primitives, and issues a deprecation warning about the juju._jasyncio module. The run() function manages the execution of async functions synchronously, with proper signal handling for SIGINT, and manages event loop lifecycle. All imported modules and functions are standard or well-known third-party, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The only noteworthy point is the deprecation warning, which does not impact security but indicates future changes. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard asyncio compatibility and execution helper with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attack. It handles signals and runs async functions safely. The only concern is reliance on deprecated modules, which does not affect security.",
