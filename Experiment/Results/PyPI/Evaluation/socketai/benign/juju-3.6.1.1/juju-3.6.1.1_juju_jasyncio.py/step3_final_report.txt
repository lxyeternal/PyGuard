{
  "purpose": "Provides a compatibility layer for asyncio functions and a helper to run async functions synchronously with signal handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from asyncio (e.g., create_subprocess_exec, ensure_future, gather), signal handling in run() function, singleton event loop.",
  "sinks": "Execution of async functions, handling SIGINT signals, task creation and cancellation.",
  "flows": "Source: async functions and signal handlers -> Sink: task execution and cancellation, signal handling in run().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; use of deprecated juju._jasyncio module noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility layer for asyncio, importing standard functions, managing signals, and providing a run() helper. It handles SIGINT gracefully, cancels tasks if interrupted, and uses a singleton event loop. No external data, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The deprecation warning is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is transparent, readable, and employs common practices for asyncio utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard asyncio compatibility and utility module with no malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The low risk score reflects the minimal potential for misuse inherent in signal handling utilities but does not indicate malicious intent.",
