  "flows": "Input (controller name) from get_controller method -> connect() method in Controller object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of async/await is appropriate for network operations. No unusual or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Juju client classes and defines a Juju class with methods to retrieve controllers and connect to a specific controller asynchronously. It uses input parameters for selecting controllers and optionally including passwords. The connection method is called via an await, which is standard for async network connections. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to perform legitimate operations for managing Juju controllers. No signs of malicious or sabotage activities were detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, performing standard Juju controller management tasks. No malicious or maliciously suspicious activity is evident.",
