  "purpose": "Manage Juju controllers by listing available controllers and establishing asynchronous connections to a specified controller.",
  "sources": "jujubata.controllers() for controller data, parameters in get_controller() for controller name and include_passwords flag",
  "sinks": "controller.connect(name) for establishing network connection to the controller",
  "flows": "From jujudata.controllers() to validation check, then to Controller().connect(name) during get_controller()",
  "anomalies": "Use of assert for type checking; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns; straightforward data validation and connection logic",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for managing Juju controllers, involving data retrieval, validation, and network connection. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The validation steps are appropriate, and the code relies on trusted external libraries. The use of assertions could be a minor point but does not impact security. Overall, the code is benign, with low security risk and no signs of malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, legitimate, and free from malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1-0.2) are accurate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
