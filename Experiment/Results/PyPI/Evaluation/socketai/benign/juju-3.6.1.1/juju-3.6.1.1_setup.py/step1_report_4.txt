  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'juju', including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the script itself, reading README and changelog files for long description.",
  "sinks": "Installation dependencies, package data, and metadata; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reading files for long description -> setup() parameters; no untrusted data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines package metadata and dependencies using standard setuptools functions. It reads documentation files to build a long description. The dependencies listed are standard and do not include any suspicious packages or code. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The code follows typical packaging patterns without any anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
