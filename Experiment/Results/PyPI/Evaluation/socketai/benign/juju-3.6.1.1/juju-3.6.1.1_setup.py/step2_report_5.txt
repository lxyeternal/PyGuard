  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code reads static documentation files and version info, with dependencies explicitly declared.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present.\n- The code structure is typical for a setup.py script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present in the provided script.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None are identified; the script follows standard practices.\n- **Scores given:** All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated code:** All reports note no obfuscation.\n- **Flow and data handling:** All data flows are static and controlled, with no external untrusted input or network operations.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is correct; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified; the script performs only package setup tasks with no security concerns.\n\n### Any inconsistencies or concerns?\n- The dependency on external files (`readme.rst`, `changelog.rst`) is standard; no risk there.\n- The import of version info from `juju.version` is safe assuming the package is maintained properly.\n- The only minor note is the dependency `\"pytest-asyncio <= 0.25.0\"` which has a space before `<=`, but this is a formatting issue in the list, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk detected)\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis setup script is a typical, benign package configuration file with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the analysis confirms that the code is safe.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scores. No further action required.",
