{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging the 'juju' Python library, reading static documentation files and defining dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'readme.rst', 'changelog.rst', and importing version info from 'juju.version'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Static reading of documentation files and version info, with dependencies declared explicitly; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static 'setup.py' script for packaging. It reads documentation files and version info, declares dependencies with explicit constraints, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or handling of untrusted input. All operations are standard and controlled. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code structure and dependencies are typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
