{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'juju' Python package, used for package configuration and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading package files such as 'readme.rst' and 'changelog.rst', importing version info from 'juju.version', and defining dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No untrusted data processing or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Reading static files -> setting up package metadata -> defining dependencies and package info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; standard setup procedures. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script is a conventional setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It reads documentation files, constructs long descriptions, specifies dependencies, and sets package metadata. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code paths. The only notable aspect is the reliance on external files for documentation and version info, which is standard practice. No obfuscated code, no code injection, and no network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
