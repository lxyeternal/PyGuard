{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package for the Juju library, defining dependencies, package data, and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package files (README and changelog) for long description, imports from 'juju.version' for version info, and dependencies listed in 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no code that writes, executes, or transmits data outside typical package setup context.",
  "flows": "Reads static files -> constructs package metadata -> passes data to setuptools.setup() for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Uses standard packaging and dependency management practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package. It reads static files for documentation, imports version info, and calls setuptools.setup() with package details and dependencies. No user input, no dynamic code execution, and no network communication or sensitive data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard package setup functions without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a typical, well-structured setup file for the 'juju' Python library.",
