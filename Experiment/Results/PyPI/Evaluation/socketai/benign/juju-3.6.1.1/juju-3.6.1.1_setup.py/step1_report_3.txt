  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package named 'juju' with its metadata, dependencies, and configurations for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the package version from juju.version.CLIENT_VERSION, reads the README and changelog files for long description.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No untrusted data handling or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Reads version and documentation files, then passes data to setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python project. It imports necessary modules, reads version info and documentation files, and calls setup() with metadata and dependencies. The dependencies are specified with version constraints and are typical for a Python project. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious activity, suspicious code, or security risks are identified.",
