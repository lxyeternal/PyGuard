  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling duplicate child errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code only declares a class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or security-sensitive sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class declaration with a docstring.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a custom exception class named DuplicateChildError inheriting from Exception, with a docstring explaining its purpose. It contains no logic, input/output, or data handling. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The class can be used for control flow or error handling within a larger application but is benign by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign custom exception class with no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard part of application error handling.",
