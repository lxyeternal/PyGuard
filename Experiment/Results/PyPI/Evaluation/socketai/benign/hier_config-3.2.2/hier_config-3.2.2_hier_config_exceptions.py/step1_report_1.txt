  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling duplicate child addition errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data read operations present.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs, network operations, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class inheriting from Exception with a docstring explaining its intended use. It contains no external input, no data processing, no network or system interactions, and no obfuscated or suspicious code segments. The simplicity indicates a standard, benign implementation intended for error handling within a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign class definition for an exception related to duplicate child errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
