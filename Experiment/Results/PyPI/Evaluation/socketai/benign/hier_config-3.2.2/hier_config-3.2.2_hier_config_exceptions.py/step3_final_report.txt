  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class 'DuplicateChildError' for handling duplicate child addition errors.",
  "sources": "No external input, data reading, or data flow; only class definition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external interactions; purely a class declaration.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code; simple class with docstring.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python class inheriting from Exception with a descriptive docstring. It contains no logic, input/output, or external dependencies. All reviews correctly identify it as benign, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or security concerns are present. The code's simplicity and purpose as a custom exception class justify the absence of any security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python exception class with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
