  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling duplicate child addition errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, external data outputs, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code solely defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This code snippet only defines an exception class named 'DuplicateChildError' with a docstring. It does not include any code that reads external input, accesses environment variables, or performs operations that could be exploited. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The class is a straightforward subclass of Exception, intended for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard definition of a custom exception class without any malicious or security-related issues. It poses no security risks or malware concerns.",
