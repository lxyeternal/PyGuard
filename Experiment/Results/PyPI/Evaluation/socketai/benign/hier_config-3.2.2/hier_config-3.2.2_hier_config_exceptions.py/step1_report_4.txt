  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for handling duplicate child addition errors.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; code defines an exception class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class definition is isolated and simple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code presents a simple custom exception class in Python, inheriting from Exception. It contains only a docstring explaining its purpose and no other logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The class appears to be a standard, harmless construct used for exception handling within a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines a basic custom exception class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign, standard pattern in Python programming.",
