  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing classes and functions from sibling modules and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data sources; it only imports from local modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network communication, file writing, or external data leaks present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines imports and exports symbols without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup, importing classes and functions from sibling modules and defining __all__ for public API exposure. It performs no dynamic execution, data handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior justify these assessments. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present, and the code adheres to standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. No further action is necessary.",
