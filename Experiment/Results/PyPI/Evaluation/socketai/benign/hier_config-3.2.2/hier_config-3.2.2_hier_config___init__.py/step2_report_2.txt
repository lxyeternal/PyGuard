  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward __init__.py or module file that imports and exposes classes/functions.\n- They consistently find no anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or security issues.\n- The code only performs static imports and defines __all__, with no data processing, external input handling, or network activity.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, and malware scores are 0 across reports, indicating consensus.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does **not** contain any embedded malicious code, dynamic execution, or obfuscated patterns.\n- There are no signs of malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data flows.\n- The structure is standard for Python package modules.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n- Since all reports agree and the code is simple, there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No report suggests any assumptions that could be challenged; all are consistent.\n\n**Summary of Recommendations:**\n- The code is benign and standard.\n- The scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n- The high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores are justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a typical module initializer with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
