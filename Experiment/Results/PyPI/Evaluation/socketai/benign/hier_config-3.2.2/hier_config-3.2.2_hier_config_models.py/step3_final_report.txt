{
  "purpose": "The code defines data models, enums, and configuration schemas for a system managing network device configurations and rules, using pydantic for data validation and type safety.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from class instantiations and type annotations within the model definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data flows into potentially dangerous operations; the code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs into model instances, but since no dynamic processing or external data handling is present, no malicious flow exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. Use of 'auto()' in enums and frozen configurations are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static data model definitions using pydantic and enums, with no executable logic, external data handling, or dynamic code. It employs safe configurations and standard enum patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident. The code appears to serve as schema definitions or configuration models within a larger system, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and secure. It functions as a static schema layer without any malicious or security concerns. All signals indicate a safe, declarative design with no obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
