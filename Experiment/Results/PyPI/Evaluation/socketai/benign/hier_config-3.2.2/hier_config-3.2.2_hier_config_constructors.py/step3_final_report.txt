  "purpose": "Configuration parser for network devices supporting multiple platforms, handling configuration text, banners, and hierarchical structures.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from files or strings, applies regex substitutions, processes banners, and constructs hierarchical configuration objects.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network transmission or system modifications; primarily processes text inputs and updates internal data structures.",
  "flows": "Configuration input → regex substitutions and banner handling → hierarchy analysis and object creation → final configuration object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic detected. Regex substitution rules could be misused if malicious rules are supplied externally, but none are embedded.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard configuration parser that reads configuration data, applies regex-based transformations, manages hierarchical structures based on indentation, and handles banners. No network activity, code injection, or malicious payloads are present. The regex substitution and banner handling are typical for such parsers and do not indicate malicious intent. The absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns supports a benign assessment. The potential risk lies in the external regex rules being malicious if supplied, but the code itself does not contain or enforce such rules. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate configuration parser for network devices with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal risk score (~0.1) are justified. It is safe to use in trusted environments; caution should be exercised if regex rules are externally supplied and unvalidated.",
