{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'podman-compose' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, importing os and setuptools modules, and defining setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function and entry points may execute or load external code, but in this context, they are standard for package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md (source) → setup() parameters including entry points (sink) which register console scripts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code is straightforward package setup with no unusual patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads a README file with a try-except block to avoid failure if the file is missing. It then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. All code appears standard for Python package setup. No network calls, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is procedural, clear, and conforms to common practices for packaging Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for a package named 'podman-compose'. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The overall security risk is negligible, and there is no indication of malware or malicious intent.",
