  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, considering the code, the analysis, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Python setup script.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The only dynamic operation is reading the README.md file, which is handled safely.\n- Entry points are standard for CLI tools, invoking a function in the package module.\n- No network activity, untrusted data processing, or code injection is present.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review per report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues found.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues found.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues found.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues found.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The \"malware\" score is appropriately zero; there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score is zero; the code is straightforward.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score is zero; the code is standard package setup, with no vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**All scores are consistent with the analysis.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or adjustment needed.",
