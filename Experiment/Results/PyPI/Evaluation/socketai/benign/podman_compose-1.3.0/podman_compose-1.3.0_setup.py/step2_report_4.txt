  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe a straightforward Python setup script for the 'podman-compose' package.\n- The code is standard, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The only potentially \"dynamic\" operation is reading the README.md file with a try-except block, which is a common and benign pattern.\n- Entry points are standard for CLI scripts, invoking functions from the package module.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malware indicators are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues are present. The code is typical for a setup script.\n- **Malicious code or malware:** None detected. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risks:** Negligible; standard package setup.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n### Potential inconsistencies:\n- No inconsistencies are evident. The scores are aligned with the analysis.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities:** None are made; the reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Suspicious assumptions:** None are present; the reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the uniformity and correctness of the reports, I agree with their conclusions.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The only operation is reading a README file, which is safe. Entry points are standard, and dependencies are typical.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
