{
  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for the 'podman-compose' package, configuring metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file safely; imports modules; defines setup parameters including entry points.",
  "sinks": "Executes 'podman_compose:main' via CLI, which could invoke user-defined code, but this is typical for CLI tools.",
  "flows": "User runs 'podman-compose' command, which calls 'podman_compose:main' in the package module.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static configuration. The only dynamic operation is reading README.md safely. The entry point is standard for CLI tools and does not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. Multiple reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign Python package setup with no malicious or security concerns. The execution of 'podman_compose:main' is standard for CLI tools and does not imply malicious behavior. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
