{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'podman-compose', including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, importing modules, defining setup parameters",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or vulnerable operations identified",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup configuration is static",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and uses setuptools for package setup. It reads the README.md file safely with a try-except block. All setup parameters are static strings and lists defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No code executes untrusted input, and no potentially malicious or obfuscated code is present. The dependencies are standard for a Python package development environment, and no network operations or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. The package appears to be benign and purely for distribution purposes.",
