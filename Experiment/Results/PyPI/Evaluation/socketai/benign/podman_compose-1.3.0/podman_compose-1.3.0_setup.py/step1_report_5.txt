{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'podman-compose', including metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static strings defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "Execution of entry points (console_scripts) which invoke the 'podman_compose:main' function; potential indirect execution of user-defined code in 'podman_compose' module.",
  "flows": "The setup process installs package metadata and dependencies, then creates executable scripts that call 'podman_compose.main'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or malicious code present. The only dynamic operation is reading a README file; no unsafe or obfuscated code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'os' and 'setuptools', reads a README file with exception handling, and then calls 'setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No user input processing, no network activity, and no code execution beyond standard package installation. The code structure and content are typical for Python package setup scripts. The 'try-except' block is straightforward for reading a file, with no malicious intent. The 'entry_points' define a CLI command that invokes a module function; this is standard practice. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It simply defines package metadata and installation instructions.",
