  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for deep merging data structures with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor typo does not impact security but should be corrected for correctness. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0 (or 0.1 in one case). All reports are accurate and consistent; no further action is necessary."
