  "purpose": "Utility functions for deep merging dictionaries and nested data structures.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as d1, d2, and other nested data structures passed into merge functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; operates solely on passed-in data structures in memory.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries (d1, d2) through recursive merge functions, combining data without external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo: in merge_dicts, float values are merged using merge_ints instead of merge_floats, which is a correctness issue but not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard deep merge utilities for dictionaries, lists, and primitive types. It uses standard Python modules and practices, with no network, file I/O, or external data handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The functions operate solely on provided data, and the logic is straightforward. The only flaw is the typo where float values are merged with an integer merge function, which affects correctness but not security. The malware score is appropriately 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is detected. The security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, which is acceptable given the benign nature of the code. The confidence scores are high, reflecting the clear benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for deep merging data structures with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor typo does not impact security but should be corrected for correctness. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0 (or 0.1 in one case). All reports are accurate and consistent; no further action is necessary.",
