{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for merging dictionaries and lists with customizable merge strategies, primarily for configuration or data structure management.",
  "sources": "Input data is expected from function arguments, especially the dictionaries passed to the merge functions.",
  "sinks": "Data flows mainly within function calls and recursive merges; no external sinks or data leaks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input dictionaries are recursively merged into a single dictionary using specified merge strategies; no external data transfer or external system interaction is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The functions perform straightforward data structure manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for deep merging dictionaries with customizable behaviors for merging lists, numbers, strings, and other types. The functions rely solely on standard library modules and standard Python constructs. There are no network calls, system modifications, or external data exfiltration mechanisms. The use of copy.deepcopy ensures data integrity without malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a utility for data management without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of recursive data merging utilities with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
