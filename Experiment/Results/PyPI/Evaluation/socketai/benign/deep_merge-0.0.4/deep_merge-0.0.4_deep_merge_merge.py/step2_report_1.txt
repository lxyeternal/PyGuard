  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a set of utility functions for deep merging dictionaries and nested data structures.\n- It uses standard Python features, such as copy.deepcopy and list.extend.\n- There are no network operations, no file I/O, no code injection, or external data handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- The functions operate solely on passed-in data structures.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on code issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain any bugs, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior. The logic appears sound for its purpose.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No evident errors. One minor point: in `merge_dicts`, when merging floats, it calls `merge_ints` instead of `merge_floats`. This is likely a typo, but it doesn't introduce security issues; it may affect merging behavior for floats, but not maliciously.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The only flaw is the potential typo in `merge_dicts`:\n  ```python\n  elif isinstance(d1[key], float) and isinstance(d2[key], float):\n      d1[key] = merge_ints(d1[key], d2[key], **kwargs)\n  ```\n  It should probably be:\n  ```python\n  d1[key] = merge_floats(d1[key], d2[key], **kwargs)\n  ```\n  but this is a correctness issue, not a security concern.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk scores:** The scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1). Given the benign nature, these seem reasonable.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- No reason to assign higher malware or risk scores, as no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The small security risk (0.1) in some reports seems to reflect a cautious stance due to the use of `deepcopy`, but this is standard and not risky.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior.\n- No external data leaks, no backdoors, no code injection, no data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The only technical note is the float merging typo, which should be corrected for correctness but does not impact security.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk, just a utility library)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a benign, standard utility for deep merging data structures. No malicious activity or security risks are present. The scores assigned are appropriate, with no need for adjustments.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Risk score: **0**",
