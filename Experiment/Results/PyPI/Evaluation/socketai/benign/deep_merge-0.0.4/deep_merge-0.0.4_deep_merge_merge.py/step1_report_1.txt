{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for merging dictionaries and data structures, with deep copy capabilities and customizable merge behaviors.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters such as dictionaries, lists, and values passed to merge functions.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks exist; data is processed within functions without network or system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through recursive merge functions, with no external data output or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. Use of `copy.deepcopy()` is standard for copying data.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles deep merging of dictionaries with customizable merge strategies. It uses standard Python data types and common functions like extend and deepcopy. No external data transmission, no code injection, nor suspicious logic found. All functions operate locally on provided data structures. No obfuscated or malicious constructs detected. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for data merging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data merging utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
