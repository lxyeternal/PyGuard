  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the reported concerns, and assess the scoring and reasoning.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions for deep merging dictionaries and nested data structures.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or network interactions are present.\n- The code uses standard Python modules (`copy`) and constructs.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The functions perform in-memory data manipulation with customizable merge strategies.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n**Summary:** No malicious activity, benign utility functions, high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The analysis correctly states that the code is a standard data merging utility.\n- No suspicious behavior, no external interactions, no obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Score justification:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code's nature. The security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n**Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with slight mention of a security risk of 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The report emphasizes the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk score of 0.1 seems slightly high given the absence of external or system interactions.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- The reasoning that the code is safe is sound.\n\n**Score justification:** The 0.1 security risk appears to be a conservative default or placeholder; it could be lowered to 0, given no evidence of risk.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n**Summary:** Same as above, no external data or malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The reasoning is consistent.\n- No external interactions, no suspicious patterns.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Score justification:** The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n**Summary:** Again, standard utility functions with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's functionality.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Score justification:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n**Summary:** Similar to others, no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward utility.\n- No external data flows, no obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Score justification:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, utility functions for data merging.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report at 0.1. Given the code's nature, a score of 0 is more accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimations:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities present.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is a standard, safe utility for merging nested data structures.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, though the small security risk of 0.1 could be adjusted to 0 for consistency.\n\n**Final recommendation:** All reports are justified; the code is benign. The overall security assessment should be:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's behavior and the detailed analysis provided.",
