{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for deep merging of dictionaries and lists with customizable merge strategies, primarily for data manipulation and configuration merging.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; the code only processes input parameters and arguments passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to files, send data over network, or interact with external systems. No sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows within functions as parameters are passed and manipulated; no untrusted data input or external data flow to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. The functions are straightforward, focused on data merging.",
  "analysis": "The code implements recursive merging of dictionaries, lists, and other data types with customizable merge functions. No external inputs, network activity, or system modifications are present. The functions operate purely on passed data structures. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system harm. The code appears to serve a data processing utility role.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard utility for deep merging data structures, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs safe, controlled data manipulations without external interactions.",
