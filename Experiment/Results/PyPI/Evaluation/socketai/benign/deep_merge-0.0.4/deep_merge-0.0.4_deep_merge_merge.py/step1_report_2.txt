  "purpose": "Utility functions for deep merging of dictionaries and lists with customizable merge strategies.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters for merging dictionaries and lists, and the actual dictionaries passed into the merge functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; functions primarily manipulate data structures in memory.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into merge functions, which then process and combine the provided dictionaries and nested structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard Python features and deep copying; no obfuscated or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions to deeply merge dictionaries and lists with customizable strategies for merging different data types. It employs standard Python modules (copy) and conventional control flow without any suspicious or malicious constructs. No external network calls, no handling of sensitive data, no code execution, or data exfiltration routines. The functions are typical for configuration management or data processing, with flexible merge strategies. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for safe data merging operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of data merging utilities with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs in-memory data processing only, with no suspicious side effects or external interactions.",
