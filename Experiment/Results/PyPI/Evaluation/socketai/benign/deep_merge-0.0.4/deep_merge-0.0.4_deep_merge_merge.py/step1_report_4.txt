  "purpose": "Utility functions for deep merging and updating nested data structures such as dictionaries and lists.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources are present; the code operates on data passed as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Data manipulation occurs within function arguments; no external sinks or data output mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows within functions through recursive merging; no external data flows or network communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The functions perform standard data merging operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides recursive merging functionalities for dictionaries and nested data structures, with customizable merge strategies. No external input/output or network operations are present. The functions operate purely on in-memory data passed as parameters, with no apparent malicious intent or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a general utility library for data merging, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of recursive data structure merging utilities. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified. The functions are safe and do not perform any harmful actions.",
