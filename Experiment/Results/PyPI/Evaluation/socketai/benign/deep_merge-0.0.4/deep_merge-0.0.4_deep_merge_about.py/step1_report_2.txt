{
  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for the 'deep_merge' Python utility package, providing package information such as version, author, description, and repository URL.",
  "sources": "Module-level attribute assignments providing package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; only static metadata definitions.",
  "flows": "None, as this code does not process any input or execute data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, dynamic code generation, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains metadata variables that describe the package. There are no functions, no data processing, no external data sources, nor any execution logic. It appears to be a standard header or module-level attribute setup typical in Python packages. No malicious indicators, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign package metadata declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
