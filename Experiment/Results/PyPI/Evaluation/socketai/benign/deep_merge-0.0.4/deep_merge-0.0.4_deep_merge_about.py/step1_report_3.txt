  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard metadata declarations with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments for package information such as name, version, author, email, description, URL, and license. There are no functions, input handling, external data processing, or code execution. This pattern is typical for a package's __init__.py or metadata file. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
