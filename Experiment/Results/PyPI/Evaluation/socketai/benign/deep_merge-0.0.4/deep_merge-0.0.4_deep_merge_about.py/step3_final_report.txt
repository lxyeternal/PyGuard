  "purpose": "Define package metadata such as name, version, author, and description for the 'deep_merge' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments setting package metadata (__name__, __version__, __author__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "None; code consists solely of static variable assignments with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static declaration of package metadata variables, typical in Python package initialization files. There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, metadata-only, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified given the static, metadata nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code does not pose any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. The existing reports and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
