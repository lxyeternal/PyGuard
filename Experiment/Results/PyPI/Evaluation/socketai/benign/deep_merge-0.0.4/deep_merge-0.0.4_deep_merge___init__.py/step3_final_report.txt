  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import/export code.",
  "flows": "Import from .merge -> export via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Incorrect __all__ assignment: assigning function objects instead of string names, leading to syntax errors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that imports functions and attempts to define __all__ for public API. The main issue is that __all__ is assigned a list of function objects rather than strings, which is invalid in Python and causes syntax errors. No dynamic code, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. The reports correctly identify this misuse as a bug, not malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is minimal, around 0.2, due to potential runtime errors but no security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with a syntax mistake in __all__ that should be corrected. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The primary concern is fixing the __all__ assignment to contain string names to prevent runtime errors.",
