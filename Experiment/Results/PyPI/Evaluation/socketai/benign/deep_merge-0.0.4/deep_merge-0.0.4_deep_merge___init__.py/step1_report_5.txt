  "purpose": "Export functions from the 'merge' module for use in other parts of the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions from a local module '.merge'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow outside of defining exports.",
  "anomalies": "The '__all__' variable is incorrectly assigned with function objects instead of strings. This is an anomaly, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module named 'merge' and attempts to define '__all__' to specify public API. However, '__all__' should be a list of strings, but here it contains function objects directly, which is a misuse. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or external data handling. The incorrect '__all__' assignment appears to be an error or oversight rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple module export setup with a syntax error in the '__all__' declaration. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The misuse of '__all__' is likely unintentional and not malicious.",
