{
  "purpose": "This code re-exports functions (merge, merge_dicts, append_lists, overwrite) from a local module for use in other parts of the package or project.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module .merge to import specific functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet, as it does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and exports functions without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual logic. The use of relative import is typical for package-internal code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from a local module and sets __all__ to define exports. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module re-export pattern, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It simply facilitates access to internal functions within the package.",
