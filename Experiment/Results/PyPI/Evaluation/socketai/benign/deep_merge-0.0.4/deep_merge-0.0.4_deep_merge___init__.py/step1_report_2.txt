{
  "purpose": "The code exports specific functions (merge, merge_dicts, append_lists, overwrite) from a local module for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported functions from the local module '.merge'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks where untrusted data could cause vulnerabilities; it only imports and exports functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks is present; the code solely re-exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no signs of obfuscation, hidden behavior, or malicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific functions from a local module named '.merge' and then declares an '__all__' list containing those functions for public API exposure. There are no data manipulations, no input/output operations, and no dynamic code execution. The simplicity indicates standard module export behavior without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a straightforward re-export of functions from a local module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
