  "purpose": "Re-export functions from the 'merge' module for external use",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions from a local module (.merge)",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks or external data handling present",
  "flows": "None; no data flow, input, or output operations observed",
  "anomalies": "Incorrect use of __all__; attempting to include function objects instead of string names, which is unconventional and potentially problematic",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from a local module named '.merge' and attempts to define the __all__ list with these functions. Typically, __all__ should contain strings representing the names of exported symbols, not the objects themselves. This could lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior. No input/output handling, network activity, or other suspicious behavior is present. The code's structure is straightforward, but the __all__ usage indicates a potential misunderstanding or typo that might cause issues in module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary function is to re-export imported functions. The only notable issue is the incorrect use of __all__, which should contain string names rather than function objects. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
