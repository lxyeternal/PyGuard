{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'merge' function, testing various behaviors and edge cases.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local variables defined within test functions, no external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; the code performs in-memory data manipulation only.",
  "flows": "Data is passed between variables and the 'merge' function, with no external data flows or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be straightforward testing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple test functions to validate the behavior of the 'merge' function, including simple merges, nested merges, and non-destructive merging. All data manipulations are performed on hardcoded, controlled variables. No external inputs, network operations, or file manipulations are present. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious activity. The functions seem to serve as legitimate unit tests, with no suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for a merge utility, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not contain malware, hidden backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The code is benign and safe.",
