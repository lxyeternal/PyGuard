  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment variables, function parameters, command-line arguments, and potentially external strings or URLs.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, dynamic code execution via eval/exec, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or function arguments flow into code execution functions or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, hardcoded URLs/strings, obfuscation indicators, suspicious structure, and dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code with eval/exec and obfuscation indicates high malicious potential; benign code shows standard data handling with no suspicious features; missing code limits assessment. Scores are consistent with features observed: high malware and obfuscation in suspicious code, low elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code in the suspicious report (Report 3) demonstrates high malicious intent due to eval/exec and obfuscation, warranting high malware and security risk scores. Other reports show benign or inconclusive code, with scores appropriately low. Overall, the scoring aligns with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
