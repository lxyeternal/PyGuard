  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple deprecation warning and import statement.\n- No report indicates any malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- The only potential concern raised is the use of `from FuelSDK import *` in report 5, which can be risky if the imported module is malicious or contains unwanted code, but this is not evidence of malicious activity itself.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Sound; it's a straightforward deprecation warning and import.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0.  \n**Verdict:** Correct. No change needed.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Valid; mentions the trustworthiness of FuelSDK, but no evidence of maliciousness.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.1.  \n**Note:** The risk score is low, which is appropriate. The malware score remains 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Potential adjustment:** Slightly increase confidence to 1, as the reasoning is solid.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Accurate; it's a standard deprecation notice and import.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0.\n- **No change needed.**\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Valid; emphasizes the routine nature of the warning and import.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0.\n- **No change needed.**\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Issue presence:** The warning about `import *` is valid, as wildcard imports can be risky.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correct that `import *` can obscure what is imported, but it does not indicate malicious activity per se.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.8, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Justification:** The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable given the potential for obscured malicious code within FuelSDK, but no evidence is present in this snippet.\n- **Potential adjustment:** Slightly increase confidence to 0.9, as the concern about `import *` is valid, but not necessarily malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scores and justifications:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk | Comments |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|----------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     | Correct; benign code. |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   | Appropriate; trust issue acknowledged but no evidence. |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     | Correct. |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     | Correct. |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   | Valid concern about `import *`, but no evidence of maliciousness. |\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** ~0.1–0.2 — minimal, mainly due to the use of `import *` which can be risky if FuelSDK is compromised.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The code itself is benign.\n- The main security concern is the trustworthiness of the FuelSDK package, especially with the wildcard import.\n- No evidence suggests malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final note:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (to reflect the minor concern about `import *`)\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and reasoning across all reports.",
