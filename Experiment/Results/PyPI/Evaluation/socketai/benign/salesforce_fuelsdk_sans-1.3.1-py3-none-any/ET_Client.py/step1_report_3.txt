{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a transitional wrapper or deprecation notice for users to migrate from an older module to the FuelSDK module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only issues a warning and imports a module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or other effects.",
  "flows": "The code flows from issuing a warning to importing the FuelSDK module, which is standard behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a DeprecationWarning informing users to switch to the FuelSDK module. It then imports the FuelSDK module for legacy support. The import statement itself is standard; there are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The warning indicates the current code is deprecated, not malicious. No suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward deprecation notice with a standard import for backward compatibility. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
