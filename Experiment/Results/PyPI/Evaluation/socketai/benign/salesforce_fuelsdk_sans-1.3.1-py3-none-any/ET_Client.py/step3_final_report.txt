{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning and imports the FuelSDK module, serving as a legacy support mechanism.",
  "sources": "The warning message and the import statement from FuelSDK.",
  "sinks": "The import statement could potentially introduce malicious code if FuelSDK is compromised, but the code itself does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code flow is limited to issuing a warning and importing a module; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from FuelSDK import *' in report 5, which can obscure imported symbols and pose security risks.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting of a deprecation warning and an import statement. No suspicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious constructs are present. The primary concern is the wildcard import in report 5, which can hide malicious code if FuelSDK is compromised, but no evidence of malicious activity exists within this snippet. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and a low security risk score (around 0.1 to 0.2) mainly due to import practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a deprecation notice and a legacy import. The main potential risk is the use of 'import *', which could be exploited if FuelSDK is malicious, but no such activity is evident here. Overall, the code is safe, with minimal security concerns primarily related to import style.",
