  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code issues a static deprecation warning and imports FuelSDK. No suspicious behavior, no data flow from untrusted sources.\n- **Assessment:** Completely benign. The warning is standard, and the import is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.5 (default for deprecation warnings), but given the benign nature, 0 seems appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's scores are reasonable; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the trustworthiness of FuelSDK. The only concern is the external package's potential maliciousness.\n- **Assessment:** The code itself is benign; the risk is external (the FuelSDK package). No data flow or malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.1 (due to external package trustworthiness). The report's risk score is 0.1, which seems appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above—standard deprecation warning and import, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The report assigns 0, which is consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous, straightforward deprecation warning and import.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. No issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Noted the use of 'import *', which can be suspicious due to obscurity, but no malicious activity detected.\n- **Assessment:** The wildcard import could be a concern, but not inherently malicious. The warning is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.2 (due to 'import *' usage). The report assigns 0.2, which is reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate; no change necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple deprecation warning plus a module import.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- The only minor concern is the use of 'import *' in report 5, which is noted but not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with benign code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code, a low risk score (around 0.0 to 0.1) is appropriate, mainly considering external package trustworthiness.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk:** 0.1 — minor concern over external package trustworthiness and 'import *', but overall very low risk.\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, serving solely as a deprecation notice and a legacy import. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, with perhaps a slight reduction in risk score to 0, given the lack of any suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Ensure the external FuelSDK package is from a trusted source, as the import itself could pose a risk if compromised, but the code snippet itself is safe.",
