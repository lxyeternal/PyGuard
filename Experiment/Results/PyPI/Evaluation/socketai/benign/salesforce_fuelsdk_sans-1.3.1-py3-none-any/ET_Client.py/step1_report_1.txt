{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a deprecation warning and import statement for the FuelSDK module, indicating legacy support for older codebases.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded warning message string and imports the FuelSDK module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, code execution, or other effects.",
  "flows": "The warning message is generated when the module is imported, but no data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The warning is standard, and the import is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a deprecation warning to inform users to transition to the new FuelSDK module and imports FuelSDK for legacy support. The warning uses a static message, and the import is from a third-party library. There are no suspicious behaviors, code injections, or malicious constructs. The code appears to be a simple, intentional deprecation notice with a standard import statement.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely as a deprecation notice and an import for legacy support. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
