{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning about a module and then imports the FuelSDK module for legacy support.",
  "sources": "The warning message (warnings.warn) and the import statement (from FuelSDK import *).",
  "sinks": "The import statement could potentially import malicious or vulnerable code if FuelSDK is compromised, but by itself, it is simply importing a module.",
  "flows": "The warning message is displayed when the script runs; then, the code imports the FuelSDK module, which could potentially execute its initialization code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('import *') can obscure the imported symbols and potentially import unintended or malicious code. The warning message indicates deprecation, but does not directly imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily issues a deprecation warning and performs a module import. The use of 'import *' can be suspicious because it can hide imported functions or variables. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors. The warning suggests that the module is being phased out, not that it is malicious. Overall, the code is straightforward and does not exhibit malicious behavior, but the wildcard import warrants cautious review of the FuelSDK module itself. The code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a deprecation notice followed by a module import. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks directly in this snippet. The main concern is the use of 'import *', which can obscure imported content, but this does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
