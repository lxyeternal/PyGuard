{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning for a module and imports the FuelSDK module for legacy support.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the warnings.warn() function and the import statement for FuelSDK.",
  "sinks": "Potential import of a third-party module (FuelSDK), which could be malicious if compromised, but no direct sink for untrusted data is present.",
  "flows": "The warning informs users about future removal; the import brings in external functionality. No data flow from untrusted sources is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code only issues a deprecation warning and imports a module; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward: it warns users about deprecation of its current module and imports the FuelSDK module for legacy purposes. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. The import could pose a risk if the FuelSDK package is malicious, but based on this code alone, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard deprecation warning and a module import with no signs of malicious behavior. The only concern relates to the trustworthiness of the external FuelSDK package, but the code itself is benign.",
