  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, its behavior, and the associated scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Code Analysis:**  \n  Static code: warning message and import statement. No dynamic or untrusted data.  \n  No suspicious behavior, code injection, or malicious constructs.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — consistent.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n  - Risk: 0 — benign.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Fully benign, standard deprecation and import.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Code Analysis:**  \n  Similar to Report 1, with an emphasis on the external package's trustworthiness.  \n  No suspicious code, only import and warning.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malicious code.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — straightforward code.  \n  - Security risk: 0.1 — minor concern about the external package, but not about the code itself.  \n- **Justification:**  \n  The only potential risk stems from the external FuelSDK package being malicious or compromised, but the code snippet itself does not introduce malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores are reasonable. The small security risk score (0.1) is justified, given the dependency on an external package.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Code Analysis:**  \n  Same pattern: warning + import. No suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  All zeros for malware and obfuscation, risk zero.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Correctly identified as benign.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Code Analysis:**  \n  Similar to previous reports; no anomalies.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  All zeros for malware and obfuscation, risk zero.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Accurate.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Code Analysis:**  \n  Slightly different: use of `from FuelSDK import *`.  \n  Wildcard import can be suspicious because it obscures what is imported, potentially hiding malicious code.  \n  The warning is standard, but the import style is less ideal.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malicious code detected.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — higher than others due to the wildcard import, which can be considered a security concern.  \n- **Analysis:**  \n  The main concern is the wildcard import, which can be risky because it makes it harder to audit imported symbols and could inadvertently import malicious code if the package is compromised.\n\n**Justification for the higher risk score:**  \nWhile the code itself is benign, the use of `import *` can be a vector for hidden malicious behavior if the imported module is compromised. It warrants a slightly higher risk score, but not malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Scores and Recommendations**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk | Comments |\n|----------|---------|--------------|----------------|----------|\n| 1        | 0       | 0            | 0              | Correct |\n| 2        | 0       | 0            | 0.1            | Correct |\n| 3        | 0       | 0            | 0              | Correct |\n| 4        | 0       | 0            | 0              | Correct |\n| 5        | 0       | 0            | 0.2            | Justified due to wildcard import |\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- The malware scores are all appropriate; no malicious code is detected.\n- The obfuscated scores are correct; code is straightforward.\n- The security risk score for report 5 could be slightly increased to 0.2, which aligns with the concern about wildcard imports.\n- Overall, the code is benign, with the main concern being the import style in report 5.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (all reports are benign)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n- **Risk:** Approximately 0.1–0.2, mainly due to the wildcard import concern in report 5.\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code snippets are standard deprecation notices and imports, with minimal security concern primarily related to import practices rather than malicious intent.",
