{
  "purpose": "This code issues a deprecation warning for the current module and imports the FuelSDK module for legacy support.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only generates a warning message and imports a module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could leak or cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the only flow is the warning message generation and module import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the warning is standard practice for deprecated modules, and the import is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a DeprecationWarning advising users to switch to the FuelSDK module, which is imported afterward. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors. The import statement is common for module loading. The warning indicates an intent to phase out the current module, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a routine deprecation warning and imports a module for backward compatibility. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks present.",
