  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a deprecation notice and a legacy import. The main potential risk is the use of 'import *', which could be exploited if FuelSDK is malicious, but no such activity is evident here. Overall, the code is safe, with minimal security concerns primarily related to import style."
