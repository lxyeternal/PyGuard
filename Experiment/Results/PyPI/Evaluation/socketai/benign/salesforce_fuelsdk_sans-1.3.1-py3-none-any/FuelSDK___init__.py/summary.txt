  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing targeted runtime library patching without malicious intent. The absence of secrets, network activity, or obfuscation supports a safe assessment. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The slightly elevated risk score (~0.2) reflects the unusual patching but does not indicate malicious activity."
