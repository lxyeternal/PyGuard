{
  "purpose": "The code performs runtime patching of the 'suds' library by replacing internal classes and properties with custom implementations, then imports SDK components. It appears to be aimed at customizing or fixing library behavior during runtime.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports modules and replaces class attributes within the 'suds' library.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks, network transmissions, or data leaks present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing custom patch classes to assigning them to the 'suds' library attributes, with no external data or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "Runtime patching of an external library is unusual but not inherently malicious; no secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs targeted runtime modifications to the 'suds' SOAP client library, likely for bug fixes or compatibility adjustments. It imports SDK components without processing untrusted data or executing dynamic code. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The patching is unusual but can be legitimate in SDK setup or customization contexts. No malicious indicators, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The code's behavior aligns with SDK initialization and patching for legitimate purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing targeted runtime library patching without malicious intent. The absence of secrets, network activity, or obfuscation supports a safe assessment. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The slightly elevated risk score (~0.2) reflects the unusual patching but does not indicate malicious activity.",
