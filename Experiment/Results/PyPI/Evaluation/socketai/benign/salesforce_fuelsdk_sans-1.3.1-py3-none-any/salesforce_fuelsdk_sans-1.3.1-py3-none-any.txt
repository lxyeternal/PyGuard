      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a deprecation notice and a legacy import. The main potential risk is the use of 'import *', which could be exploited if FuelSDK is malicious, but no such activity is evident here. Overall, the code is safe, with minimal security concerns primarily related to import style."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing targeted runtime library patching without malicious intent. The absence of secrets, network activity, or obfuscation supports a safe assessment. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The slightly elevated risk score (~0.2) reflects the unusual patching but does not indicate malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK wrapper for Salesforce Marketing Cloud API entities. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and risk score (~0.1) are justified based on the analysis. The code can be considered safe and suitable for use in supply chain contexts."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SDK client for Salesforce Marketing Cloud with no malicious or sabotage activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3), primarily due to external dependencies and configuration handling. It is safe to use with standard security best practices applied."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SDK for web service interactions with no malicious features or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified, and the security risk score of 0.2 reflects minimal concern, primarily due to dynamic request construction which is typical in SDKs. No evidence of malicious intent or sabotage is detected."
