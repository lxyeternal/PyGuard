  "purpose": "Wrapper classes for Salesforce Marketing Cloud API entities, enabling CRUD and related operations via SDK methods.",
  "sources": "Class properties such as 'props', 'columns', 'search_filter', and method parameters used to construct API payloads.",
  "sinks": "API calls (ET_Post, ET_Patch, ET_Delete, ET_Get) transmitting data to external services; responses stored in class attributes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class properties into API payloads, which are sent via SDK functions, with responses captured for further use.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of commented pseudo-code snippets (e.g., Ruby code), but these are benign comments and do not affect execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of SDK wrapper classes for Salesforce Marketing Cloud entities, performing standard CRUD operations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic. Comments include non-executable snippets, which are harmless. The data flow is typical for SDK wrappers, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK wrapper for Salesforce Marketing Cloud API entities. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and risk score (~0.1) are justified based on the analysis. The code can be considered safe and suitable for use in supply chain contexts.",
