  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to determine if the issues are present, and assess the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a comprehensive SDK for interacting with SOAP and REST APIs, specifically for Salesforce Marketing Cloud (ExactTarget).\n- It includes classes for describe, configure, get, create, update, delete, pagination, and support functions.\n- Uses requests library for REST calls, and SOAP client for SOAP calls.\n- Handles responses, constructs requests dynamically from input parameters, manages tokens.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- Exception handling is generic.\n- No signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, straightforward response parsing.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low)\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code. The report is thorough and reasonable.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard API client practices, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No suspicious logic.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** Also describes standard SDK patterns, no malicious behavior, safe handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues detected.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** Similar to above, confirms legitimate API client behavior, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** Same as others, standard API wrapper, no malicious signs.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern due to dynamic URL and payload assembly from untrusted input, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n**Justification for scores:**\n- The code is a standard API client library, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- Dynamic URL and payload construction are typical for such SDKs but should be used carefully with untrusted input.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.\n- Response parsing and request handling are straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (low, standard API interaction risks)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe provided code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK for interacting with SOAP and REST APIs, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should remain as is.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Work completed step-by-step:**\n- Confirmed no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- Scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- Overall, the code appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
