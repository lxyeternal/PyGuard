  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client wrapper for SOAP and REST APIs, with no signs of malicious activity. It handles responses and requests securely, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code appears to be a typical API wrapper, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk score is appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API client behavior with proper token management, request construction, and response parsing. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code's logic is standard, and no malicious features are evident. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive SDK for web service interactions, with standard request and response handling. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's structure. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a structured SDK for Salesforce Marketing Cloud API interactions, with standard practices and no malicious features.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, the code is a standard API client with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature as an API wrapper. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is consistent; no obfuscation is detected.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 across all reports indicates low but non-zero concern, primarily due to the dynamic URL and payload construction from untrusted input. This is standard for API clients, and the low score reflects minimal security concern.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at:\n\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, standard API client library with no malicious or obfuscated features. The current scores accurately reflect the code's security posture.",
