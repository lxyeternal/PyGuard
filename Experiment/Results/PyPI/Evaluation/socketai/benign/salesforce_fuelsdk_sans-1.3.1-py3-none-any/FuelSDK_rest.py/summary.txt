  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SDK for web service interactions with no malicious features or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified, and the security risk score of 0.2 reflects minimal concern, primarily due to dynamic request construction which is typical in SDKs. No evidence of malicious intent or sabotage is detected."
