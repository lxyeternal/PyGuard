{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract class 'ErrorDefinition' used for modeling error properties with support for message formatting, hierarchies, and validation in a structured manner.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; the code primarily defines a class and its properties/methods.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output channels are present; the code only provides data structures and validation methods.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data. The validation method ensures message parameters match the format but does not process untrusted input directly.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for error modeling; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The methods use conventional Python features; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an abstract class with properties for error codes, message formats, and hierarchies, along with validation functions. It uses standard Python practices like properties, abstract methods, and class hierarchies. No external data handling, network operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. The validation method only checks string formatting correctness. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for error modeling and validation. It contains no malware, suspicious activity, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use as part of a larger codebase. The absence of external data handling, network operations, or code obfuscation supports this conclusion.",
