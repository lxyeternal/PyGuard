  "purpose": "Provides an abstract class for structured error definitions, including message formatting, hierarchy, validation, and optional details URI.",
  "sources": "Message format property, class hierarchy, validation method, error code properties",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input processing beyond string formatting validation",
  "flows": "Validation checks string formatting with provided parameters; no external data flow or malicious payloads",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard use of Python features; no obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured abstract class for error modeling. It employs standard Python features such as properties, abstract methods, and string formatting. It does not perform any network activity, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. The validation method only checks string formatting correctness. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. Multiple reviews confirm the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious, and well-designed component for error handling. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The current assessments and scores are appropriate and require no changes.",
