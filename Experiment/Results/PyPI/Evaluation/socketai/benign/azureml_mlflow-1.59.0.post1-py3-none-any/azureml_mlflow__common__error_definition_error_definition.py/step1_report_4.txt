{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for error definitions that include properties for error messages, hierarchy, and metadata, intended for use in a larger system for structured error handling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input points are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points involving untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted inputs to critical operations, as the code primarily defines an abstract class with properties and methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard for defining an abstract class with properties and validation methods; no anomalies or suspicious patterns such as code injection, hidden behaviors, or malicious code are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'ErrorDefinition' with various properties and methods related to error handling, message formatting, and hierarchy. It contains no external data sources, no network operations, and no suspicious behavior. The methods focus on safe string formatting, validation of message parameters, and representing error metadata. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscation. The class is designed for structured error management within an application and does not perform any potentially harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard abstract class used for defining error properties and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely for structured error handling and validation within a larger application framework.",
