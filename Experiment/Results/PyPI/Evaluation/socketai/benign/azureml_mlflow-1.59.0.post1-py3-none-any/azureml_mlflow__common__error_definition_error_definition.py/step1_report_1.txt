{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract class 'ErrorDefinition' used for modeling error properties in a system, primarily to ensure safe logging and structured error handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input in the form of class properties and methods, such as 'message_format', 'details_uri', and other property getters. No external data inputs are directly read.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive information could be included if subclasses improperly implement 'message_format' or 'details_uri'. The code itself does not perform any data leakage or malicious operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this code; it mostly provides a framework for defining error properties. Validation method 'validate' checks message parameters but does not process external data beyond format substitution.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured abstract class without suspicious or malicious code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident. There is no network activity, system modification, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an abstract base class for error definitions with properties and methods aimed at safe error message formatting, hierarchy, and validation. It employs Python's standard features, such as property decorators, abstract methods, and string formatting validation. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network access, or code injection, are detected. The code’s purpose is to enforce structured and safe error reporting, not to perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, well-structured framework component for error handling with no malicious intent or harmful behavior. It does not include any suspicious or malicious operations and solely focuses on error property modeling.",
