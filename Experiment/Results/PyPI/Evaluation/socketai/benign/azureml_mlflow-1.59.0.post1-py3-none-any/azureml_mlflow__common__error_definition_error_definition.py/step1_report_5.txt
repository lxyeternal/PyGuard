{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract class 'ErrorDefinition' for standardized error handling, including properties and validation methods for error messages and hierarchy.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class properties, methods, and docstrings. It also reads the class hierarchy and string manipulation functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the 'format' method on 'message_format' for message validation, and the __str__ and __repr__ methods that generate JSON strings.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class properties and methods such as 'message_format' and 'error_hierarchy' to string representations and validation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior are present. The code uses standard Python features and libraries without obfuscation or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an error abstraction class, with properties for error metadata, message validation, and hierarchy management. It uses standard class inheritance, properties, and string formatting. No external data sources, network calls, or suspicious code behaviors are identified. The 'format' method is used safely for message validation, and no untrusted inputs or system commands are executed. The class is designed solely for error handling and logging, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured error abstraction class without any malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
