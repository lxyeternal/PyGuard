  "purpose": "Assign a version string to a variable, typically used for package metadata.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of the string '1.59.0.post1' to the variable VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment with no dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static assignment of a version string, with no input/output, external calls, or dynamic logic. All reports correctly identify this as benign. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The code poses no security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version string assignment with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
