{
  "purpose": "Provides factory functions to instantiate AzureML and MLflow components such as artifact repositories, stores, model registries, and project backends, facilitating integration with Azure Machine Learning services.",
  "sources": "Input parameters like 'artifact_uri' and 'store_uri' which are URIs; internal SDK functions such as 'load_service_context' that may perform network requests; external SDK modules imported within functions.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of SDK classes that may internally perform network communication; no direct processing of untrusted data or execution of code from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Input URIs are validated and passed to internal loader functions or SDK constructors; these loaders may perform network requests to retrieve service contexts; instantiated objects are returned for further use.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected; modules are imported within functions, which is standard for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward SDK wrapper functions that validate input URIs and instantiate SDK classes for AzureML and MLflow components. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or data leakage are present. The functions rely on internal SDK methods that may perform network requests, but this is typical for cloud service SDKs. The minimal validation and standard import patterns do not introduce security issues. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are justified. The security risk score (0.1-0.2) reflects the potential for network activity within SDKs but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate SDK infrastructure code for AzureML and MLflow integration, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
