  "purpose": "Modify the __path__ variable for package resource discovery",
  "sources": "__import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sinks identified",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with 'pkgutil' is standard; no suspicious or obfuscated code features",
  "analysis": "The code adjusts the __path__ variable using the extend_path method from the pkgutil module, which is a common pattern in namespace packages. No external inputs, no data manipulation, no malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and typical for Python namespace package support.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace package pattern with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and legitimate.",
