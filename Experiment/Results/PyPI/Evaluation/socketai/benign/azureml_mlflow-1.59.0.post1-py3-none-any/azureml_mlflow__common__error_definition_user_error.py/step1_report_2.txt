{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom user error classes for Azure Machine Learning SDK, categorizing various user input and resource errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements from azureml.mlflow._common._error_definition modules, class definitions, and property methods returning error string constants.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external communications present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; class definitions mainly map error types to string messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be a straightforward error class hierarchy with no suspicious constructs or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a structured set of custom error classes with associated error message formats. It imports error string constants and uses properties to return these messages. No user input handling, network operations, file access, or external calls are present. The classes serve as a way to categorize and throw specific errors in the SDK, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign error handling framework for the AzureML SDK. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It functions purely as a structured error definition hierarchy, with no suspicious or obfuscated code.",
