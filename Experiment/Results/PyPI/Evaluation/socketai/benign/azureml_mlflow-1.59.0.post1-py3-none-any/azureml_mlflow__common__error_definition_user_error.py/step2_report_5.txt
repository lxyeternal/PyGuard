  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the reports and the underlying code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for user errors in AzureML.\n- It imports error string constants from external modules.\n- Each class has a property `message_format` returning a static string.\n- No dynamic data processing, network operations, or external inputs are involved.\n- The code is purely declarative, focusing on error categorization and messaging.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Presence of Issues in the Code\n- **Confirm if issues are present:**  \n  The code appears standard, well-structured, and free of any suspicious or malicious constructs.  \n  **Verdict:** No issues detected.\n\n### 2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports\n- **Logical flaws:**  \n  All reports consistently identify the code as a straightforward error class hierarchy with static message strings.  \n  **No logical flaws** or mistakes are evident in the reports.\n\n- **Potential misinterpretations:**  \n  The reports do not overstate or assume malicious intent; they correctly note the absence of dynamic or external data processing.\n\n### 3. Scores and Their Reasonableness\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is appropriate given the static nature of the code and absence of malicious patterns.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign `securityRisk: 0`, which is accurate. No external data, code injection, or network activity is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `obfuscated: 0`, which aligns with the clear, straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports give `securityRisk: 0` and a confidence of 1, which is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n### 4. Justification for Higher Risk Scores\n- Since all evidence points to static, well-structured error class definitions with no malicious or risky behavior, **no higher risk scores are justified**.\n\n### 5. Challenging Assumptions about Vulnerabilities\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n### 6. Consistency of Scores with Reports\n- All reports' scores are consistent with their analysis and the code content.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment and Recommendations**\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (correct)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, benign error handling framework with no security issues.**\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis: the code is purely declarative, static, and free of malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed. The code is safe, standard, and poses no security risk.",
