{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for user errors in AzureML, with static error message strings.",
  "sources": "External modules providing error string constants (AzureMLErrorStrings).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; static error messages do not process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes return static strings, no dynamic data or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward static class hierarchy with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured set of custom exception classes for AzureML, relying on external string constants. It contains no dynamic code, network calls, or data processing. The error strings are static, and the class hierarchy is logical. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of error classes for an SDK, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
