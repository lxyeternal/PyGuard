{
  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of user-related error classes for use within the Azure Machine Learning framework, providing structured error handling and messaging.",
  "sources": "Import statements (reading external modules), class definitions with properties that reference external error string constants.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; error message formatting is based on static error strings from imported modules.",
  "flows": "Error class properties access static string constants; no dynamic data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. Use of class inheritance and properties appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines error classes with message formats linked to external string constants. It uses typical Python class structures, inheritance, and property decorators. No code executes external commands, network operations, or manipulates untrusted inputs. All data used for messages are static references. The import statements are standard and do not introduce security risks. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error handling class hierarchy with no malicious behavior or security risks. It only references external, presumably safe, string constants for messaging. No malicious activity, supply chain attack vectors, or security issues are evident.",
