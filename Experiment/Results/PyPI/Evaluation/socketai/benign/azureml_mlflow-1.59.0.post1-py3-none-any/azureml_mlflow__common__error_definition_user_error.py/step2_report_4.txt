  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code in detail, following the step-by-step guidelines:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward hierarchy of custom exception classes, primarily serving as structured error definitions.\n   - All classes inherit from base classes and return static error message strings via properties.\n   - No dynamic data processing, user input handling, or external interactions are present.\n   - The error strings are imported from external modules, which are presumably safe and controlled.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is static, with no data flow from untrusted sources or external system calls.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports; they are consistent and thorough.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No issues are identified that would warrant a higher risk score.\n   - The code is purely declarative, defining error classes with static messages.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across reports.\n   - This is appropriate; no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as standard error class definitions.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities or attack vectors are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable adjustments are apparent.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n- The code is a typical, well-structured set of error classes used in SDKs.\n- It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated/malicious logic.\n- The external string resources are presumed safe, and the code only references them.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Based on the provided reports and code, I would assign the following scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n  - **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n  \nThese scores reflect the benign, static, and standard nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of error classes for an SDK. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present. The reports are accurate and consistent in their assessment.",
