  "purpose": "Define custom user error classes for Azure ML workflows, organizing various error types for handling user input issues, resource not found errors, and other common error scenarios.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, property methods returning error string constants.",
  "sinks": "Property methods returning error strings; no untrusted input processing or external data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "Class definitions with property methods returning predefined error message strings; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs detected. The code purely defines error classes with message strings; no code execution or data manipulation occurs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured set of class definitions representing different error types, each returning a predefined error message string from a separate constants module. It primarily uses inheritance and properties to organize error messaging. There are no data inputs, external data processing, or dynamic code execution. No evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscated logic is present. The code serves as a standard error handling framework within a larger application context.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, well-structured set of custom error classes intended for use in Azure Machine Learning workflows. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard pattern for organizing error messages and does not involve any potentially harmful code or data leaks.",
