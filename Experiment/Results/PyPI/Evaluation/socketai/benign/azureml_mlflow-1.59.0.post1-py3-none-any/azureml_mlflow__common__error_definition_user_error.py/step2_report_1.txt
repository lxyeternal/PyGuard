  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to assess the potential security implications, scores, and overall validity.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward hierarchy of custom exception classes, each returning static error message strings.\n- No dynamic data handling, external data processing, network operations, or user input parsing is present.\n- The code relies on external string constants for error messages, which are presumed to be safe.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n- The code appears to be a standard, well-structured error handling framework for the AzureML SDK.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. The code is purely class and property definitions with static strings.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Logic or reasoning errors:** None detected. The code is standard and consistent.\n- **Security flaws:** None apparent. No external inputs, no dynamic code, no external calls.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (not explicitly shown but implied). Given the absence of any security issues, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Why the risk score should be 0:** The code does not perform any operations that could compromise security. It is purely a static class hierarchy for error messaging.\n- **Why the malware score should be 0:** No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- **Potential assumptions:** Some reports mention the error strings are imported from external modules. If those modules are compromised, there could be a risk, but based solely on this code snippet, the static nature and no external data flow imply safety.\n\n### Challenging claims:\n- All reports assume the code is benign and purely structural, which is consistent with the code provided.\n- No report suggests any suspicious behavior that warrants concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, static class hierarchy defining custom exceptions with static message strings. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior that could pose a security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, standard for error handling in SDKs, and poses no security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated, with a risk score of zero.",
