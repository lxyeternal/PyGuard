{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of custom error classes for handling various user-related errors in Azure Machine Learning workflows, primarily for structured exception handling and user feedback.",
  "sources": "Import statements (abc, azureml.mlflow._common._error_definition), class definitions, property methods returning string constants",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code only defines classes and properties without executing any data or performing network operations",
  "flows": "No data or control flow involving untrusted input to critical sinks; class properties return static error strings, no dynamic execution or data flow observed",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. Use of error string constants suggests standardized error messaging rather than malicious code. No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no external system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard definition of custom exception classes for structured error handling. It imports necessary modules, defines a hierarchy of error classes with properties returning static error message strings from a presumed external source, and organizes error types for user input validation, data issues, resource issues, and authorization errors. No external data, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present. The classes are purely declarative and do not contain code that could be malicious or maliciously manipulated. There are no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of error class definitions intended for structured exception handling in Azure ML SDK components. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. The code does not perform any network, file, or system operations beyond class and property declarations. Overall, it is safe and aligns with typical SDK error handling patterns.",
