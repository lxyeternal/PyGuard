  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the reports and the code:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for user-related errors in AzureML.\n   - It imports error string constants from external modules.\n   - Each class has a `message_format` property returning a static string from `AzureMLErrorStrings`.\n   - The classes are organized to categorize errors (e.g., BadArgument, BadData, NotFound, etc.).\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Code or Vulnerabilities:**\n   - No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data processing from untrusted sources.\n   - All error messages are static, referencing external constants.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The structure is typical for an SDK's error handling framework.\n\n3. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes:**\n   - The hierarchy and class design are consistent and logical.\n   - The code adheres to standard Python practices for custom exceptions.\n   - No evident mistakes or logical errors.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the static nature and lack of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the static, benign code.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - The code relies on external string constants (`AzureMLErrorStrings`). If these constants are maliciously altered, it could cause misleading error messages, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n   - No evidence of supply chain attack vectors within this code alone.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, well-structured error class hierarchy.\n   - No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n   - The reports' conclusions and scores are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assigned scores:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is benign, standard SDK error handling infrastructure, with no security concerns.",
