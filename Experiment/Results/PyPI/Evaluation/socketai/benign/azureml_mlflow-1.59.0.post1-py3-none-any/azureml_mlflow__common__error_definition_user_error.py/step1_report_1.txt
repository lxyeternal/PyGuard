{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for user-related errors in AzureML, with specific error types for input validation, resource management, and system issues.",
  "sources": "Imports error string definitions from external modules; class property methods returning static error message strings.",
  "sinks": "Error message strings used in exception handling; no untrusted input or data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external untrusted sources to critical sinks such as network or file system. Error messages are static strings assigned via properties.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution. The code is primarily class and property definitions with static content.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for user error handling, with structured message formats retrieved from external string resources. The classes follow a consistent pattern, utilizing properties to return predefined strings. No code execution, external data processing, or network operations are present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code's structure and content appear to be standard for an error handling framework in a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of error classes for an AzureML SDK, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It contains static message definitions and class hierarchies without dynamic or untrusted input handling.",
