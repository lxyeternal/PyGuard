  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, static class hierarchy defining custom exception classes for AzureML, with error message strings sourced from external constants modules.\n- No dynamic data processing, external inputs, network operations, or code execution are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The code's purpose appears to be structured error handling within the SDK.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code:** None are present. The code is purely class and property definitions with static strings.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, security risks:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as there is no data flow from untrusted sources or dynamic code execution.\n- **Scores assigned:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk as 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, justified by the static, benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since there are no vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as a benign, standard error class hierarchy.\n- No changes needed in the scoring or reasoning.\n- The detailed analysis correctly states that the code is safe, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Justification:**  \n- The code is purely declarative, with no dynamic or external data handling.  \n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.  \n- The static nature and reliance on external string constants do not pose security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, safe error handling class hierarchy with no malicious or security concerns.",
