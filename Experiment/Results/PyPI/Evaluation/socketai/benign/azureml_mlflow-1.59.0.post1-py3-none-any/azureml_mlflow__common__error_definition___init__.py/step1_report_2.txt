{
  "purpose": "Define and export specific error handling classes and decorators for Azure Machine Learning SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.azureml_error and .utils.error_decorator). No external data input or output observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code only performs import and export operations without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two components from local modules and defines an __all__ list for exports. It is standard practice for Python packages to organize exports. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. There are no external data sources, sinks, or flow paths that could pose security risks. The code's simplicity and lack of dynamic or unsafe operations indicate low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for exporting classes and functions. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears safe and intentionally designed for SDK organization.",
