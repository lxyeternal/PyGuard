  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to determine the accuracy of their assessments and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a minimal module that imports two local modules and defines `__all__`.\n- There are no external inputs, network operations, dynamic code execution, or data processing.\n- The code appears to be standard for Python package structure, focusing on module exports.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Define module exports for AzureML error handling and utility functions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as straightforward, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Define and export specific error handling classes and decorators.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is standard and low risk.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Defines module exports for AzureML error handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes the code is boilerplate with no security concerns.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Defines and exports classes/functions related to error handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate, straightforward, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Define public API exports.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is simple and safe.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identified no malicious activity. I agree with a malware score of 0 across all.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree on 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the simplicity and lack of dynamic or risky operations, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**However,** considering the context:\n- These are all very similar snippets, standard for package exports.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n- The overall security posture is very low risk.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications needed.",
