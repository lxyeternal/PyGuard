  "purpose": "Defines module exports for AzureML error handling and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules 'azureml_error' and 'utils.error_decorator'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports internal components and defines an __all__ list for exports. It contains no dynamic logic, network activity, or data processing. The code structure is standard for package initialization. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, risk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign module setup with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
