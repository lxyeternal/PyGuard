  "sources": "Import statements for azureml_error and error_decorator modules",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or code execution",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules do not establish data flow paths involving untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports two local modules, likely part of a larger package, and defines __all__ for export. It does not contain any input handling, network access, or other risky operations. The copyright notice is standard. There is no evidence of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module initialization with standard imports and export definitions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues in this snippet.",
