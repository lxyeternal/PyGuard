  "sources": "Import statements importing local modules (.azureml_error and .utils.error_decorator).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows from untrusted sources or external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only imports and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two internal modules and declares an __all__ list for module exports. There are no external inputs, network operations, or data manipulation. No signs of malicious intent or security issues are evident in this minimal module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup for error handling and decorators, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
