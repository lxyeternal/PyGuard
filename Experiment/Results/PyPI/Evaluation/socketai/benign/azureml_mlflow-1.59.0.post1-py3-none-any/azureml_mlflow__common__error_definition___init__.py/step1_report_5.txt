  "purpose": "Define public API exports for AzureML error handling modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules (.azureml_error, .utils.error_decorator).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only imports modules and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules, then defines the __all__ variable to specify exported symbols. There are no external data inputs, network interactions, or data processing steps. The code is minimal and straightforward, focused solely on module exports. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module defining exports with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears legitimate and safe.",
