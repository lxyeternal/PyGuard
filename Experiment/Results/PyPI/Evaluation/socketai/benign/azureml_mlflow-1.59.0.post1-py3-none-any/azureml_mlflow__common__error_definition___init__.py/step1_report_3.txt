  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow paths to untrusted input, no data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components and defines the __all__ list to specify module exports. It contains only import statements and a list definition with no runtime logic, data handling, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code appears to be standard module boilerplate for Python package structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module initialization snippet with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
