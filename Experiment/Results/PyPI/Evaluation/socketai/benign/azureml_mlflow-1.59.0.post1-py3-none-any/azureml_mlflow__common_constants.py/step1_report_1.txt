  "purpose": "Define environment variable keys for Azure ML service configuration and authentication.",
  "sources": "Class attributes representing environment variable names.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct data sinks, no untrusted data flows or output operations.",
  "flows": "The code only defines constants; no data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code straightforwardly defines string constants.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a simple class with static string attributes for environment variable names used in Azure ML workflows. There are no functions, no data input handling, and no dynamic code execution. The variables appear to be standard environment variable keys, not sensitive data themselves. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign definition of environment variable names for Azure ML service configuration. No malware or security risks are evident.",
