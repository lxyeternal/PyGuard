  "purpose": "Defines a class containing environment variable names related to Azure ML workflows.",
  "sources": "Class attributes defining string constants for environment variable names.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only declares constants without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code only stores environment variable names as static strings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with static string attributes representing environment variable keys used in Azure ML contexts. It does not read, write, or process any external or untrusted data. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward and standard for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple configuration holder for environment variable names related to Azure ML. It does not contain malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. No anomalies or malware signals are detected.",
