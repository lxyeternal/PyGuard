  "purpose": "Defines a class containing Azure ML environment variable keys for use in scripts or applications.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded environment variable key strings within the class attributes.",
  "targets": "Potential use of these keys to access environment variables or configuration data.",
  "flows": "Code provides constants; no data flow or untrusted input handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a class with static string attributes representing environment variable names related to Azure ML. There are no input handling, data processing, network operations, or execution of untrusted data. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration/constants container. No suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign class containing environment variable keys used for Azure Machine Learning configurations. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
