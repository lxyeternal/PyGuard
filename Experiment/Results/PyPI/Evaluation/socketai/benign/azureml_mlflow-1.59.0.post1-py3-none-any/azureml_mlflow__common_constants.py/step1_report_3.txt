  "purpose": "Defines a class with constants representing environment variable names for AzureML configuration.",
  "sources": "Constants are assigned string literals representing environment variable names.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external output; no data processing or I/O operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present since only static string assignments are used.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a class with static attributes that hold environment variable names related to Azure Machine Learning configurations. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, and no use of untrusted data sources or sinks. The constants seem to be used for configuration referencing rather than handling sensitive data directly. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of environment variable name constants for AzureML configurations with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
