  "purpose": "Define a class containing environment variable keys related to Azure ML workspace configuration and runtime metadata.",
  "sources": "Class variables that appear to store environment variable names used for Azure ML operations.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or transmitted within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable as there are no input/output operations; only static string assignments.",
  "anomalies": "All variables are static string constants representing environment variable names; no hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class with class variables that hold environment variable names used for Azure Machine Learning configuration. There are no input sources, data processing, or untrusted data flows. The variables are standard identifiers for environment variables and do not pose security risks. The code appears straightforward and intended for configuration purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign configuration class for environment variable keys. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or suspicious activity are present.",
