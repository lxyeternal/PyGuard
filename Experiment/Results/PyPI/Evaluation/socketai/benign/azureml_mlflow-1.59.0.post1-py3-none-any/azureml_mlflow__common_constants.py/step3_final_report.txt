  "purpose": "Defines environment variable keys for Azure ML workflows as static constants.",
  "sources": "Static class attributes representing environment variable names.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static constants used for configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple class with static string constants for environment variable keys. It contains no functions, data processing, or dynamic behavior. No secrets, credentials, or sensitive data are hardcoded. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely configuration, and it does not handle untrusted input or perform network/file operations. All signals indicate benign intent. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. The analysis confirms that the code is a standard configuration class with no security issues or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration class defining environment variable keys for Azure ML. No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk behavior is present. The existing reports and scores are accurate and justified.",
