  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling Azure Machine Learning errors, including serialization and error hierarchy management.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (json, sys, traceback, warnings), and class attributes/methods that handle error data and internal state.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data handling, network activity, or sensitive data exposure observed.",
  "flows": "Error information flows from input parameters to internal attributes, then through serialization methods to produce JSON error reports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs detected. Usage of deprecation warnings indicates legacy support, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes with structured error handling, serialization, and hierarchy management. It includes standard practices for exception handling, logging, and deprecation warnings. No code injection, data leakage, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The focus is on error management within a Python SDK context, with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for an SDK, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and well-structured for error handling purposes.",
