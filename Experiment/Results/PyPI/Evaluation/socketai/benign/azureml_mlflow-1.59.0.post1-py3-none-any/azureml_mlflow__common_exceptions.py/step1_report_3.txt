{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for Azure Machine Learning, enabling detailed error handling and serialization.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries (json, sys, traceback, warnings) and internal AzureML modules. No external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; exception messages and internal data are used internally for error handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted input to sensitive sinks; error messages are constructed from internal variables, no external data influence detected.",
  "anomalies": "Code is mainly class definitions with standard exception handling. No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors. No malicious network or system activities. No dynamic code execution, eval, or suspicious string manipulations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception, with properties and methods for error serialization, printing, and creation from error objects. It uses internal data structures and standard Python features. No input handling from external sources, no dangerous code patterns, and no suspicious side-effects are present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of error handling for AzureML, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for AzureML, with no malicious or malicious-like behavior detected. It focuses on error serialization and internal error management, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
