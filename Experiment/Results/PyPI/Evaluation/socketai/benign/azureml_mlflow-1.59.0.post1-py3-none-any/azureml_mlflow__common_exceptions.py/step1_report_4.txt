{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for Azure Machine Learning errors, including serialization and error hierarchy management.",
  "sources": "Imports standard modules (json, sys, traceback, warnings) and internal Azure ML error modules; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Serialization methods that generate JSON error reports; no untrusted data sinks or external calls are evident.",
  "flows": "Error object creation and serialization flow, primarily within exception handling and JSON formatting functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code. Exception handling includes detailed error info, but nothing appears malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to handle and serialize Azure ML exceptions. It uses standard modules and internal error representations. There are no network calls, data leaks, or hidden backdoors. The code’s logic centers on error message management and JSON serialization without any suspicious or malicious constructs. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of error handling within Azure ML SDK. No anomalies or malicious behavior are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for Azure ML with proper serialization and error hierarchy. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It functions solely to manage and represent error states, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
