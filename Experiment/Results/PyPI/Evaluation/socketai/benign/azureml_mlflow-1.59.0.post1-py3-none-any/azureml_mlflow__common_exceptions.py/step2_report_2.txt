  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the validity of the scoring, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines custom exception classes for AzureML, including serialization and hierarchy management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data, no network activity; error info flows internally.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious constructs. Use of deprecation warnings indicates legacy support.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard SDK error handling, no malicious behavior. Confidence: 1. Malware: 0. Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is a straightforward implementation of exception classes. No issues, no malicious intent. The score of 0 for malware and risk aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining custom exceptions for AzureML.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data sources; error info is internal.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns. Standard exception handling and serialization.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior, standard SDK code. Confidence: 0.9, Malware: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, no signs of malicious activity. The scoring seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, defining exception classes with serialization.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Internal error handling, no external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code. Focused on error management.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent detected. Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero, possibly due to the use of deprecation warnings or error serialization, but not necessarily risky).\n\n**Justification for Risk Score:**  \nThe slight risk score (0.1) may be due to the use of warnings or error serialization, but these are standard practices. No actual vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines exception classes for AzureML, error serialization.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Error info serialization; no external data or network calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious behaviors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard error handling code. No malware or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe score of 0 for malware and risk seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, error handling and serialization.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Internal error info serialization.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard implementation. Malware: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports identify actual code issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All scores are zero, consistent with the analysis. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero in one report (0.1), justified by the use of deprecation warnings and error serialization, which are standard and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, readable, and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured implementation of custom exception classes for AzureML, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis indicates a safe, standard SDK component focused on error handling and serialization, with no security concerns.",
