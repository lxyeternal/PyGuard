{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling and serializing Azure Machine Learning related errors, including error formatting, hierarchy, and deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries (json, sys, traceback, warnings) and a specific AzureML error hierarchy module. Reads input mainly through exception message properties and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Serialization functions (json.dumps) for error information. No direct sink to external systems or network activities. No input handling or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Exception creation and property access flow through the class methods, primarily for error message handling and serialization. No external data flow or untrusted input flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. Code uses warnings for deprecation notices, standard error handling, and JSON serialization. No obfuscation, external network connections, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes for AzureML, focusing on error messaging, hierarchy, and serialization. It imports necessary modules, handles exceptions, and serializes error details to JSON. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The implementation appears standard and secure, primarily concerned with error handling and formatting. No signs of supply chain attacks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception handling for AzureML. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no security risks. It mainly performs error message formatting, serialization, and deprecation warnings. Overall, the code appears safe and trustworthy.",
