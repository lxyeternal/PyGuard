{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Azure Machine Learning errors with serialization and debugging features.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (json, sys, traceback, warnings); error hierarchy modules; class constructors and methods accessing internal attributes.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no use of untrusted inputs directly leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "N/A - no untrusted data flows detected; code primarily manages exception data and serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code mainly involves exception handling and serialization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception, adding attributes and methods for detailed error handling, serialization to JSON, and debugging. No input sources, network operations, or data leaks are present. There are no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code structure is typical for error handling in SDKs, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for Azure ML SDK, focusing on error message management and serialization. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
