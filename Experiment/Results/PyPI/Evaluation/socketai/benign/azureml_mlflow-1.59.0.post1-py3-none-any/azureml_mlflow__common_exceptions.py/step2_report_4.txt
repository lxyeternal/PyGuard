  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the provided code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** Accurately describes the code as defining custom exception classes with serialization, hierarchy, and error management. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=1 (since it's a standard, safe error handling class).\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The high confidence (1) is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The code is safe, and the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard exception class definitions, serialization, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports, no malicious activity or obfuscation. Slightly higher securityRisk (0.1) possibly due to cautious interpretation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely for error handling. The minimal risk score is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores and conclusion are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard exception classes, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identified as safe, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous analyses, no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate and appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports. Code is clear, standard, and readable.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which is reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n### Final System Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0.1 (considering the deprecation warnings and error handling complexity, but overall very low)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of custom exception classes for AzureML SDK. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of recommendations:**  \n- No changes needed; all reports correctly identify the code as safe.  \n- The low risk score reflects the nature of the code, which is primarily error handling logic.\n\n**Final note:** The supply chain security risk here is minimal; the code is a standard SDK component with no malicious intent.",
