  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign SDK client setup for connecting to an API service. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent within this snippet. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of external modules, which should be reviewed separately. Overall, the code is safe and aligns with typical SDK patterns."
