  "purpose": "Define configuration constants and data directory path for a Python application interacting with Salesforce API.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__) which reads the current file's directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is being output or used in a dangerous context.",
  "flows": "Input from __file__ flows into DATA_DIRECTORY path construction.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets other than a client name, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code sets static configuration values for sleep intervals and API versioning. It constructs a data directory path based on the current file location. The only potentially sensitive info is the 'CLIENT_NAME', which is a non-secret identifier. There are no input streams, no data being sent over the network, and no insecure operations detected. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration setup with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It serves to initialize parameters for a larger application, with no indication of malicious behavior.",
