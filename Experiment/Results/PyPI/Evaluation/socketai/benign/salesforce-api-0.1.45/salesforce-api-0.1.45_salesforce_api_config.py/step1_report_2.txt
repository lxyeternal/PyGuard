  "sources": "Reading the filename of the current script using __file__.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink within the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __file__ to construct a data directory path is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets several sleep interval constants, a data directory path based on the script's location, and client/version identifiers. It only involves static value assignments and path construction, with no input/output or dynamic behavior. No signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration setup with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
