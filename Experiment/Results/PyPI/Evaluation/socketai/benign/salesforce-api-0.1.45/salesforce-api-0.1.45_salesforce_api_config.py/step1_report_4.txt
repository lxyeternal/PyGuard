  "purpose": "Define configuration constants and data directory path for a Python application.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__)+ '/data/' (reads the current file's directory path).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks present; no untrusted data is used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; configuration constants are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The directory path construction is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets various timing constants and constructs a data directory path using os.path.dirname(__file__). It also defines static strings for client identification and versioning. There are no dynamic inputs, no external data reads beyond current file path retrieval, and no operations that could be exploited. The code appears to be benign configuration setup without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a straightforward configuration setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
