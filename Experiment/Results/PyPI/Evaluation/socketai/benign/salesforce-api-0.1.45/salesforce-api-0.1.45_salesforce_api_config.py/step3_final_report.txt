  "purpose": "Define configuration constants and construct a data directory path based on the current file location.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ variable to determine the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration values are used.",
  "flows": "Path construction from __file__ to DATA_DIRECTORY; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string concatenation for path building instead of os.path.join, which is non-standard but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets constants for sleep durations and versioning, and constructs a data directory path by concatenating __file__ with a string. No input handling, data leaks, or dynamic code execution are present. The use of string addition for path construction is a minor deviation from best practices but does not introduce security risks. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected. The static nature of the code and absence of external communication or sensitive data suggest a benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration snippet with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor path concatenation issue is a best practice concern but not a security risk. Overall, the code is benign, with negligible security implications.",
