{
  "purpose": "This code manages deployment operations via a SOAP-based web service, including uploading ZIP files, checking deployment status, and cancellation.",
  "sources": "Reads input files for deployment (`input_zip`), reads environment variables or configuration for sleep duration (`config.DEPLOY_SLEEP_SECONDS`).",
  "sinks": "Uses `_post()` method to send data to external SOAP service; potentially exposes ZIP content and process IDs.",
  "flows": "ZIP file content is read and encoded in `_get_zip_content()`; deployment options are serialized to XML; deployment status is checked via process ID; control flow for deployment and cancellation relies on external responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The only data flow involves standard encoding and network communication. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs deployment management through SOAP calls, with input files being read and encoded in base64. It handles responses to determine deployment status, errors, and failure conditions. The only external data handling involves network communication with the SOAP service, which is standard for such integrations. No suspicious or malicious activities such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors are present. Use of external configuration (e.g., `config.DEPLOY_SLEEP_SECONDS`) and reading files are typical. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate deployment management component with no malicious intent detected. It performs standard operations related to deployment via SOAP APIs without suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
