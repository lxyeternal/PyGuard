{
  "purpose": "This code handles deployment processes via a SOAP service, including uploading ZIP files, checking deployment status, and cancellation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as input_zip (file path or file object), async_process_id (string), options (model object), and tick (callable).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is directly used in insecure functions or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input zip file is read and encoded to base64, then sent via _post method; async_process_id used in status checks and cancelation; status info fetched and parsed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution; no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of SOAP-based deployment management. It reads ZIP files, encodes them, and communicates with external services using _post. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual data handling are present. The only input handling involves reading files and process IDs, which are standard for such operations. There are no signs of malicious backdoors, system manipulations, or data leaks. The code structure and flow are typical of a deployment client library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deployment client with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It handles data securely, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity. Overall, it appears safe based on this snippet.",
