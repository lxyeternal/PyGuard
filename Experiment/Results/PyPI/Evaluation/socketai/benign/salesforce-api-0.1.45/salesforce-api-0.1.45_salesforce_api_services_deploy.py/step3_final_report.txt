{
  "purpose": "This code manages deployment operations via SOAP API, including encoding ZIP files, polling deployment status, and cancellation.",
  "sources": "Reads input ZIP files, process IDs for status checks, and external modules for SOAP communication.",
  "sinks": "Encodes files in base64, sends SOAP messages via _post(), retrieves and processes responses.",
  "flows": "File input -> base64 encoding -> SOAP message construction -> network transmission via _post() -> response handling and status updates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected. No unusual code patterns or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard deployment tasks with input validation, encoding, and network communication. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. External dependencies and network interactions are typical for deployment clients. The absence of secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data flows indicates a benign nature. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious sabotage or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deployment utility with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the low security risk score (~0.1) is justified based on its functionality. The assessments across all reports are consistent and accurate.",
