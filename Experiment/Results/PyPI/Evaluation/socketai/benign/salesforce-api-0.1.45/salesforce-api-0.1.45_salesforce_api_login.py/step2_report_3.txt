  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements Salesforce authentication via SOAP, OAuth2, and access tokens.\n- Uses user-provided parameters to build requests.\n- Parses responses for tokens and session info.\n- Contains a print statement in the 'soap' function outputting URLs.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n- Uses standard libraries and practices.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Standard Salesforce auth flows.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** User parameters, HTTP responses.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; minor info leak via print.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns; secure handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, no malicious intent; minor info leak concern.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The print statement is a minor info leak but not malicious. The score of malware=0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Handles Salesforce auth methods.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** User inputs, HTTP responses.\n- **Anomalies:** Print statement in 'soap' function.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; standard request/response handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, minor concern about debug print.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Same as above. The minor info leak is acknowledged, no malware.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Connect to Salesforce via multiple auth methods.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** User inputs, responses.\n- **Anomalies:** Print statement again.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate code, minor debug info leak.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with prior assessments. No malware.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Salesforce auth, multiple methods.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Inputs, HTTP requests, response parsing.\n- **Anomalies:** Print statement.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; standard implementation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, minor info leak.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Same reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Salesforce auth, multiple methods.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** User parameters, responses.\n- **Anomalies:** Print statement.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; standard flows.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, minor debug info leak.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with others.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- **Code presence of print statements** in 'soap' function outputs URLs, which could leak internal URLs in logs but is not malicious.\n- **No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns**.\n- **Response parsing** is standard, with no signs of malicious payloads.\n- **Network activity** is typical for OAuth2 and SOAP authentication.\n\n### Final scoring recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified. No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is appropriate given the minor info leak potential via print statements, but no significant security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0.2**      |\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious intent or payloads detected.  \n- The only concern is minor info leakage via debug print, which is not malicious but should be cleaned up for production.  \n- The code handles sensitive data securely over HTTPS, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, legitimate implementation of Salesforce authentication flows with no malicious or sabotage behavior. The scores provided in the reports are reasonable and consistent with my assessment.",
