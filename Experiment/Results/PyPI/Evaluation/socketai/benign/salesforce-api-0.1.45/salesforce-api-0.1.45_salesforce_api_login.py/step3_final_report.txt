  "purpose": "Provides Salesforce authentication via SOAP, OAuth2, or access tokens, facilitating secure connection setup.",
  "sources": "User input parameters, HTTP responses, response JSON, SOAP response XML.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests, response parsing, response JSON extraction, SOAP message formatting.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to request construction, request to server, server response to response parsing, response to token/session creation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a print statement in 'soap' function outputting URLs, which could leak internal URLs in logs but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Salesforce authentication flows with proper session management. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The print statement in 'soap' function is a minor info leak, not malicious. Response parsing is straightforward, and network interactions are typical for such authentication modules. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious network activity are detected. The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code. The security risk score of 0.2 reflects the minor info leak concern, which is acceptable. Overall, the code appears legitimate and secure, with only a small logging concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Salesforce authentication utility with no malicious intent. The only minor issue is the print statement that could leak URLs; replacing it with proper logging is recommended. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis, indicating a safe and standard implementation.",
