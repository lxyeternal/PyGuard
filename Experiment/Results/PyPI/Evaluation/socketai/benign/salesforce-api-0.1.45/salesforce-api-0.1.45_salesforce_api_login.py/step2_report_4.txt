  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard implementation of Salesforce authentication flows.\n- Common minor concern: the `print(instance_url)` statement in the `soap()` function, which could leak URLs in logs but is not malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic behaviors are detected.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minor concerns about info leaks in logs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain hardcoded credentials or secrets.\n- The `print` statement could leak internal URLs, but this is not malicious—more a logging concern.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The only potential flaw is the `print(instance_url)` in the `soap()` function, which could leak sensitive info in logs.\n- The response parsing for SOAP responses relies on string matching and XML parsing, which is standard but could be fragile if response formats change. However, this is not an error per se.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, justified by no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 seems reasonable, mainly due to the print statement, which is a minor info leak.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as legitimate and secure.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the minor info leak concern.\n- The scores are consistent with the findings; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (minor info leak via print statement)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured Salesforce authentication module. The only minor concern is the debug print statement, which could be removed or replaced with proper logging. There is no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate; no changes needed.",
