{
  "purpose": "The code provides various authentication methods for connecting to a Salesforce service, including OAuth2, SOAP, and token-based authentication.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions (domain, username, password, security_token, client_id, client_secret, access_token, session, api_version), data sent in POST requests, response JSON data.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to external endpoints, parsing response data, potential logging of sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> HTTP requests in oauth2 and soap functions -> Response JSON parsing -> Authentication success/failure logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statement for instance_url (potential information leakage). No evident hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Sensitive data is passed as parameters, not hardcoded. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution. The code does not appear to perform malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard authentication procedures for Salesforce integrations. It makes HTTP requests to external servers with user-supplied data, which is typical for authentication flows. The only potential concern is the print statement that outputs the constructed instance URL, which could leak internal URLs in logs or console outputs. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform any data exfiltration, system modifications, or hidden network activities. Overall, the code appears legitimate and intended for secure authentication operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of Salesforce authentication methods with no malicious intent detected. The only minor concern is the debug print statement, which could be removed to improve security hygiene. No malware or malicious behaviors are present.",
