  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Implements Salesforce authentication methods.\n- **Sources:** User parameters, HTTP responses.\n- **Sinks:** HTTP requests, response parsing.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; print statement in 'soap' could leak URL info but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Standard, secure handling of credentials; no malicious patterns detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure code with minor info leak via print.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard flows.\n- **Anomalies:** Same print statement concern.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent, straightforward implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar again, with emphasis on standard practices.\n- **Anomalies:** Same print statement.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar content, noting potential info leak via print.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same overall assessment.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code?**  \n  None of the reports or the code snippets show signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The print statements, while potentially leaking URLs, are typical debugging artifacts and not malicious.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No obfuscated code or suspicious language features are present.\n\n- **Scores justification:**  \n  The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis. The risk score of 0.2 reflects minor concerns about the print statement, which is acceptable.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  No vulnerabilities are claimed or evident. The code handles credentials over HTTPS, uses session management, and parses responses appropriately.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n  The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly identify the print statement as a minor info leak, not a security breach.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 — minor info leak concern, not a serious security risk.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured Salesforce authentication module with no malicious intent. The minor info leak via print statements should be addressed (e.g., replaced with proper logging), but it does not constitute a security risk. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate.",
