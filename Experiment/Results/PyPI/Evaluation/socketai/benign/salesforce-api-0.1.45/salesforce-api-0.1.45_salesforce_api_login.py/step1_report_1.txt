{
  "purpose": "This code implements various authentication methods for Salesforce API connections, including OAuth2, SOAP, and access token approaches.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters such as domain, username, password, security_token, client_id, client_secret, access_token, and session object; responses from HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to OAuth and SOAP endpoints; potential exposure of sensitive data through response parsing and exception messages.",
  "flows": "User inputs (credentials) are used to construct authentication requests; responses are parsed for tokens and session info; tokens are stored and returned in Connection objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; code structure appears straightforward. The print statement in 'soap' could leak URL info in logs, but this is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code handles credential-based authentication flows securely by sending sensitive data over HTTPS, using session management to reuse HTTP sessions, and parsing responses for tokens. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected. There is no evidence of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The print statement might be considered a minor info leak in logs but not malicious. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution. Overall, it appears to be standard, well-structured authentication code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Salesforce API authentication flows. No malicious or sabotage behavior is detected. It handles credentials and tokens securely, with no suspicious network activity or hidden backdoors. The only minor concern is the print statement that could leak URLs in logs, but this is not malicious.",
