  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code handles Salesforce authentication via SOAP, OAuth2, and access tokens.\n- The sources, sinks, and flows are standard for such an authentication module.\n- The only minor anomaly noted is the presence of a `print(instance_url)` statement in the `soap` function, which could leak URLs in logs but is not malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic behaviors are detected.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.2), which seems reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The only minor flaw is the `print` statement, which could leak URLs but is not malicious.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk justification:** The low scores are justified, given the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 is reasonable, mainly due to the print statement that could leak URLs, but this is minor.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The print statement should be replaced with proper logging or removed to prevent potential information leakage.\n- No other changes are necessary; the code appears legitimate and secure.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (minor info leak via print, but not serious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate; the code is standard, with no malicious intent. The minor info leak concern is acknowledged but not significant enough to raise the risk score beyond 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a legitimate Salesforce authentication utility.\n- No malicious or sabotage behavior detected.\n- The only concern is the print statement, which should be replaced with proper logging.\n- Scores are appropriate and consistent across reports.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.",
