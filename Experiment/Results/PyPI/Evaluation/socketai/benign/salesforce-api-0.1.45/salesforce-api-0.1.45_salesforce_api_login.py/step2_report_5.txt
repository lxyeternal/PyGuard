  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard Salesforce auth via OAuth2, SOAP, or access token.\n- **Sources:** User parameters, HTTP responses.\n- **Sinks:** HTTP requests, response parsing.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; a print statement in `soap()` outputs URLs, which could leak info in logs but is not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** The code performs typical, secure authentication flows over HTTPS. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious code detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, well-structured code. Minor info leak via print statement, but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 (low).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard flows and no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Anomalies:** Same print statement in `soap()`; benign.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above—standard, secure, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar findings: standard Salesforce auth, no hardcoded secrets, benign print statement.\n- **Anomalies:** Print URL, but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: standard, secure, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Anomalies:** Print statement for URL, benign.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous reports: legitimate auth flows, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Anomalies:** Print statement, benign.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior. The code is purely about authentication flows with no signs of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated at 0.2 due to minor info leaks (print statements), but overall low.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The print statements should be replaced with proper logging or removed to prevent info leaks, but this does not constitute malicious activity.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n\n### My estimated scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (minor info leak via print statements, but not a security threat)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of Salesforce authentication flows. No malicious or sabotage behavior is present. The minor info leak via print statements could be improved, but it does not elevate the security risk significantly.",
