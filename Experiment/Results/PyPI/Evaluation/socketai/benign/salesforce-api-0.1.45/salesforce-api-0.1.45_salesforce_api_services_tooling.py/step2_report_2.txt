  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a client wrapper for Salesforce's Tooling API, with methods for executing Apex code, querying, and managing sObjects.\n- Inputs are method parameters and file contents; network requests are made via internal methods (_get, _post, etc.).\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code reads files for executing Apex code, which is standard but could be risky if misused.\n- No suspicious or malicious logic, code injection, or data exfiltration is evident.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No, none of the reports identify actual malicious or vulnerable code; they consistently conclude the code is standard API client code.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The reports do not identify any logical errors or security flaws.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  - Malware scores are 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n  - Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with benign API client code.\n  - Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Points:\n\n- The only potential concern is the `execute_apex_from_file` method, which reads external files and executes their content via `execute_apex`. While this is standard for such clients, if misused, it could execute malicious Apex code. However, the code itself does not contain malicious logic; it simply provides a means to send code for execution.\n\n- The reports correctly identify that this feature could be misused but does not consider it inherently malicious.\n\n- No evidence of code obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Justification of Scores:\n\n- **Malware Score (0):**  \n  Correct, no malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):**  \n  Correct, no obfuscation present.\n\n- **Risk Score (~0.1-0.2):**  \n  Slightly higher due to the `execute_apex_from_file` method, which could be misused to execute malicious code if supplied by an attacker. However, this is a legitimate feature of the API client, and the code itself is not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable in their assessments.\n- No adjustments needed for the scores.\n- The overall security posture of this code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### My Own Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** ~0.15\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward API client with no malicious intent. The only concern is the potential misuse of `execute_apex_from_file`, but this is a legitimate feature and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is secure, with no malware or obfuscation. The minor risk score reflects the potential for misuse but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
