  "purpose": "A client wrapper for Salesforce's Tooling API, enabling execution of Apex code, querying, and sObject management.",
  "sources": "Method parameters, file contents read in execute_apex_from_file",
  "sinks": "Network requests via _get, _post, _patch, _delete; execution of Apex code from files",
  "flows": "Input parameters or file contents -> execute_apex or other methods -> network requests or Apex execution",
  "anomalies": "Use of execute_apex_from_file to run external code; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client for Salesforce's Tooling API, with methods for executing Apex, querying, and managing sObjects. It reads Apex code from files and executes it, which is a legitimate feature but could be misused if malicious code is supplied. No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The network interactions are via internal methods, typical for such clients. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (~0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior. The main concern is the potential misuse of executing arbitrary Apex code, but this is a known feature, not malicious. The code does not contain any logic that indicates malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Salesforce Tooling API client wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated code. The only potential security concern is executing Apex code from external files, which could be misused but is a standard feature. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified, reflecting low risk and no malware. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in secure environments, provided inputs are trusted.",
