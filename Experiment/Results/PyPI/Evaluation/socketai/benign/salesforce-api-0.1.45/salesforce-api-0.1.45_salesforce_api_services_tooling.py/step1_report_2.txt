{
  "purpose": "This code provides a client interface for Salesforce Tooling API resources, enabling actions like executing anonymous Apex code, querying data, and managing SObject records.",
  "sources": "File input in 'execute_apex_from_file' method; parameter inputs in 'completions', 'execute_apex', 'query', 'create', 'get', 'update', and 'delete' methods.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Salesforce API endpoints via '_get', '_post', '_patch', '_delete' methods; data returned from these calls.",
  "flows": "User-provided parameters (e.g., Apex code, SOQL queries, record IDs) are passed into respective methods, then used in network requests to Salesforce API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The file reading in 'execute_apex_from_file' is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes to interact with Salesforce Tooling API endpoints, wrapping HTTP request methods for various operations. It reads input from method parameters and files, sending data via network requests. The 'execute_apex_from_file' method reads a file's content and executes it as Apex anonymously; this is a standard pattern, not malicious. All network calls are straightforward API interactions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code logic are present. The code structure and methods align with typical API client implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard API client wrapper for Salesforce Tooling API functions. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The implementation is straightforward and consistent with legitimate API usage.",
