  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code appears to be a standard API client wrapper for Salesforce's Tooling API.\n- It reads input parameters and files, then makes network requests via methods like `_get`, `_post`, `_patch`, `_delete`.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident.\n- The `execute_apex_from_file` method reads a file and executes its content as Apex code, which is a typical pattern for such clients.\n- No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present.\n\n**2. Logical, Reasoning, or Summary Flaws:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward API wrapper.\n- They acknowledge the potential risks of executing arbitrary Apex code via `execute_apex_from_file`, but note that this is a standard feature, not malicious.\n- No flaws or errors are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Issues:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard API client behavior.\n- These scores seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- No issues warrant a higher risk score. The code is a legitimate API client.\n- The only potential concern is the ability to execute arbitrary Apex code via external input, but this is a known feature of such clients and not inherently malicious.\n- Therefore, risk scores above 0.5 are unjustified.\n\n**5. Malware Score Analysis:**\n- The malware scores are 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- No malicious behavior or code injection is present.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on standard API client behavior.\n- They correctly interpret the `execute_apex_from_file` method as standard, not malicious.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n- No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0.2** (consistent with low security risk, considering the potential misuse of Apex execution but not malicious in itself)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, well-structured Salesforce Tooling API client. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code, nor does it exhibit suspicious behavior. The ability to execute Apex code via files is a known feature but not inherently malicious. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, inherent to API clients with code execution capabilities but not malicious)",
