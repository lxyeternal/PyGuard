{
  "purpose": "This code provides a client interface to Salesforce's Tooling API, allowing execution of queries, Apex code, and management of Salesforce objects.",
  "sources": "Input sources include method parameters such as 'sf_type', 'body', 'file_path', 'query', 'record_id', and 'json' arguments, which are data inputs from external callers.",
  "sinks": "Data sinks include API calls such as self._get, self._post, self._patch, and self._delete, which send data over the network. The execute_apex method reads from files and sends content to the API.",
  "flows": "Potential flows involve reading Apex code from files and sending it via execute_apex, and passing user-provided query strings or JSON data to API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are detected. The code does include file reading for executing Apex code, which could be misused if used maliciously but is standard functionality. No obfuscation or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a client for Salesforce's Tooling API, with methods for querying, executing Apex, and managing Salesforce objects. It reads Apex code from files and sends it for execution. No malicious code or backdoors are evident. Input parameters are directly used in API calls; however, this is typical for such clients. There are no indications of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. The code appears to be standard API client code without any obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an API client for Salesforce Tooling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It safely handles inputs and makes API calls without suspicious modifications or backdoors.",
