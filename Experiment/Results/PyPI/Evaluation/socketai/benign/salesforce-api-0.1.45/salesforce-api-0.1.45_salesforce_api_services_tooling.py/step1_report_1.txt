{
  "purpose": "This code provides a client interface for Salesforce Tooling API, enabling operations such as executing anonymous Apex code, querying data, and managing sObjects.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include method parameters (e.g., body, query, file_path, record_id) and file reads from 'execute_apex_from_file'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests via '_get', '_post', '_patch', '_delete' methods, which send data to external Salesforce services; reading files and executing code may also be sinks depending on usage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters or file input into API request functions, and responses are returned after API calls. File content can flow into 'execute_apex'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are present. The code uses standard patterns for API interaction. No unusual or suspicious code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes to interface with Salesforce Tooling API, with methods for executing Apex code, querying, and managing sObjects. Input parameters are used to construct API requests; files are read for Apex code execution. The code employs standard REST calls with no obfuscation or suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior is apparent. External requests depend on method calls with external inputs, but this is typical for API clients and not inherently malicious. No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code is found.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a straightforward Salesforce API client wrapper with no malicious intent or malicious behavior detected. It appears secure and well-structured for its purpose.",
