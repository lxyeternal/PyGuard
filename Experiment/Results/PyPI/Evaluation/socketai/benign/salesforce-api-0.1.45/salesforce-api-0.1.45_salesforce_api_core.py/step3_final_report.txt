  "purpose": "A class managing HTTP requests with URL normalization and session handling for API communication.",
  "sources": "Input URL parameter in request method, session object initialization.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted URL input normalization, request execution via session methods.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> url_normalize -> session method call (e.g., get, post) -> response.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client utility class. It initializes with optional session management, normalizes URLs before requests, and executes HTTP verbs via the requests library. No dynamic code execution, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. External libraries are standard, and commented-out logging is harmless. The code's structure and behavior are typical for such utilities, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs standard HTTP request handling with URL normalization. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
