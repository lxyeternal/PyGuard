  "purpose": "Provides a class for managing HTTP connections and requests, normalizing URLs and handling sessions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'access_token', 'instance_url', 'session', 'verb', and 'kwargs' containing 'url'.",
  "sinks": "The 'result' object returned from the requests session method, which could contain response data.",
  "flows": "Input data such as 'url' and request parameters flow into the session request method, with URL normalization applied before the request.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No suspicious URL handling or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines a Connection class with an initializer setting up session details, and a request method that normalizes URLs before making HTTP requests. The URL normalization helps prevent URL-based injection or redirection attacks. Commented out logging code is harmless. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution observed. The parameters appear to be controlled inputs, with no evidence of malicious intent or privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an HTTP connection handler with URL normalization. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected, and no signs of security risks or malware. It functions as a legitimate utility for API interactions.",
