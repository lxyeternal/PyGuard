  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs standard HTTP request handling with URL normalization. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
