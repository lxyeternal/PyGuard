  "purpose": "Define a Connection class to make HTTP requests with normalized URLs and session management.",
  "sources": "input parameters: access_token, instance_url, kwargs['url']",
  "sinks": "requests.Session methods (e.g., get, post, put, delete) that send data over the network",
  "flows": "kwargs['url']' -> url_normalize -> session verb method -> network request",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious URL or domain, no obfuscated code or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Connection class that initializes with optional parameters and uses a utility to get a session. The request method normalizes URLs and performs HTTP requests via a session. The commented-out logging does not affect security. No untrusted data flows into insecure sinks beyond standard request handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward implementation of an HTTP client wrapper with URL normalization. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
