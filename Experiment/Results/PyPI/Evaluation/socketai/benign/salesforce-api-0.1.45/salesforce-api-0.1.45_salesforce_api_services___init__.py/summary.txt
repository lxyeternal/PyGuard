  "security_risk": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate safe, straightforward code with appropriate low malware and security risk scores. Report 5's obfuscation and network activity justify higher scores, reflecting potential malicious intent. Minor score adjustments could be made to slightly increase malware suspicion in Report 5, but current scores are reasonable. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the analysis, with no significant discrepancies."
