  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Salesforce errors.\n   - No external input/output, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n   - The code is straightforward and serves as an error handling framework.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely definitional with no malicious behavior.\n   - They appropriately note the absence of data flow, external interactions, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No flaws or logical errors are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0.0\n     - securityRisk: 0.0\n     - obfuscated: 0.0 or 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions for exceptions, there's no basis for higher risk.\n   - The scores of 0.0 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - No malicious activity detected.\n   - The malware score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they only describe the code's static structure.\n   - Their conclusions are justified and conservative.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n**My Own Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, with no supply chain security threats. The reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign appropriate scores. No modifications or escalations are necessary.",
