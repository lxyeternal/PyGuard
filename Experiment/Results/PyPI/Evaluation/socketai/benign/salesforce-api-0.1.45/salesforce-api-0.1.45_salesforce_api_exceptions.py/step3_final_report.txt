  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various Salesforce API errors in a structured manner.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception or SalesforceBaseError; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication; purely class definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or runtime execution beyond class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions related to Salesforce errors. There are no input/output operations, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. The classes inherit from Exception or a base class, serving as structured error categories. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is standard for error handling in Python projects interfacing with Salesforce. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and clarity support the conclusion that it poses no supply chain security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for Salesforce error handling. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No further action or concern is warranted.",
