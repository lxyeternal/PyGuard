  "review": "Let's review the provided reports carefully, step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code solely defines custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception` or a base class `SalesforceBaseError`.\n   - No input/output, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - The classes are straightforward and serve as structured error categories for Salesforce API interactions.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or any signs of malicious intent are detected.\n   - The code does not perform any data handling, external communication, or contain any dynamic or obfuscated constructs.\n   - All reports consistently conclude the code is benign and purely definitional.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - The malware score is 0.0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1.0), reflecting strong agreement on the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Logical Issues in Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they do not overstate or understate the risk.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely definitional and pose no security threat.\n   - No assumptions are made beyond what the code demonstrates.\n\n5. **Scores Justification & Recommendations:**\n   - The scores are reasonable and justified given the evidence.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores reflect the actual risk accurately.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - Based on the class definitions alone, there is no indication of supply chain security issues.\n   - The code is standard for error handling in Python applications interacting with Salesforce.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no supply chain security threat. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, safe set of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior is present.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments necessary.",
