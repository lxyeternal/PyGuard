  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various Salesforce-related errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication within the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as this code only defines exception classes without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious constructs; the code strictly defines exception classes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from Exception, used for error handling. No input/output, network operations, or data processing present. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual patterns. The structure is standard for custom exception hierarchies in Python. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward exception hierarchy for Salesforce error handling with no malicious intent or security risks.",
