  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Salesforce errors. There are no data processing, input/output, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. The classes inherit from the base `Exception` class, serving as structured error categories.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**  \n   None of the reports detect any obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs. The code appears straightforward and standard for exception handling.\n\n3. **Logical Flaws or Errors in the Reports**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly conclude that the code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The analysis aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, correctly indicating no malicious behavior.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential for Changes or Reconsideration**  \n   Since the code is purely definitional and there are no signs of malicious activity, the scores are reasonable and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**  \n   - The code does not include any dynamic or runtime logic that could be exploited.\n   - The exception classes are well-structured and serve their purpose in error handling.\n   - There are no indications of supply chain vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**  \nBased on the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, standard, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code poses no security threat. It is a typical, benign set of exception class definitions for structured error handling in a Salesforce API context.",
