  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Salesforce API error handling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; class definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, outputs, or external interactions; only exception class declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow since no functions or data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of exception class definitions with no unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code declares multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception, organized by error type related to Salesforce operations. There are no inputs, outputs, or logic that could be exploited or used maliciously. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or suspicious code structures are present. The classes are straightforward and serve as error categories, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions for structured error handling in a Salesforce-related application. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks identified.",
