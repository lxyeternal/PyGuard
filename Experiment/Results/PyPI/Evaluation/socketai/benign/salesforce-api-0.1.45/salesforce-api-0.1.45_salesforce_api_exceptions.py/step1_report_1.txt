  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Salesforce-related error handling",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance declarations; no external input or data reading points",
  "targets": "Exception instantiation and handling during runtime; no data sinks in this code",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths present; code only defines classes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no unusual or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from the base Exception class. No input reading, data processing, or external communications are present. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behavior. It appears to be a straightforward setup for structured error handling related to Salesforce API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely definitional for exception handling and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It poses no supply chain security threat.",
