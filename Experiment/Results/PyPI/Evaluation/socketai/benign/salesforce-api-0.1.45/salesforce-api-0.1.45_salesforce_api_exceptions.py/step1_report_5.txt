  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various Salesforce-related errors.",
  "sources": "No input data reading, only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations; solely class inheritance structures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code establishes exception hierarchy.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of class definitions inheriting from Exception, used for error handling in Salesforce integrations. There are no input operations, data processing, or external communications. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The structure appears standard for custom exceptions in Python, with no anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for Salesforce-related errors. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears safe and conventional for its purpose.",
