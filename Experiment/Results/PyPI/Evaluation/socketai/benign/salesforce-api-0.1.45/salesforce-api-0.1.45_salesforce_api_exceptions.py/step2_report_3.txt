  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Salesforce errors.\n   - There are no signs of input reading, data processing, external communications, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is purely definitional, with no malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - **malware:** 0.0\n     - **obfuscated:** 0.0 or 0\n     - **securityRisk:** 0.0\n   - These are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1.0, which is justified based on the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely definitional with no runtime behavior, external inputs, or outputs, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or security flaws exists.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing external code, handling secrets insecurely, or communicating with external servers.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on observable facts—class definitions only.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about hidden behaviors are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The conclusion that the code poses no security threat is justified.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements are present.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:**\n- The code's simplicity and clarity confirm that it poses no supply chain security threat. It is a typical pattern for structured error handling in Python applications interfacing with Salesforce.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The code is safe, with zero risk scores justified.",
