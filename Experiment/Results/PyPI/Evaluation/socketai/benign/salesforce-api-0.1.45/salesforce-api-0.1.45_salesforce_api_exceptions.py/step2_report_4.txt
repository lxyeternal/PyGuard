  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is purely class definitions for custom exceptions related to Salesforce errors.\n- No external input, data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, inheriting from the base Exception class, with no embedded logic.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign and poses no security risk.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The scores assigned for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero in every report.\n- The confidence level is high (1.0) in all reports, indicating strong agreement on the benign nature.\n- No anomalies or inconsistencies are present.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The code is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions, commonly used in Python projects.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as embedded payloads, obfuscated code, or network calls.\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying the code as safe.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0, given the code's clarity.\n- The security risk score should be 0, as the code does not introduce any vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and justified. The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for Salesforce error handling, with no security concerns.",
