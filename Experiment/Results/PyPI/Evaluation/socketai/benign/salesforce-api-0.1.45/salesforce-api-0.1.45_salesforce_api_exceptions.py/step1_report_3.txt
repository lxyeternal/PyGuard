  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific Salesforce-related errors in a Python application.",
  "sources": "None; the code solely defines class declarations without input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as these are only class definitions with no execution or data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "None; code consists only of class declarations inheriting from Exception. No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions for various Salesforce error conditions. It employs inheritance for categorization of exceptions. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or network operations are present. The code structure is clean and typical for exception handling in Python. No signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, intended for structured error handling. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It is safe and typical for its purpose.",
