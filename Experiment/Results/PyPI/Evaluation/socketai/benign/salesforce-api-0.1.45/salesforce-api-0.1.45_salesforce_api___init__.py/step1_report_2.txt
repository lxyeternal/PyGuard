  "purpose": "Import the Client class from the local client module, renaming it as Salesforce, likely for use in Salesforce API integration or similar functionality.",
  "sources": "The local module '.client' from which the Client class is imported.",
  "sinks": "This code itself does not perform any data output, network connections, or data processing that could lead to leaks or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data processing are evident in this single line; it only establishes an import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The dot notation indicates a relative import, common in package structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement bringing in a Client class and renaming it as Salesforce. There are no external inputs, no data flows, no suspicious or malicious behavior evident. It appears to be standard package import syntax without any embedded or hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for Python modules. There is no indication of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply imports a class from a local module.",
