  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- The code is a simple import statement with no data flow, sinks, or anomalies.  \n- The confidence is high (0.9), and all scores (malware, obfuscated, risk) are zero.  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies this as benign. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Same as above, a straightforward relative import with no suspicious activity.  \n- Confidence is 1, all scores zero.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Same analysis: minimal import, no anomalies, no malicious activity.  \n- Confidence 1, scores zero.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Again, a standard import statement, no anomalies or malicious signs.  \n- Confidence 1, scores zero.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Similar import statement, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk score (0.1).  \n- The report states no malicious activity, just a standard import, and the risk score seems to be assigned perhaps due to the import pattern.  \n- **Assessment:** The risk score of 0.1 is marginal and could be justified if the context suggests that importing modules could be risky in certain environments, but based solely on this snippet, it's likely overestimating risk.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking for Malicious or Anomalous Content:\n- All reports confirm that the code is a simple import statement with no embedded malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is also 0, aligning with the simplicity of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- Given the minimal nature of the code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The slight security risk score of 0.1 in report 5 might be an overestimation unless there's external context suggesting that importing modules could be exploited, which isn't indicated here.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent with all reports and the code snippet)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk in a simple import statement)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, with the exception of report 5's slight risk score, which I would consider to be 0 unless further context indicates otherwise.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent.  \n- The malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.  \n- The security risk score should be 0, as the import alone doesn't introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores, but consider lowering the risk score in report 5 to 0 for accuracy unless additional context justifies it.",
