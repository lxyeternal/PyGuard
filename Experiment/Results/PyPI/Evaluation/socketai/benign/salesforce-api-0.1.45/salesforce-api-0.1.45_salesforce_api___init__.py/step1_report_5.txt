  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow present in the code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement with no visible anomalies or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a single import statement, importing the Client class from a local module named client. There are no functions, data processing, or external network calls. Without additional context, this appears to be a standard module import typical in Python projects. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. Since the code is minimal, no malicious intent or security issues can be inferred from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a larger module that uses the Salesforce class for API interactions.",
