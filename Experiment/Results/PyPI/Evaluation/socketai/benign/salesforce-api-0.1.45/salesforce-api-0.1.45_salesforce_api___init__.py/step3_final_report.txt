{
  "purpose": "The code imports a class 'Client' from a local module '.client' and assigns it an alias 'Salesforce'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external input or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs a static import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import of a class with an alias, typical in Python modules. It involves no data processing, network activity, or external inputs. The import statement is standard and benign. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The minimal nature of the code suggests a low security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate. The slight elevation of risk to 0.1 in one report appears unjustified given the benign context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The security risk score should be set to 0 across all assessments, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly zero. The overall assessment indicates no malicious or security threat from this code snippet.",
