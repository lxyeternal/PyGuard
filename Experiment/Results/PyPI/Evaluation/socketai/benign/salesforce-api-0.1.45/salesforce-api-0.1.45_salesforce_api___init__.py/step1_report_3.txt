  "purpose": "This code imports the 'Client' class from a local module named 'client' and aliases it as 'Salesforce'. Its purpose appears to be setting up a class alias for further use in the program.",
  "sources": "The code reads only from the local module '.client' for the class 'Client'. No external input or data is read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or other effects in this specific code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present in this snippet beyond the import statement, which is a static code operation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal and standard. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a local module and creates an alias for it. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security issues. As it is only an import statement with an alias, it does not perform any operations or contain any malicious code. No external data is read, no untrusted input is processed, and no harmful actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and standard. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
