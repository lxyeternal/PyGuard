  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'salesforce-api', primarily to gather data files and configure package installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads the list of data files in 'salesforce_api/data' directory using os.walk and glob; reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are evident; the code writes to package data and reads local files only.",
  "flows": "Reads directory contents to build data_files list; reads 'README.md' content for long_description during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed. No user input processing or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that prepares package data and metadata for distribution. It walks the filesystem to gather data files, which is standard. It reads a local README file to include a description, which is normal. There are no suspicious code behaviors, such as dynamic code execution, network activity, or secret handling. All functions and imports are standard for a setup script. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It performs typical tasks without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
