{
  "purpose": "This script is for setting up a Python package named 'salesforce-api', including collecting data files and defining package metadata for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data files from the 'salesforce_api/data' directory using os.walk and glob; it also reads the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function writes package metadata and configuration, but does not process untrusted data inputs beyond local file reading.",
  "flows": "Data files collected from the filesystem are passed directly into the package_data parameter of setup(), with no external or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. The code performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup routine using setuptools. It constructs a list of data files from a specified directory, then passes that list into the setup() function. It reads a README file for description, which is common practice. There are no signs of code injection, data leaks, or malicious activity. All operations are confined to filesystem reading and package configuration. No external data, network connections, or sensitive data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious activity.",
