{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python library, collecting data files from a local directory and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Filesystem traversal in 'salesforce_api/data' directory, reading 'README.md' for long description",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no network operations, no dynamic code execution",
  "flows": "Filesystem reading to package data, static metadata assignment to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward filesystem operations and static configuration",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory traversal to gather data files, reads a README for description, and calls setuptools.setup() with static parameters. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The logic is standard for Python packaging scripts, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration with no malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores should be 0, and the security risk score should also be 0, reflecting the code's safety.",
