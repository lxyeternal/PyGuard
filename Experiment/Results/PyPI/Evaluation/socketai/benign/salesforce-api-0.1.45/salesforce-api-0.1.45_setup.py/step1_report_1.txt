  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library 'salesforce-api' including inventorying data files.",
  "sources": "Reads files from the 'salesforce_api/data' directory to include in package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no external data output or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Data files inventory flows from directory walk to package data assignment; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard setup script with no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup: it collects data files from a specified directory, then calls setuptools.setup() with package details and dependencies. There are no user input reads, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The inventory function processes directory contents in a straightforward manner. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security issues.",
