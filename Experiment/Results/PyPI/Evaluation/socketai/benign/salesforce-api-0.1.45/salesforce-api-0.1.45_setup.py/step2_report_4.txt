  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the technical details, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious activity, no anomalies, standard setup script.\n- **Code review:** The code performs directory traversal, collects data files, and calls `setup()`. No network, user input, or dynamic code execution.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0, confidence=1.0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.  \n- The security risk is correctly low.  \n- The malware score is appropriate at 0.  \n- The confidence is justified at 1.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard setup routine, no suspicious activity.\n- **Code review:** Same as above; filesystem reading, no external or untrusted data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Consistent with previous, no issues.  \n- The security risk remains negligible.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard setup script, no malicious activity, minimal security risk.\n- **Code review:** Same pattern; no external data processing, no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly noted at 0.1, perhaps due to cautiousness, but no real vulnerability.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The small security risk score (0.1) is acceptable given the minimal potential for issues, but since there's no actual vulnerability, it could be set to 0 for consistency.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- I suggest lowering `securityRisk` to 0.0 for consistency with other reports, unless there's a reason to be cautious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard setup, no malicious behavior.\n- **Code review:** No anomalies, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Fully aligned with expectations.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Code review:** Same as others; filesystem access, no dynamic code, no external data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The malware scores are all zero, consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, as expected.\n- The security risk scores are mostly zero; only report 3 has a 0.1, which I recommend lowering to 0 for consistency, as there's no actual vulnerability.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All should remain at 0.0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All at 0.0.\n- **Security risk:** Set to 0.0 across all reports for consistency, unless there's an explicit reason to be cautious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk | Confidence | Notes |\n|---------|---------|--------------|----------------|------------|--------|\n| 1       | 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.0            | 1.0        | No issues |\n| 2       | 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.0            | 1.0        | No issues |\n| 3       | 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.0            | 1.0        | Lower securityRisk from 0.1 to 0.0 |\n| 4       | 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.0            | 1.0        | No issues |\n| 5       | 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.0            | 1.0        | No issues |\n\n---\n\n**Final overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\nThe code is benign, standard packaging code with no security concerns.",
