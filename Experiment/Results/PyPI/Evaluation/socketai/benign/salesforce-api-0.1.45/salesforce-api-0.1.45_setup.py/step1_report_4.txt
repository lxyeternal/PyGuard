  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'salesforce-api', including inventorying data files and configuring package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads data files from 'salesforce_api/data' directory; reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The data_files_inventory function collects file paths for packaging; no user input or untrusted data flow is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup.py pattern; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function to gather data files from a specific directory, then configures the package setup with metadata and dependencies. It uses standard libraries and practices without any dynamic code execution or malicious patterns. No external or untrusted data sources are processed at runtime; the code is straightforward and adheres to typical packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs standard packaging tasks without any security risks.",
