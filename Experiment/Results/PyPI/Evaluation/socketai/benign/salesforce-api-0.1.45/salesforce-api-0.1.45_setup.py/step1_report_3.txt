{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package called 'salesforce-api', used to package and distribute the Salesforce API wrapper.",
  "sources": "The code reads the list of data files from the 'salesforce_api/data' directory, specifically via os.walk and glob functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any apparent sinks that process untrusted data; it primarily handles file enumeration and package setup.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs; the only data handling involves reading files from a local directory and passing static package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior indicators are present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools methods to configure package metadata, dependencies, and data files. The data_files_inventory function enumerates files within a local directory and prepares them for packaging, which is a common practice in Python package setup scripts. There are no user inputs, external data sources, or runtime code execution that could be exploited. All code appears to be straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical setup script for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It safely enumerates data files and configures package metadata. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
