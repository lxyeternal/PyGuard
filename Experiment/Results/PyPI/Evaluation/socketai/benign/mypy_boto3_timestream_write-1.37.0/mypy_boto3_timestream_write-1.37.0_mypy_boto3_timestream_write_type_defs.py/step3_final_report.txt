  "purpose": "Type annotations for timestream-write service type definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys.version_info checks, and type definitions (TypedDicts, Literals).",
  "sinks": "None; static type definitions only.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; purely static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard practice with conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports based on Python version. There are no executable statements, external data handling, or runtime logic. The purpose is to provide type hints for static analysis and IDE support. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as static type annotations for the AWS Timestream SDK. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
