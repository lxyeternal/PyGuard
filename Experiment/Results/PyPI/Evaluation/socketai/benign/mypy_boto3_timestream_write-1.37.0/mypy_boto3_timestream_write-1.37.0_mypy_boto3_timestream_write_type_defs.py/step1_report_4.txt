{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for the timestream-write service, used for data modeling and API request/response schemas.",
  "sources": "Constant imports, sys.version_info checks for conditional imports, and the module's own type alias and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted input or output handling, no data leaks, and no external calls or system interactions.",
  "flows": "The code defines data structures without executable logic or data flows that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions, mostly structured as TypedDicts, for the timestream-write SDK. It conditionally imports modules based on Python version to ensure compatibility. All data types appear to be schema definitions with no executable code, external data handling, or network interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as hidden backdoors, code injections, or data exfiltration routines. The use of 'NotRequired' and 'Literal' types aligns with standard schema modeling. Overall, the code is safe and intended solely for static type hinting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, schema-focused Python module for type annotations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard practices for backward compatibility and type safety. No malware or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
