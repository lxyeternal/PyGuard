  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for the timestream-write service API, including request/response formats and configuration types.",
  "sources": "None (pure type definitions and static annotations, no runtime data input).",
  "sinks": "None (no data processing or output; purely type definitions).",
  "flows": "N/A (no runtime data flow; static type annotations only).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code activities; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type definitions using Python's TypedDict, Union, and Literal to specify data structures for the AWS Timestream Write API. It includes conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions but does not perform any data processing, network communication, or code execution. No runtime input/output, external command calls, or dynamic code execution mechanisms are present. The code appears to be standard and well-structured type annotations for API interaction, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static type definitions for the AWS Timestream Write SDK, with no runtime logic or suspicious activities. It is safe, with no malicious intent detected.",
