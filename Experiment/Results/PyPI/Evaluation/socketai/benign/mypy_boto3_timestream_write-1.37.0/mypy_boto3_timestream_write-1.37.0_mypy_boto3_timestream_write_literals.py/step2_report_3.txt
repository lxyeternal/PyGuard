  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, logical consistency, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines static string literals for AWS Timestream write service and other AWS resource types. No dynamic data or external input involved.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or external output; purely static type annotations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies; standard static definitions. Uses conditional import for Python version compatibility, which is common.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a straightforward type hints module, safe, and free of malicious elements.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is static, safe, and intended solely for type annotations. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining string literal types for AWS services and resource identifiers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data handling or external data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies; static, declarative code. Uses conditional import for `Literal`.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is benign, purely for type safety, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis aligns with the code's nature. No concerns or inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines literals for AWS Timestream write service and related identifiers, with version check for `Literal`.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow; static definitions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies; standard pattern for type hinting modules.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, static, and intended for type annotations.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate and consistent with the code content. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, with detailed documentation and example usage.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime logic; purely static.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies; standard static type definitions with conditional import.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, safe, and typical for SDK type hints.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrectly identifies the code as a standard, safe type definition module.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines AWS resource and service string literals, with a version check.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; large static lists are common in SDK type definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious behavior; purely static.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports identify any issues with the code. All recognize it as static, benign type definitions for AWS SDKs.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.\n- **Security Risks:** No security risks are present; the code contains no runtime logic, external data, or secrets.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — purely static type definitions with no security implications.\n\n**Additional Notes:**  \nThe code is a standard type hints module for AWS SDKs, intended to improve type safety and developer experience. It employs common patterns like conditional imports for compatibility. No suspicious or malicious elements are present.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, static, and serves solely as a type annotation aid. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
