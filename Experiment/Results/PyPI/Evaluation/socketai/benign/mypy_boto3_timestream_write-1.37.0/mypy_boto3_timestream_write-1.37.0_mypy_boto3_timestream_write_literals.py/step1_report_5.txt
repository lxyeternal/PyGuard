  "purpose": "Define type literals for the timestream-write service and related AWS service constants for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Importing sys module for version check; defining string literals for various AWS resource and service types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks that could leak data or cause effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external inputs to sensitive functions; the code purely defines type literals.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a large static list of string literals representing AWS service names, regions, and resource types. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward type definition module utilizing Python's Literal types for AWS resource identifiers. It performs a version check for importing 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' without any complex logic. No external input handling, network activity, or code execution present. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs identified. The large static data lists are typical for SDK type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, structured type definition module for AWS service constants, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
