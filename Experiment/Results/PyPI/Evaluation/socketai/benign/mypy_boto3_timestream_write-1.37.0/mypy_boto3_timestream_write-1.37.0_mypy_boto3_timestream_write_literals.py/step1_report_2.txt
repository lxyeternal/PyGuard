{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS Timestream write service and general AWS service identifiers used for type annotations in Python code.",
  "sources": "Read-only string literals defining valid values for different AWS resource types, statuses, and service names.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform data output, external calls, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only defines constants and type aliases without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code strictly contains static type definitions, no dynamic or executable logic, no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code uses conditional import for 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version. It defines a series of string literal types as constants for use in type annotations, ensuring type safety for AWS resource identifiers and statuses. There are no functions, external inputs, or outputs; the entire script serves as a type definitions module. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a standard, static type alias setup for a Python SDK or type checking context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static type definition module used to provide type hints for AWS Timestream write service and related AWS resource types. It contains no executable or malicious code, no data handling, and no security risks. It is purely for type safety and documentation purposes.",
