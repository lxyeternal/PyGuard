  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS Timestream write service and various AWS services, regions, and resource names for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals assigned to type aliases; no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data; the code is solely defining constants for type hints.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors. Usage of conditional import for compatibility is standard. No obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type aliasing using Python's Literal for various AWS service names, resource names, regions, and other string-based types. It uses conditional import to maintain compatibility across Python versions. All content is static and intended for type annotations, with no runtime logic, input handling, or external data processing. The overall structure and content are consistent with standard type hinting modules, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type definitions module for AWS SDK typings, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It appears to be safe and intended solely for type hinting purposes.",
