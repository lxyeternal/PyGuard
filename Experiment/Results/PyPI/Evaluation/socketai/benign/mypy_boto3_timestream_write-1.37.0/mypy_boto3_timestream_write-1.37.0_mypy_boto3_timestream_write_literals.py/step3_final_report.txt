  "purpose": "Defines static string literals for AWS service names, resource types, regions, and statuses used for type annotations and static analysis.",
  "sources": "Static string literals assigned to type aliases; no external data or input handling.",
  "sinks": "No data flow or external output; purely static definitions.",
  "flows": "None; static declarations only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard static type alias definitions with conditional import for Python version compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static module providing string literal types for AWS SDK typings. It employs common practices such as conditional imports for compatibility and contains no runtime logic, external data handling, or obfuscated/malicious code. The purpose is to enhance type safety and documentation. No secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. All signals indicate benign static definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static set of type alias definitions for AWS resource identifiers, regions, and statuses. It serves as a type hinting aid with no malicious intent or security risks. The provided reports correctly assess the code as benign with malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. No modifications are necessary.",
