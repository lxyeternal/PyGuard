  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS Timestream write service and various AWS service identifiers for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions for conditional type definitions, literals for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code only defines type aliases and literals.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors; the code is purely declarative with no runtime logic or data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines multiple type aliasing literals for various AWS resource identifiers and service types. It includes a large set of literal strings for different AWS services and regions. There are no data input, output, or runtime behaviors, and no dynamic code execution, external calls, or data leaks present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static type definition module with no malicious intent. It simply declares type aliases for AWS resource and service identifiers, serving as a type annotation aid. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious activities are detected.",
