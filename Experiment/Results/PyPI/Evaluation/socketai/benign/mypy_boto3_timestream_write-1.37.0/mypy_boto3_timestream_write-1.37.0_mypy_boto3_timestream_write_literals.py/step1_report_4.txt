{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS Timestream write service literals and related AWS service identifiers.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module for version checking, type annotations from typing or typing_extensions, and literal definitions for various AWS-related string types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code solely defines constants and type annotations without data processing or I/O.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not include data flow or runtime logic, only type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is purely declarative, defining string literal types and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a docstring explaining its purpose and usage, including a link to documentation and example usage. It conditionally imports Literal based on Python version, which is a common pattern. All the literal types are statically defined as string literals representing AWS service names, regions, and resource types. There are no dynamic operations, input/output, or execution logic. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard type declaration module intended to provide strict string literals for AWS service identifiers and other constants. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks.",
