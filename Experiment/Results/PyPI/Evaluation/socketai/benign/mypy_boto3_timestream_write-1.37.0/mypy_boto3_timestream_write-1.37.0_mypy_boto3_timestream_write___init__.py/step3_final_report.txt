  "purpose": "Provides a simple interface for the timestream-write service by importing and exporting the TimestreamWriteClient class.",
  "sources": "Imports TimestreamWriteClient from a local module (.client).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import of TimestreamWriteClient; assignment to Client; export via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025), which is likely a placeholder or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports a class from a local module and re-exports it, with a documentation string providing usage instructions. There are no data flows involving untrusted input, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious behavior detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module interface with no malicious features or security vulnerabilities. The minor anomaly (future date) is non-critical. Overall, the code poses no security risk.",
