  "purpose": "Define the package version as a static string.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code is a static assignment of a version string.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment with no external data or dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual future copyright year (2025), but not malicious or suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward version declaration with no input handling, external calls, or dynamic behavior. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is benign. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign appropriate scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
