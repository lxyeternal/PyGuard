  "anomalies": "Minimal code; only a version string assignment with a copyright notice. No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and includes a copyright statement. It does not perform any input/output operations, network activity, or execute dynamic code. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious payloads, or obfuscated constructs. The content appears to be standard version declaration typical for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration with a copyright statement. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
