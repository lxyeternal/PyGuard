  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__` with a copyright notice.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The code is minimal and standard for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or inaccuracies are evident.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1.0 or 0.9), which is reasonable given the simplicity.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any potential risk that warrants a higher score.\n   - The code is static, with no external dependencies or dynamic behavior.\n   - Therefore, the risk scores are justified at 0.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code contains only a version string and a copyright notice.\n   - No malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward, static code analysis.\n   - No assumptions about hidden behavior are made.\n   - The assessments are sound.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — No security risks identified.\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThis code is a standard, benign version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.\n\n**If I were to assign my own scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThe code is perfectly benign and typical for package versioning.",
