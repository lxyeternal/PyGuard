  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Logic**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - No input sources, data sinks, or data flows are present.\n   - The code is minimal, containing only a copyright comment and a variable assignment.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and without malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The only minor point is the future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not harmful or suspicious.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n   - No report suggests any reason to increase risk or malware scores.\n\n4. **Potential Malicious or Vulnerable Aspects**:\n   - Since the code is a static version string, it cannot be malicious.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are justified based on this code snippet.\n   - The only unusual aspect is the future year in the copyright, but that’s not malicious.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Overall assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, benign version declaration.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0.0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score**: 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note**:\nThis code snippet is a textbook example of a harmless version declaration. No further action is necessary.",
