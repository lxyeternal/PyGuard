  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple, static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No external inputs, data flows, or complex logic are present.\n- The code is minimal, standard practice for package versioning.\n- The only unusual aspect is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data flow.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Any errors in the reports?**  \n  No. The analysis is accurate. The only minor point is the future copyright year, which is noted as unusual but not harmful.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is correct. The code does not exhibit any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0.0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Reasoning about scores higher than 0.5:\n- None of the reports justify higher scores. The code is trivial and safe.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; all analyses correctly conclude benign intent.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (correct)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The only noteworthy point is the future copyright year (2025). While unconventional, it doesn't introduce any security concern.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security issues. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nNo further action needed.",
