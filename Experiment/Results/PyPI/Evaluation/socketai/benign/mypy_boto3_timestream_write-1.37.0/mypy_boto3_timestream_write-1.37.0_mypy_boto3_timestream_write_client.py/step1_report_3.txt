  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for interacting with AWS Timestream Write service, including method definitions for various operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sys, botocore, and internal type definitions; class property and method signatures; unpacks of request type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted input via method **kwargs parameters; use of generate_presigned_url which can generate URLs with embedded parameters.",
  "flows": "Unpack of request parameters in method calls, potentially handling untrusted data; generate_presigned_url generating URLs possibly influenced by input; tagging and resource operations that may include resource identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; no unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or hidden behavior detected. Use of docstrings and type hints consistent with standard SDK wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SDK stub for the AWS Timestream Write client, defining type annotations, method signatures, and exceptions. It uses 'Unpack' for flexible request parameter handling, which is standard in such stubs. No code executes external commands, network operations, or contains embedded malicious logic. The generate_presigned_url method accepts parameters that could potentially be manipulated, but this is typical for SDK functions. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured interface with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard SDK interface for AWS Timestream Write service, primarily consisting of method signatures, type annotations, and exception definitions. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of 'Unpack' for request parameters is normal in type stubs. No suspicious or malicious code detected.",
