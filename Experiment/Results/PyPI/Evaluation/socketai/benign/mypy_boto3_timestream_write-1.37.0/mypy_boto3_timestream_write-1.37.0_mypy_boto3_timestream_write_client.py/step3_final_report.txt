  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the boto3 Timestream Write service, serving as a structured SDK wrapper with documented method signatures and type hints.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.version_info checks, type definitions, and method signatures with kwargs unpacking.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters (kwargs), generate_presigned_url, and resource/tag operations that interface with external AWS services and potentially untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Kwargs unpacked into request type definitions, used in API calls, and return response types; generate_presigned_url generates URLs based on input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected. Use of standard SDK features like generate_presigned_url and kwargs unpacking is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, type-annotated SDK wrapper for AWS Timestream Write, with method signatures referencing external documentation. No runtime logic, data manipulation, or obfuscation is present. The potential for misuse exists in features like generate_presigned_url, but this is inherent to AWS SDKs and not indicative of malicious intent. The code's structure and content are consistent with autogenerated or manually maintained SDK interfaces, with no signs of malicious behavior or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK interface with no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate given its purpose and content.",
