  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the Python library 'mypy-boto3-timestream-write'.",
  "sources": "Reads static README.md file; imports from pathlib and setuptools; static metadata in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network calls, or dynamic code execution; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Static data from README.md and hardcoded metadata used directly in setup() without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and adheres to standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py for Python packaging, with no dynamic or malicious code. It reads a static README.md file for description, imports standard libraries, and calls setup() with fixed metadata. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. The code performs only package configuration tasks, with no external or untrusted data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
