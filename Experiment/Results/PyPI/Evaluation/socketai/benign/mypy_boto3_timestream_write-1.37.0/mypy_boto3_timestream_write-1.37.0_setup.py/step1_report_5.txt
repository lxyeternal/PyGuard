  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python library, specifically for mypy-boto3-timestream-write.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; reads package metadata and dependencies directly from the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data or user inputs are processed or executed.",
  "flows": "N/A - The script loads static data and calls setup() with predefined parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected; the code is straightforward and typical of a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a local README.md for documentation, and invokes setuptools.setup() with static package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The script serves a standard purpose in package distribution without any signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as expected for packaging purposes.",
