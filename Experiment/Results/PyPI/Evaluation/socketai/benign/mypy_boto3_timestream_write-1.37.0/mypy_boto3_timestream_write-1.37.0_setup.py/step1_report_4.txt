{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Path(__file__).parent / \"README.md\" for reading the long description; static string inputs for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "Read from the README file to assign to LONG_DESCRIPTION; then use static values for setup configuration; no data flows from external untrusted sources to critical points.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated segments, or suspicious constructs. The code performs standard package setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path and setuptools, reads a local README file for long description, and calls setup() with static package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code adheres to standard Python packaging conventions without suspicious patterns or embedded malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a typical Python package configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only contains standard package metadata and setup instructions.",
