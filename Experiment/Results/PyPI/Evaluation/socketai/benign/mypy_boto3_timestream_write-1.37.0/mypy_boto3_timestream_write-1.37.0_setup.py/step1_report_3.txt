  "flows": "N/A — the script primarily reads static files and defines package setup parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or network activities.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads static files, and defines package configuration with static metadata. It does not perform any data processing, user input handling, or external communications. All code is standard for a setup script. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies.",
