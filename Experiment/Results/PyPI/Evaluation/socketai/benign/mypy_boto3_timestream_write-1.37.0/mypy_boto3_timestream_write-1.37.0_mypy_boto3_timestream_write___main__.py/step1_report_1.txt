  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the package, including version details and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv, writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout, which could be viewed or redirected by users.",
  "flows": "Reads sys.argv for '--version', then calls print_version or print_info to output data to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI entrypoint that outputs package information and version details. It reads input from sys.argv and writes to stdout. There are no external data sources, no user input processing beyond argument checking, and no interaction with system files or network. The code is simple, well-structured, and intended solely for informational purposes. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious code segments were identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script that outputs package info and version. It shows no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for a command-line utility.",
