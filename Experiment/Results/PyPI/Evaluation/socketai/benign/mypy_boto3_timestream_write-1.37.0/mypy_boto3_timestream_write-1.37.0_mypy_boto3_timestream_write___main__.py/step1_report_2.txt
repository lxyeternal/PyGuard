  "purpose": "CLI entrypoint for printing package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output, reading from sys.argv",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, call print_version() and output version; otherwise, call print_info() and output package info",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious function calls, straightforward behavior, no obfuscation or dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a simple CLI tool that prints package info or version based on command-line arguments. It uses standard library functions with no external data sources or untrusted input processing beyond basic argument checking. No data leaks, no external network calls, and no suspicious code structures are present. The code appears benign, serving solely informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It merely outputs predefined package details based on user input. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or security issues detected.",
