  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",

  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info() outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns detected. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious system commands.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a simple command-line interface, printing static information about the package and its version. It reads input solely from sys.argv and outputs via sys.stdout, with no external data fetching, network activity, or untrusted input processing. The code is straightforward, with clear, purpose-driven functions, and lacks any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving a simple informational purpose. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are evident in this module.",
