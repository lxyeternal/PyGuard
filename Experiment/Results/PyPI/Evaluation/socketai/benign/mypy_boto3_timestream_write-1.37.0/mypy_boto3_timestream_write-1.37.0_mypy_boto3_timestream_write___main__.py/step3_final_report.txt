  "purpose": "CLI utility that outputs package info or version based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input; static strings for output",
  "sinks": "stdout.write for displaying info",
  "flows": "Input argument check -> output static info or version",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and static",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI script that prints static package info or version depending on '--version' argument. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle untrusted input beyond argument presence. No secrets, credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code's behavior is benign, with all outputs hardcoded. The code structure is minimal, and no suspicious operations are detected. The security risk is negligible, and malware likelihood is zero. The only minor overestimation in some reports is the securityRisk score of 0.1, which should be adjusted to 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, static, and performs a straightforward informational task. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature; minor adjustments to the security risk score in some reports are recommended for accuracy.",
