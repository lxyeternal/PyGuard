{
  "purpose": "This code benchmarks deduplication methods using MinHash techniques on a SQL dataset, comparing performance and deduplication effectiveness.",
  "sources": "Dataset loaded via 'load_dataset'; no user input or external data sources directly accessed within the functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is being written to files, network, or external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading to hashing functions, then to set membership checks for deduplication, with no external output beyond console printing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a public dataset, applies MinHash-based deduplication using two different implementations, and compares their performance and results. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no handling of sensitive data observed. The code appears to be a standard benchmarking tool without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a benchmarking script for deduplication techniques on publicly available datasets. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified.",
