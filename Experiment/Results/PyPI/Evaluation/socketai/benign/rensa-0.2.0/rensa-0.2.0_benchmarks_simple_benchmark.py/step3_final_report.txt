  "purpose": "Benchmark deduplication performance using MinHash and RMinHash on a synthetic SQL dataset.",
  "sources": "Loading dataset from 'gretelai/synthetic_text_to_sql' via load_dataset; reading 'sql' field from each dataset example.",
  "sinks": "No external data output, network activity, or file writing; all processing is in-memory and console output.",
  "flows": "Dataset loaded -> hashed with MinHash/RMinHash -> hashes stored in set -> deduplication based on hash comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of open-source libraries and standard data processing techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a public dataset, applies standard MinHash and RMinHash algorithms for deduplication, and measures performance. It performs in-memory operations without network activity or data exfiltration. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The logic is clear, and the functions use well-known libraries. The dataset source is legitimate, and the code does not handle untrusted user input beyond dataset loading. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign benchmarking utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
