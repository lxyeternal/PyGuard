  "purpose": "This script benchmarks deduplication methods (MinHash variants) on a dataset of SQL queries for performance and accuracy comparison.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset from 'gretelai/synthetic_text_to_sql' via load_dataset; reads dataset examples' 'sql' field.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is written or transmitted; no sensitive data is leaked or exfiltrated; no insecure operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from dataset -> processed through hash functions (MinHash, RMinHash) -> stored in sets for deduplication -> results computed and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures observed. Usage of external libraries appears legitimate for deduplication tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and dedicated packages for dataset loading and MinHash computations. Functions create MinHash objects, update them with text, and store their digest representations for deduplication. The main process loads a dataset, runs deduplication benchmarks with two different hash functions, and outputs timing and comparison metrics. No external network connections, no data exfiltration, nor malicious code patterns are present. The logic is straightforward, focusing on performance measurement of deduplication methods. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs benign benchmarking of deduplication algorithms on a publicly available dataset. No malicious or suspicious activity observed. It is safe and intended for performance evaluation purposes.",
