  "purpose": "Benchmarking MinHash implementations for deduplication performance and correctness using a synthetic dataset.",
  "sources": "Dataset loading via load_dataset; input texts for MinHash functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Dataset entries fed into MinHash functions; digests stored in sets for deduplication; performance metrics collected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a dataset, applies two MinHash functions, deduplicates based on their digests, measures execution time and memory, profiles functions, and checks correctness via Jaccard similarity. All operations are standard benchmarking procedures. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward and uses well-known libraries for legitimate purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign benchmarking tool for MinHash algorithms with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate safe, standard performance evaluation code.",
