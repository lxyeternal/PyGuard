{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to generate filesystem paths for themes, logos, and PDFs based on the script's location (__file__). It facilitates locating static resources for documentation builds.",
  "sources": "The functions read the __file__ variable to determine the current script's directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; the code only constructs paths locally.",
  "flows": "The code constructs paths from the package directory (__file__) to specific resource subdirectories or files, with no external data flow or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, static, and uses standard library functions without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple utility functions to generate resource paths based on the script's location. It uses os.path functions with fixed or default parameters, with no external input, network activity, or dynamic execution. The functions serve static resource management purposes, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The consistent reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all appropriate given the code's functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for filesystem path management in documentation build processes. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
