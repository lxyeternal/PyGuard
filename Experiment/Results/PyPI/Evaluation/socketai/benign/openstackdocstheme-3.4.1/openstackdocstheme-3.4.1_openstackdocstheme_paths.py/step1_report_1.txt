  "purpose": "Provide filesystem paths for themes and logos used in local build processes for documentation.",
  "sources": "os.path functions and the __file__ variable, which are used to determine current script directory and generate paths.",
  "sinks": "Path generation functions that output directory paths; no untrusted input is processed or stored.",
  "flows": "os.path functions read the script's location (__file__) -> path functions generate and return specific directory paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets observed. All functions perform straightforward path concatenations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os.path to generate directory paths relative to its own location (__file__). Multiple functions return theme and logo directories or files based on fixed arguments or default parameters. The get_openstack_logo_path() function is a simple wrapper for compatibility, returning a theme logo path. There is no dynamic or untrusted input involved, no network activity, or suspicious code. Overall, this appears to be standard utility code for locating resource files for documentation builds.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for generating resource file paths within a package. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are present.",
