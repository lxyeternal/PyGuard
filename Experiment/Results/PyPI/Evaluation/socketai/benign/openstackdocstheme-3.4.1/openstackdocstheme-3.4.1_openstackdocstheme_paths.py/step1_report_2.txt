  "purpose": "Provides file path utilities for theme and logo resources in local builds.",
  "sources": "None; code does not read external input or untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "None; code constructs file paths internally without executing external commands or handling untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks since no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Functions are straightforward and only manipulate file paths.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to generate directory paths for themes, logos, and PDFs based on the package directory. It uses standard library functions (os.path) without executing or manipulating external data inputs. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The code is clean, simple, and serves a configuration utility purpose. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily utility functions for path management, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
