{
  "purpose": "Provide filesystem paths for theme-related assets (HTML, PDF, logos) for local build processes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file's directory path using os.path.abspath and os.path.dirname, and constructs paths based on predefined directory and filename strings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present; the code only constructs and returns filesystem paths.",
  "flows": "Source: get_pkg_path() obtaining the directory of the current file; Flow: get_theme_* functions build paths based on that directory; Sink: returning constructed paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code relies solely on standard library functions for path manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to generate paths to theme assets based on the location of the current script. It uses os.path functions to determine absolute paths and join paths for themes, logos, and PDFs. The functions are simple and do not involve untrusted input or external data sources. The only parameter with potential variability is the 'theme' argument, which defaults to 'openstackdocs'. No code execution, data leakage, or malicious behavior is observed. The functions are intended for local build processes and do not interact with network, environment variables, or external data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and solely constructs filesystem paths for theme assets without any malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
