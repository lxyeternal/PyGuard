  "purpose": "Provides filesystem paths for themes, logos, and PDF themes used in local build processes.",
  "sources": "__file__ variable to determine current script directory.",
  "sinks": "os.path functions that handle path concatenation and normalization.",
  "flows": "get_pkg_path() reads __file__, then path functions use this to build specific theme paths.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for constructing file system paths for themes and logos based on the script's location. It primarily uses os.path.abspath, os.path.dirname, and os.path.join with safe, static string inputs. The get_openstack_logo_path() provides backward compatibility by calling get_theme_logo_path() with a fixed argument. There are no external data sources, untrusted inputs, or network operations. No signs of malicious intent or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward utility module for managing theme and logo paths used in local builds. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
