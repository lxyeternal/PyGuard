{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for retrieving theme and logo paths for local builds, primarily for documentation styling.",
  "sources": "os.path functions and the __file__ variable to determine filesystem paths.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities; functions only construct filesystem paths.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; path functions use static and parameterized inputs but do not process external input or execute commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials or hidden backdoors. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions that generate paths based on the current file's directory and optional theme parameters. All functions use safe, standard library methods without executing external commands or handling untrusted input. The only parameterized input is 'theme', which defaults to a safe value and is used solely for constructing paths. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed to generate filesystem paths for themes and logos used in local documentation builds. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a legitimate utility module.",
