  "sources": "Static configuration variables, extension list, and project metadata.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or user input processed or utilized in sensitive contexts.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; configuration is static and predetermined.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code. All code consists of static configuration variables and comments.",
  "analysis": "The file is a standard Sphinx configuration script, setting up documentation parameters, extensions, themes, and project info. No user input handling, no external data fetching, nor code execution occurs here. It contains only static assignment statements, comments, and documentation-related settings. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical static configuration script for documentation purposes with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to security issues.",
