  "flows": "Imports → setup function → returns configuration",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (`from .paths import *`) which is a style concern but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup script with no network activity, data leaks, or dynamic code execution. The use of wildcard import is a style issue but does not introduce security risks. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minor style concern regarding wildcard import does not impact security.",
