  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package configuration using setuptools and pbr, primarily for packaging and distribution purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports setuptools and uses it to run the setup() function with specified requirements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only initializes package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "Imports from setuptools → calls setup() with specified parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscation detected. The comment indicates automated management of the file, which is typical for build/config files.",
