  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration script using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports setuptools and uses it to configure package setup.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; no network or file operations are performed.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code executes a straightforward setup call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard setup.py script that imports setuptools and calls setup() with a dependency requirement. It contains only licensing comments and no dynamic or malicious behavior. The code is typical for package configuration and does not perform any network activity, data processing, or code execution beyond setup. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify it as such, and the scores are appropriate. No further modifications are necessary.",
