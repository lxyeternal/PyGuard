  "purpose": "Retrieve version information for the 'openstackdocstheme' package using the pbr library.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'pbr.version' and instantiation of 'VersionInfo' object.",
  "fires": "The 'VersionInfo' object creation could potentially access package metadata, but it is a standard library call.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pbr.version' -> creation of 'VersionInfo' object for 'openstackdocstheme'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors; standard license comments and typical usage of pbr library.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of license comments, a standard import statement for 'pbr.version', and a straightforward instantiation of 'VersionInfo' to retrieve version info for a specific package. No input handling, no data leakage, and no suspicious behaviors are present. It performs a typical function for package version retrieval in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for fetching package version information using the pbr library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious or anomalous code, and poses no security risk.",
