  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data sinks or output operations",
  "flows": "Import of pbr.version -> creation of version_info object using VersionInfo()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for version handling",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard version management library (pbr) and creates a version info object for the package. It contains only license comments and typical import/use of the library. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard practice for version management in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version info setup for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
