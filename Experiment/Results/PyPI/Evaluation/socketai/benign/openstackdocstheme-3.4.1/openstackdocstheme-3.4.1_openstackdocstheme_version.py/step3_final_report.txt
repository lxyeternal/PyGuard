  "purpose": "Retrieve version information for the 'openstackdocstheme' package using pbr's VersionInfo.",
  "sources": "Import of pbr.version and creation of VersionInfo object for 'openstackdocstheme'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "Import of version module -> instantiation of VersionInfo object; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for obtaining package version info. It imports a well-known library and creates a VersionInfo object with a static package name. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leakage. The code does not perform network operations, handle user input, or execute dynamic code. All reports correctly identify this as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and purpose confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard snippet for version retrieval with no malicious intent or security issues. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
