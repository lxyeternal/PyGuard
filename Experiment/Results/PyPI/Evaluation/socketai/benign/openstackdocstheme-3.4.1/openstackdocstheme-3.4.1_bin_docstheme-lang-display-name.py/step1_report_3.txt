{
  "purpose": "The code reads a language code input from command line arguments, parses it using the babel library, and prints the full display name of the language.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1] (reads command line argument), babel.Locale.parse (reads the language code for parsing)",
  "sinks": "print(lo.get_display_name()) (outputs data to stdout), exception handling prints the original input",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv[1] -> babel.Locale.parse -> get_display_name() -> print output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code relies on user input without validation but does not perform any harmful actions. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts a language code as input and attempts to parse it with babel.Locale. If parsing succeeds, it outputs the full display name of the language. If parsing fails, it simply prints the original input. The code performs straightforward input parsing and output, with exception handling for invalid input. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration. It does not perform network operations, access system secrets, or execute untrusted code beyond the intended parsing and display functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for displaying language names based on input. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal, and there are no malware indications.",
