{
  "purpose": "Convert a language code provided as a command-line argument into its full display name using the babel library.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line argument sys.argv[1].",
  "sinks": "Prints output to stdout; no data leakage or untrusted data effects evident.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv[1] -> babel.Locale.parse -> get_display_name() -> print -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. The code uses exception handling to fallback to printing the original input if parsing fails.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts a language code as input via command line, parses it with babel.Locale.parse, and prints its display name. The use of exception handling is standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity. The dependencies are standard, and the logic is straightforward. No anomalies or obfuscation present. Overall, the code performs a benign function without security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple language code to name converter, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It securely handles input and output, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
