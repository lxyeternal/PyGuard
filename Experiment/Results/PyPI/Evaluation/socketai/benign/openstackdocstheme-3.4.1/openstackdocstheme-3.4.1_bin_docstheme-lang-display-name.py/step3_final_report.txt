  "flows": "Input from sys.argv[1] -> babel.Locale.parse() -> get_display_name() -> print()",
  "anomalies": "Exception handling that defaults to printing input; no malicious or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code accepts a language code, attempts to parse it with babel, and prints the display name or input on failure. It uses standard library functions with benign exception handling. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The logic is straightforward and secure, with minimal risk. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for locale display name conversion, with no malicious intent or security issues. The exception handling is benign, and the code is straightforward. The overall security risk is negligible, and malware likelihood is zero.",
