{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to accept a language code as input and output the full display name of that language using the babel library.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from command line argument sys.argv[1]",
  "sinks": "Outputs to standard output using print(), no sinks for untrusted data that cause harm or data leaks",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv[1] → babel.Locale.parse() → print(lo.get_display_name()) or fallback print(lang_code)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of babel is standard for locale processing; error handling is minimal but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a language code from command line input and attempts to parse it into a locale object with babel.Locale.parse(). If successful, it prints the locale's display name; if an exception occurs, it prints the original input. No external network calls, no suspicious data handling, and no obfuscation. The usage appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a locale display utility with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It handles user input without performing harmful actions. Overall, it's a simple, safe script.",
