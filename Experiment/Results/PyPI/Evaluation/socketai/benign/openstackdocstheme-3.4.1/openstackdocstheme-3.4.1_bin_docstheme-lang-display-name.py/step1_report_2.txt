{
  "purpose": "The code reads a language code input from the command line and outputs its display name using the Babel library.",
  "sources": "Reading command line argument 'sys.argv[1]'.",
  "sinks": "Printing output via 'print()', which outputs to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input from command line -> Babel locale parse -> Output display name or fallback to input code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or unusual code patterns observed. No network activity or external data leaks. Exception handling is generic but does not hide or perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script takes a language code as a command-line argument and attempts to parse it into a Babel Locale object. If parsing succeeds, it prints the display name of the locale; if parsing fails, it simply prints the input code. The use of Babel is standard for locale handling, and the exception handling is minimal but benign. No suspicious or malicious activity is present, and the code's structure is straightforward. No data leaks, injections, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for displaying the full name of a language code. It has no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
