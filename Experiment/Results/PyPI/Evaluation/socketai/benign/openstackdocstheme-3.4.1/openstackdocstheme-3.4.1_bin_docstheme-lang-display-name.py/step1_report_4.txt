  "purpose": "Convert a language code input into its display name using the babel library.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1] (reads command-line argument for language code)",
  "sinks": "print() (outputs the display name or fallback language code)",
  "flows": "Input from command-line argument -> babel.Locale.parse() -> print()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. The exception handling is generic and does not leak sensitive info.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts a language code as input via command-line argument, attempts to parse it into a Locale object using babel, and outputs the display name. If parsing fails, it simply outputs the original input. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. No data is transmitted externally, and there are no unsafe operations or obfuscation. Usage of babel for locale parsing is standard. No security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves a benign purpose of converting language codes to display names with proper error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
