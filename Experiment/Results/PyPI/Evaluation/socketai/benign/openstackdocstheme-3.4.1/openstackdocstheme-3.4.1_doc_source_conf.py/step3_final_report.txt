  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation, defining extensions, themes, static paths, and LaTeX options.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded variable assignments and static configuration parameters within the script.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script only assigns static values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration file for Sphinx documentation, containing only variable assignments, comments, and fixed parameters. It does not perform any dynamic operations, external data fetching, or network activity. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns, and the code's purpose is clear and standard for documentation setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
