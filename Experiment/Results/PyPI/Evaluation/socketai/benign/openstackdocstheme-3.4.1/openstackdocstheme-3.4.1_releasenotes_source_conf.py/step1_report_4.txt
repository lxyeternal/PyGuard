  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation generation, specifying settings for extensions, themes, output formats, and project metadata.",
  "sources": "Configuration variables, import statements (none present), and comments. No external data input or user input handling found.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted data or user input; the script primarily sets static configuration values.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script only defines static parameters without dynamic data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code is standard for a Sphinx config file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no network operations. It only contains static configuration settings for documentation generation, theme customization, output formats, and project metadata. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or backdoors. The absence of dynamic imports, input handling, or network communications indicates low risk of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical static configuration script for Sphinx documentation with no malicious or security-sensitive elements. It poses no security risks and contains no malware indicators.",
