  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation builder, defining settings and options for generating project documentation.",
  "sources": "Configuration variables, list assignments, import statements (if any), and string literals throughout the script.",
  "sinks": "None identifiable; the script primarily sets configuration parameters without executing external commands or handling untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script only assigns static configuration values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual constructs. All code is standard configuration for documentation generation.",
  "analysis": "The script consists solely of configuration settings for Sphinx documentation, including project info, themes, static paths, and output options. No user input processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns. All variables are static, and there are no evident attempts to access or leak sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is safe to use as part of the documentation build process.",
