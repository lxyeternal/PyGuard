  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation generation for the OpenStackdocstheme project.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration settings, extensions, project metadata, and static paths within the script.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe if external inputs were used, but here there are no such inputs or data sinks, only static configuration data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; this is purely static configuration with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code is standard configuration without dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static configuration settings for Sphinx documentation, including extensions, theme options, file paths, and project metadata. There are no input reads, no network connections, and no executable code logic that could be malicious. All variables are preset strings or lists related to documentation generation, with no signs of malicious payloads or obfuscated logic. The license comments and structured configuration are typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation, containing no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and purely declarative.",
