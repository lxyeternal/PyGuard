  "conclusion": "The primary security issue is the unsafe use of eval() on code generated from XML input, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if the XML is malicious. Although current tests are safe, the pattern is inherently dangerous. The malware score remains 0, but the security risk score should be high (~0.8). The code should be refactored to avoid eval() and implement safer parsing or evaluation strategies."
