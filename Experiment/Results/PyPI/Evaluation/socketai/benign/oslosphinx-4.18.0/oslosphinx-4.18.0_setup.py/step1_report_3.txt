{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools, primarily configuring package requirements and setup parameters.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'setuptools' and the try-except block for importing 'multiprocessing'.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call, which executes during package installation or build process.",
  "flows": "Import of 'setuptools' -> potential import of 'multiprocessing' -> execution of setuptools.setup() with specified parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, typical for Python package setup; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The try-except for 'multiprocessing' is standard to ensure compatibility across environments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for packaging, handles compatibility issues with older Python versions, and invokes setuptools.setup() with specific requirements. There is no evidence of data leaks, malicious payloads, or suspicious network activity. The code is standard package setup code, and no anomalies or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
