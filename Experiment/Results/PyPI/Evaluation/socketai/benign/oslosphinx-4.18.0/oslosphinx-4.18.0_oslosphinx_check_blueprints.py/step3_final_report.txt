  "purpose": "Validate that the spec file name matches an existing blueprint in specified projects by querying Launchpad APIs.",
  "sources": "API requests to 'https://api.launchpad.net/devel/%s/+spec/%s' and 'https://api.launchpad.net/1.0/%s/projects' for project and blueprint data.",
  "sinks": "API responses parsed as JSON to verify blueprint existence; no data leaks or untrusted sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters -> API URL templates -> requests.get() calls -> JSON parsing -> blueprint existence checks -> exception or logging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. Logging of URLs and blueprint names could expose info but is standard for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code performs external API calls to verify blueprint names against projects, with straightforward logic and no malicious behavior. It raises exceptions if blueprints are not found, which is appropriate. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The use of requests and JSON parsing is standard. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external dependencies and logging practices. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is around 0.1-0.2, reflecting low but present external API reliance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate validation utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, security risk=0.1-0.2. No adjustments necessary.",
