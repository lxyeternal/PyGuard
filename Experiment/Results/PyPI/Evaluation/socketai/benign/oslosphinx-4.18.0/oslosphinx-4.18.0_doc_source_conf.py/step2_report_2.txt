  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration script.\n- No evidence of untrusted data handling, external communications, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- All scores assigned are zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code is purely static configuration, importing only standard modules (`os`, `sys`).\n- The only modification is `sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../..'))`, which is typical for module discovery in documentation setups.\n- No user input, external data, or network activity.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- None detected. The code is standard and benign.\n- The high confidence scores (1.0) are justified given the clear benign nature.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Malware score: 0 in all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated: 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- Risk score: 0, appropriate for this static configuration script.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed to the scores or reasoning.\n- The code is entirely benign, with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the assessments in the reports.",
