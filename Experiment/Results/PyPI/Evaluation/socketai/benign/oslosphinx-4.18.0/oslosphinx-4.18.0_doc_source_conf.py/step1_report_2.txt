  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation generation for the 'oslosphinx' project.",
  "sources": "Reads system environment variables, file paths, and hardcoded configuration values; imports standard libraries (os, sys).",
  "sinks": "None evident. No untrusted data processing, user input, or output that could lead to data leakage or code execution.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks indicating malicious intent or leakage.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is a straightforward configuration script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules (os, sys), modifies sys.path, and sets up configuration variables for Sphinx documentation. No user input handling, network communication, or dynamic code execution present. The code is purely configuration and does not perform any operations that could be malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious code segments identified. The script adheres to typical documentation setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration script with no malicious or suspicious code. It poses no security risks.",
