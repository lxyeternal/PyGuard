{
  "purpose": "This code is a configuration script for Sphinx documentation, setting up extensions, theme, and project info.",
  "sources": "Standard modules 'os' and 'sys', and configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external data, or network activity; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, modifies sys.path for module discovery, and sets configuration variables for Sphinx. It contains no dynamic code, user input handling, network activity, or obfuscated constructs. All signals indicate benign static configuration. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The code's simplicity and adherence to typical configuration patterns support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
