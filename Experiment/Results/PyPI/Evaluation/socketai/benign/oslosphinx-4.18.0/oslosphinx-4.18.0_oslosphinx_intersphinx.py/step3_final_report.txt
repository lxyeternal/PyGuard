  "purpose": "Static configuration defining intersphinx mapping URLs for OpenStack projects and related documentation.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded URL strings within the 'mapping' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "None; static data assignment with no external data or output processing.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow beyond static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static with no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Python configuration file with licensing comments, a descriptive docstring, and a dictionary of documentation URLs. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, or external data fetching. All URLs are hardcoded strings. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent are present. The code's purpose is to facilitate documentation linking in Sphinx, which is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. The code poses no security threat, and the analysis across reports is accurate and thorough.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration file for documentation mapping with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assessments and scores in the reports are correct and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
