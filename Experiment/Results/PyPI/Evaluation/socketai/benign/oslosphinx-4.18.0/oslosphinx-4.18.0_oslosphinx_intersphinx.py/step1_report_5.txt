  "purpose": "Define a mapping dictionary for intersphinx linking to OpenStack and related project documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'mapping' dictionary, which contains URL strings and dictionary keys.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports no external modules, declares licensing info, and defines a static dictionary mapping project names to documentation URLs. It includes comments and licensing details but no dynamic code, external input, or potentially malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a static configuration mapping for documentation linking. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
