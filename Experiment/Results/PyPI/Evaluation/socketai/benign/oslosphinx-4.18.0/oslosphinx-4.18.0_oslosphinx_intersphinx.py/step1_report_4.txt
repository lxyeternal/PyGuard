  "purpose": "Define a mapping for intersphinx documentation linking for various OpenStack projects and related documentation sources.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data structures defining URLs and documentation mappings; no user input or external data is read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or code execution. No network or file I/O occurs based on this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely a static configuration definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors. The code is straightforward and consists solely of a documentation mapping dictionary.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Python script setting up a dictionary with URL mappings for documentation linking. It contains only comments, licensing information, and a data structure. There are no external inputs, code execution, or dynamic features. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign configuration file used for documentation purposes. It does not contain any malicious code or security risks.",
