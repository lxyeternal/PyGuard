No network activity, no obfuscation, no hidden code.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; primarily due to reliance on external cairo library, which is standard for graphics.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, well-structured code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, related to external library usage but not risky itself)\n\n**Overall:** The code is a standard, safe implementation of a 2D affine transformation matrix class for cairo graphics. No security issues or malicious intent are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to suggest any further security considerations or verify specific parts of the code?**",
