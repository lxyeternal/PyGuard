{
  "purpose": "Provides a class for 2D affine transformation matrices used in cairo graphics operations.",
  "sources": "Internal methods and external cairo library functions; no untrusted input handling.",
  "sinks": "Calls to cairo's API functions; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Performs internal matrix operations and transformations without external data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured wrapper around cairo's matrix functions, implementing standard affine transformations. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain hidden behaviors. External library calls are standard and used correctly. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of a 2D transformation matrix class for cairo graphics. No security issues or malicious intent are evident.",
