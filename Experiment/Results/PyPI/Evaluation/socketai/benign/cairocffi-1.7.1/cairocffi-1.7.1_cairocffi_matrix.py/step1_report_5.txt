  "purpose": "Provides a class for 2D affine transformation matrices used in graphics operations, including rotation, scaling, translation, and inversion.",
  "sources": "Initialization of matrices, rotation, scaling, translation, and inversion functions, and methods transforming points and distances.",
  "sinks": "Transformation functions that modify internal matrix state, and point/distance transformation methods.",
  "flows": "Methods like 'multiply', 'translate', 'scale', 'rotate', 'invert', 'transform_point', and 'transform_distance' modify internal state or process data, but do not transfer data outside the system or involve external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No external network activity or file operations. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The code solely performs matrix transformations and maintains internal state.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Matrix class for affine transformations in 2D space, leveraging 'cairo' graphics library functions via 'ffi'. All methods modify or utilize internal data with no external input/output operations. No data leaks, external communications, or malicious behaviors are present. The implementation appears straightforward and standard for graphics transformations. No signs of obfuscation or malicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of 2D affine matrices for graphics purposes, with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behaviors identified. It is safe to use from a security perspective.",
