  "purpose": "Defines a 2D affine transformation matrix class for use with the Cairo graphics library, enabling operations like rotation, scaling, translation, and inversion of transformation matrices.",
  "sources": "Import of internal modules '_check_status', 'cairo', and 'ffi'; creation and manipulation of 'cairo_matrix_t' via ffi; methods that invoke external C functions for matrix operations.",
  "sinks": "Calls to external C functions such as 'cairo.cairo_matrix_init', 'cairo.cairo_matrix_multiply', 'cairo.cairo_matrix_translate', 'cairo.cairo_matrix_scale', 'cairo.cairo_matrix_rotate', 'cairo.cairo_matrix_invert', 'cairo.cairo_matrix_transform_point', and 'cairo.cairo_matrix_transform_distance'. These are safe API calls for matrix operations and do not process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "The class initializes matrices with safe default values or parameters, and performs matrix operations through well-defined external functions, passing internally managed data. The data flow is controlled and limited to mathematical transformations without external untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code strictly wraps Cairo's matrix functions, providing mathematical transformations without external data manipulation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Matrix class for affine transformations using Cairo's C library. It securely wraps the external matrix functions with controlled Python methods, enabling transformations like rotate, scale, translate, invert, and point transformations. No use of external untrusted input, network access, file I/O, or obfuscated code. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The external functions are standard API calls to a graphics library, which are safe if used correctly. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or compromise security.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward and safe wrapper around Cairo's matrix functionality. It performs no malicious actions, does not handle untrusted input insecurely, and contains no suspicious or malicious code patterns. It is suitable for use in graphics applications without security concerns.",
