  "purpose": "Provides a class for creating and manipulating 2D transformation matrices used in graphical operations with cairo.",
  "sources": "None specifically reading untrusted input; primarily internal matrix operations and method calls.",
  "sinks": "None identified where untrusted data is processed in a dangerous manner.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code performs mathematical matrix operations, not data flow from input to output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No use of unsafe eval, exec, or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Matrix class that encapsulates affine transformation matrices, utilizing the cairo graphics library via ffi. It includes standard matrix operations such as rotation, scaling, translation, inversion, and transformation of points and distances. All operations are mathematical and involve no external data input or untrusted sources. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior. The only external library used is cairo, which is standard for graphics processing and not suspicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of 2D matrix transformations for use with cairo graphics. It performs no malicious actions, does not handle untrusted input insecurely, and contains no signs of malware or security risks.",
