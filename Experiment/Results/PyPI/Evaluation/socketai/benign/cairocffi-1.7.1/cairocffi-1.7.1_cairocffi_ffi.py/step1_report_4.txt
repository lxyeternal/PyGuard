{
  "purpose": "Build cffi bindings for Cairo graphics library, including support for xcb and GDK Pixbuf",
  "sources": "Reading constants from imported module, importing cffi, xcffib, and defining C declarations",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; functions are primarily bindings and definitions, no runtime data handling or I/O shown",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code only sets up bindings and includes headers without executing any untrusted code or data processing",
  "anomalies": "Absence of runtime input handling or external data processing; standard cffi setup, no obfuscated or suspicious code segments",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up foreign function interface (FFI) bindings for Cairo and GDK Pixbuf libraries using cffi. It imports constants, defines C function signatures, and includes additional headers if available. No runtime data processing, external input handling, or network operations are present. The inclusion of xcffib support is conditional on import success. The code appears to be a straightforward binding setup, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for cffi bindings with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It functions solely to define bindings for graphics libraries without executing or handling untrusted data.",
