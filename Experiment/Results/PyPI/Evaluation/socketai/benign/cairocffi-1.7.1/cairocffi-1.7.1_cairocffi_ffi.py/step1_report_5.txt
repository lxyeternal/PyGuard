{
  "purpose": "Builds cffi bindings for Cairo graphics library, including support for xcb and GdkPixbuf.",
  "sources": "Imports cffi, constants, and optionally xcffib. Reads constant header definitions and conditional import of xcffib. Loads header definitions into cffi objects.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; cffi functions and external headers define interactions with native libraries, which could potentially be exploited if malicious data were passed.",
  "flows": "Uses imported constants and headers to define FFI bindings. No data flow from untrusted sources is present within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic execution is present. Conditional import is benign and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes cffi objects and includes headers for Cairo and GdkPixbuf. It conditionally includes xcffib support if available. All code appears standard for setting up bindings, with no signs of malicious intent. No external data is read at runtime, and no network or system modification actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a standard setup for cffi bindings for Cairo and related libraries. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign dependency setup component.",
