{
  "purpose": "The code builds cffi bindings for Cairo graphics library, including support for xcb and GdkPixbuf, to facilitate interaction with C libraries from Python.",
  "sources": "Reading constants from constants module, importing from cffi and xcffib. Also includes function definitions for GdkPixbuf and Cairo.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data or system commands are present. The cffi interface is used for calling C functions, but no execution of untrusted input is observed.",
  "flows": "Code reads header constants, includes optional xcffib ffi, and defines bindings for GdkPixbuf and Cairo functions, which could be used to process images or graphics data, but no malicious data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns are present. Conditional import with fallback is standard. No suspicious dynamic code execution, backdoors, or malicious data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes cffi interfaces with headers from a constants module, optionally includes xcffib support, and defines bindings for GdkPixbuf and Cairo graphics functions. It appears to be a standard setup for using C libraries via cffi. No signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The code does not handle user input directly and only sets up foreign function interfaces.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical cffi binding setup for graphics libraries without any malicious behavior. It is intended to facilitate graphics processing in Python by binding to C libraries, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
