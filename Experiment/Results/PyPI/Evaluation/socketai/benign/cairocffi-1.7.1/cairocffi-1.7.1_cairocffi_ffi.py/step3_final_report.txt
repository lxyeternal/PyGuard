  "purpose": "Builds cffi bindings for Cairo, GDK Pixbuf, and optionally xcffib support.",
  "sources": "Reads header definitions from constants, attempts to import xcffib.ffi for optional support.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input processed; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Defines C function signatures and types; no runtime data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward binding setup, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup for cffi bindings to native libraries, with optional support for xcffib. It only defines C function signatures and data types, without executing code or handling external input. The optional import is handled gracefully, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code's purpose is purely to facilitate Python interaction with C libraries, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard binding setup with no malicious intent or security concerns. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting its safe, static nature.",
