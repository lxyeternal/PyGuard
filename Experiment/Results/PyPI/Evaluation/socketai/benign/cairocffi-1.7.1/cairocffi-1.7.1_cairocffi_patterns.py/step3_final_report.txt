  "purpose": "Python bindings for cairo pattern objects, providing classes to create and manipulate various pattern types such as solid colors, surfaces, and gradients.",
  "sources": "API function calls with parameters supplied by the user; no external untrusted data sources or network activity.",
  "sinks": "Calls to cairo C API functions that set or get pattern properties, with data flowing from method parameters into these functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (colors, matrices, pattern types) flow into cairo API functions; no external data or untrusted sources influence the flow beyond these parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard, well-structured Python wrapper around the cairo C API for pattern objects. It manages resources properly, performs error checking, and exposes pattern creation and property manipulation methods. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, which is a graphics library binding. The slight risk score reflects minimal inherent risk due to potential misuse if parameters are untrusted, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious Python binding for cairo pattern objects. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are justified and accurate.",
