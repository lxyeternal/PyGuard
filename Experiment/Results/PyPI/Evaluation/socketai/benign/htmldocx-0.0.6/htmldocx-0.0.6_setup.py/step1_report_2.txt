  "purpose": "The code is used for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code simply calls a setup function without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and calls setuptools.setup() with no arguments. This is standard for packaging Python projects and does not involve any data input or output, nor does it perform any operations that could be malicious. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or external data sources. The script appears to be a typical minimal setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies detected.",
