  "purpose": "This code is a minimal setup script for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could cause harm are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the code simply calls setuptools.setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal and standard; no anomalies, secrets, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls its setup() function without arguments, which is a common pattern in Python package distribution. There are no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The simplicity suggests it is a boilerplate setup script for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
