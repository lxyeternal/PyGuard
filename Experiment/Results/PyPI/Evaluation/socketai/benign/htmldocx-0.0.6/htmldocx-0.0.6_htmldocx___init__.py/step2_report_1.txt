  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence provided, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Only an import statement; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.8 (high)\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign; an import statement alone cannot pose a security risk. The high risk score seems unjustified given the minimal code and lack of malicious context.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce the risk score to 0, as there's no evidence of security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, a straightforward import with minimal context.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low)\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code snippet; no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep the scores as is, perhaps even consider risk=0, but 0.1 is acceptable for very minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; import statement with no apparent issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no security concern.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a simple import statement with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same benign import statement.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is justified given the code snippets.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk scores:** Except for Report 1, which is set at 0.8, all others are at 0 or very low, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Special note on Report 1:** The risk score of 0.8 is high for such a simple import statement. Unless additional context indicates malicious intent, this should be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust Report 1 risk score from 0.8 to 0.**  \n- **Maintain the other scores as they are, since they are consistent with the minimal and benign code snippets.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate based on the provided reports:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated code:** 0 — straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — simple imports from local modules pose negligible security risk.\n\nThis analysis underscores that these snippets are benign, and no malicious or obfuscated activity is evident.",
