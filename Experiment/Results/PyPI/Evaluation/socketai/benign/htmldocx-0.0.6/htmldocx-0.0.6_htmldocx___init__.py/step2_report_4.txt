  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue present?** No, the code is just an import statement.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence is 0.8, malware 0, risk 0.8. Given the code is benign, the risk score seems overstated. A score of 0.8 suggests high risk, which isn't justified here. I recommend lowering the securityRisk to 0, aligning with the benign nature.  \n- **Malware score?** 0, which is correct.  \n- **Summary:** The report correctly identifies the benign nature but overestimates the security risk.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue present?** No, just a straightforward import.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.1. The risk score is very low, which aligns with the benign assessment.  \n- **Malware score?** 0, correct.  \n- **Summary:** The report's assessment is consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue present?** No, minimal code.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.2, malware 0, risk 0.  \n- **Malware score?** 0, appropriate.  \n- **Summary:** The low confidence reflects limited information, but the assessment is correct.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue present?** No, simple import.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0.  \n- **Malware score?** 0, correct.  \n- **Summary:** Properly assessed as benign.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue present?** No, just an import statement.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0.  \n- **Malware score?** 0, correct.  \n- **Summary:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code snippet is benign, involving only an import statement.\n- The main inconsistency is in **Report 1**, where the securityRisk score (0.8) is too high given the benign nature. It should be lowered to 0.\n- The malware scores are correctly assigned as 0 across all reports.\n- The confidence scores are generally reasonable, though some are low due to limited context.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Should be very low (0) for all, since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### My recommendations:\n- Adjust **Report 1**'s `securityRisk` from 0.8 to **0**.\n- Keep the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0 for all reports.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet. The only correction needed is to align the risk scores with the actual security posture, which is minimal in this case.",
