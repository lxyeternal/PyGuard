  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; only an import statement with no additional logic. Cannot determine the behavior or intent solely from this line.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, which does not execute any logic or data handling. It references a local module (.h2d), which could contain any functionality, but based solely on this line, there's no indication of malicious activity or security risks. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a standard import, and further code would be needed to assess overall security risk.",
