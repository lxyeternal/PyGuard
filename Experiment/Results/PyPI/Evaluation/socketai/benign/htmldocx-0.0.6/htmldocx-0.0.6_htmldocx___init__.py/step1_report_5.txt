  "purpose": "Importing the HtmlToDocx class from a local module named h2d, likely for converting HTML to DOCX format.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module (.h2d). No external data sources or user input are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data processing, output, or network operations occur in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a module import from a relative package, indicating a modular design. It does not execute any operations, process data, or interact with external systems. Without additional context or implementation code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The import is standard practice in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger project, with no signs of malware or security concerns.",
