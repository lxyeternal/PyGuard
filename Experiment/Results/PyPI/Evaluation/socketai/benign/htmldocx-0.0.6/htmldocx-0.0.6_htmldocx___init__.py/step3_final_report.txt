  "purpose": "Importing the HtmlToDocx class from a local module named h2d, likely for document conversion purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions beyond importing.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows; this is a static import statement with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, which is a benign operation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The minimal nature of the code means the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score should be 0, reflecting no security concern. The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity. No further analysis or context is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, involving only a local import with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are needed.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
