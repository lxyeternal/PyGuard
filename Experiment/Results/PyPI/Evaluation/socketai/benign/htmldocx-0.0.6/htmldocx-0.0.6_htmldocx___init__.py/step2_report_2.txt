  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe a single import statement: `from .h2d import HtmlToDocx`.\n- The code is minimal, with no executable logic, data handling, or network activity.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the simplicity of the code.\n- Malware scores are zero across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of an import statement.\n- Security risk scores are low, mostly zero, with one report assigning 0.1, likely due to the import from a local module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The reports correctly identify that this is just an import statement with no malicious activity or anomalies.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports do not overstate the risk; they acknowledge the limited scope of the code snippet.\n- The high confidence levels are justified given the simplicity.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk scores:** Mostly 0, with one at 0.1. Given the minimal code, this seems reasonable, though a slightly higher score could be justified if the module `h2d` is untrusted or from an unknown source, but this cannot be inferred solely from the import statement.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports do not consider the context of the `h2d` module. If `h2d` is malicious or compromised, the import could be risky. However, with only this snippet, we cannot assess that.\n- No assumptions are made about the content of `h2d`, which is correct.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is observable.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remains 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a score of 0 or 0.1 is appropriate. No higher risk is justified without additional context.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the potential risk if the module is malicious, but this is speculative)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. The code snippet is benign, and no malicious activity or security flaws are evident. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary based on this snippet alone.",
