  "purpose": "Importing the HtmlToDocx class from a local module named h2d.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the module '.h2d', which is a local relative import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; this code only imports a class.",
  "flows": "No data flow beyond module import; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in this single line; the import appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, which is standard practice in Python projects. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident in this minimal snippet. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. The context is limited to a simple import statement, so no further risk analysis can be performed without additional code.",
  "conclusion": "This code only performs a local module import with no malicious behavior detected. It appears safe based on this snippet alone.",
