{
  "purpose": "Implement basic assertion helper functions for value comparisons and checks.",
  "sources": "None; the code defines functions that accept input parameters, which are intended to be called elsewhere with data.",
  "sinks": "None; functions return boolean results based on input parameters without performing actions that could lead to data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions; no external data or untrusted sources are processed within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The functions are straightforward and serve as utility checks.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple utility functions performing comparison and containment checks. No data is read from external sources, nor is there any dynamic code execution or network activity. The functions do not contain any logic that could be exploited maliciously, nor do they perform side effects. The code appears to be a standard set of assertions for testing purposes, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility module for assertions and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a safe component intended for validation within larger codebases.",
