  "purpose": "A collection of utility assertion functions for comparison, containment, string operations, and length checks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to each function (values, other, term, etc.) used for comparisons and checks.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the return statements; however, they only perform comparisons and string methods without side effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into comparison or string methods, with results returned directly; no external data flow or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, stateless, and uses only Python built-ins.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of simple, stateless functions performing basic comparisons and string checks. There are no external data sources, network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The functions serve as utility assertions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility library with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate and appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
