{
  "purpose": "Implement basic assertion functions for comparison and containment checks",
  "sources": "None explicitly; functions receive input parameters, possibly from external data if used in broader code",
  "targets": "Return statements output boolean results; no untrusted data is directly used to influence system state or security-sensitive operations",
  "flows": "Input parameters are compared or checked within functions, no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed; all functions perform standard comparison operations",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of simple comparison and containment functions intended for assertions or validation. It imports annotations but does not utilize them, which does not affect security. No input validation or external data handling occurs within these functions. No network, file I/O, or environment variable access is present. The functions are straightforward and perform basic operations only. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of harmless, utility assertion functions with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility module intended for internal validation purposes.",
