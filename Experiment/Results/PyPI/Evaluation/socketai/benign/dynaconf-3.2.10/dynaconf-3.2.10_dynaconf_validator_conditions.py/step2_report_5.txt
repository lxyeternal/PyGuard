  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code against the claims, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward set of assertion helper functions: comparisons, containment, length checks, string startswith/endswith, identity, and type checks.\n- No external data sources, no network or file I/O, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation.\n- All functions operate purely on their input parameters.\n- The code is benign, utility in nature, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n**Summary:**\n- Confirms benign, straightforward utility functions.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or security risks detected.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report's conclusion aligns with the code.\n- No issues found.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Obfuscated: 0.0 (correct)\n- Malware: 0.0 (correct)\n- Security risk: 0.0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** **Appropriate scoring.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to Report 1, confirms benign utility functions.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Accurate; no external data or malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Obfuscated: 0.0\n- Malware: 0.0\n- Security risk: 0.0\n\n**Verdict:** **Appropriate scoring.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n**Summary:**\n- Same as above, utility functions with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correct; no issues detected.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Obfuscated: 0.0\n- Malware: 0.0\n- Security risk: 0.0\n\n**Verdict:** **Appropriate scoring.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n**Summary:**\n- Again, utility functions with no suspicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Consistent with the code.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Obfuscated: 0.0\n- Malware: 0.0\n- Security risk: 0.0\n\n**Verdict:** **Appropriate scoring.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n**Summary:**\n- Same conclusion: benign, utility functions, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correct.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Obfuscated: 0.0\n- Malware: 0.0\n- Security risk: 0.0\n\n**Verdict:** **Appropriate scoring.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, utility functions with no obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (all zeros) are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No claims are based on assumptions; all are cautious and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (no security risks)\n\nThe code is a safe, straightforward utility library with no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
