{
  "purpose": "Provide basic assertion functions for validation checks in other code modules.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read external input; they operate on provided arguments.",
  "sinks": "None; all functions perform in-memory comparisons or string methods without side effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as input is passed as function arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Functions are straightforward and typical for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple comparison and string validation functions, serving as utility assertions. No external data sources, no network operations, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code. The functions rely solely on standard Python operators and string methods, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. They are safe, generic validation helpers, and do not perform any actions that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard validation functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It poses no threat or suspicious activity, serving as safe utility code.",
