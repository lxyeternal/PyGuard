  "purpose": "Implement basic assertion functions for value comparison and validation.",
  "sources": "None; all functions operate on input parameters only.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written, transmitted, or stored by this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; functions perform comparisons and checks on provided arguments.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of straightforward comparison functions with no obfuscated code, external calls, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of simple assertion helper functions that compare or check properties of input values, such as equality, inequality, greater/less than, type, containment, length, and string start/end. It imports annotations but does not use them. There are no external data sources, no network activity, no cryptographic operations, and no file system interactions. The functions are basic and do not include any security-sensitive operations. There is no indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The code appears to be a utility library intended for use in other parts of a project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign collection of assertion helper functions with no malicious intent, malware, or security risks detected. It is straightforward, lacks obfuscated code, and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
