{
  "purpose": "Provide basic assertion functions for validating values and conditions in Python code.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily defines functions that accept input parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; the functions return boolean evaluations based on input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions and produce boolean outputs; no external data flow or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; functions are straightforward and do not perform side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple, stateless assertion functions for comparison and containment checks. No external data reading, no data manipulation, and no dynamic execution are present. The functions only return boolean values based on the inputs. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code does not interact with the network, file system, environment variables, or perform any obfuscated or malicious operations. Overall, the code appears to serve as a utility library for assertions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic collection of assertion utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe, straightforward, and non-malicious.",
