  "purpose": "Configuration management, environment variables, external services, dotenv loading, and dynamic reloads for dynaconf.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, dotenv files, configuration files, external services (Redis, Vault).",
  "sinks": "Environment variables influencing configuration; external service configurations; module reloads.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and dotenv files load data into configuration settings; external service configs are read from environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscation detected. Use of warnings and reload functions are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard configuration setup for dynaconf, managing environment variables, dotenv files, and external services. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The environment variables are used for secrets but are managed through standard practices. The reload function is a utility, not malicious. The code does not contain any suspicious patterns or malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2) are justified based on the code's nature and typical security considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration management script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is low, primarily related to environment variable handling, which is standard practice. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code.",
