{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration file extensions, external loaders, and templates for dynamic configuration loading using the dynaconf library.",
  "sources": "Constants for file extensions, external loader definitions, string templates for Django and instance configuration, and default settings file list.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data being processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "Constants and templates are static; no dynamic data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The templates contain placeholder strings but no dynamic execution or code injection.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up configuration parameters and templates for the dynaconf library, which manages application settings. It includes lists of file extensions, external loader identifiers, and string templates for Django and generic instances. There is no code that executes user input, loads external data at runtime, or performs any network or file operations. The presence of templates and static configuration data suggests this is preparatory code, not active or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as configuration setup for dynaconf-based applications. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscated logic, or security risks. No malicious intent or security threat is evident.",
