  "purpose": "Define file extension constants, external loaders, and templates for configuration management using dynaconf in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Constants for file extensions, loader definitions, and template strings for dynaconf initialization.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the use of external loaders and templates could be misused if loaded dynamically or executed in an unsafe context, but in this static code, no direct sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Constants and loader definitions are static; templates are predefined strings intended for dynamic use but are not executed here.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code primarily sets up configuration management with known libraries and static strings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines file extensions and configuration loader mappings, along with templates for initializing dynaconf in Django and other projects. No dynamic execution, input handling, or insecure practices are evident. The templates could be used for dynamic code generation, but as provided, they are static strings. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, no network connections, data exfiltration, or system manipulation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard setup code for configuration management using dynaconf, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe based on the provided snippet.",
