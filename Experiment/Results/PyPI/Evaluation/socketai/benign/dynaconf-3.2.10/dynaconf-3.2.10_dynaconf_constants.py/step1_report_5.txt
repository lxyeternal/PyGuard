  "purpose": "Define constants, configurations, and templates for dynamic configuration loading using dynaconf.",
  "sources": "Static definitions, such as extension tuples, loader string mappings, and template strings; no input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the code dynamically loads configuration files via dynaconf, which can include untrusted data if user-controlled files are used, but no direct untrusted input handling is visible.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows; the configuration templates and loader mappings suggest dynamic loading but no actual data flow or processing is shown.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors. The code includes only configuration templates and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines constants and string templates for configuration loading. It references dynaconf loaders and settings files but does not perform any data processing, input handling, or network communication. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual behavior are present. The code could be part of a larger application that loads external configuration files, which could pose security risks if untrusted files are used, but this is outside the scope of the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard configuration setup for a Python application using dynaconf. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this fragment. The main risk would depend on how these configurations are used elsewhere with untrusted input, but as-is, it seems benign.",
