{
  "purpose": "Defines constants, configurations, and templates for loading configuration files using dynaconf in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions for file extensions, dictionaries for loaders, and string templates for dynamic code generation.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly uses untrusted data or performs unsafe operations; no explicit sinks for data leaks or command execution.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily sets up configurations and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; templates are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines various configuration file extensions, loader identifiers, and code snippets for integrating dynaconf into projects. The dynamic templates (DJANGO_PATCH, INSTANCE_TEMPLATE) facilitate runtime configuration but do not execute or evaluate untrusted data. No apparent network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are embedded. The code appears to be boilerplate or setup code for managing configurations with no malicious intent or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup for dynaconf in Python projects, with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
