{
  "purpose": "This code defines configuration file extensions, loaders, and templates for use with the dynaconf library to manage application settings.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, string templates, and imported modules (e.g., dynaconf). No external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not perform any data writes or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only sets up configuration templates and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is purely declarative and template-based.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations, defines tuples of configuration file extensions, and sets up dictionaries and string templates for configuration loading via dynaconf. It also constructs default filenames for configuration files. There are no user inputs, network communications, or code execution outside of static definitions. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for dynaconf with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It mainly provides constants and templates for managing settings files.",
