  "purpose": "Static configuration setup for dynaconf, defining file extensions, loaders, and templates for environment management.",
  "sources": "Constants defining file extensions, loader mappings, and string templates for configuration initialization.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static definitions without data flow.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static constants and templates are used as-is.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, setting up constants and templates for configuration management. It contains no dynamic execution, no user input handling, no network operations, and no embedded secrets. The static nature and lack of code execution paths indicate no malicious intent or obfuscation. The small risk scores assigned in some reports reflect potential misuse if these templates are loaded dynamically from untrusted sources, but the code itself remains benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, static configuration scaffolding with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or active security vulnerabilities. The risk scores are appropriately low, and the assessments across reports are consistent and accurate.",
