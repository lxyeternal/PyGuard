  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration management system with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The potential risks stem from its dynamic features, which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted, but this does not constitute malware. Scores should reflect low malware presence and minimal obfuscation, with a moderate security risk due to the inherent nature of dynamic loading."
