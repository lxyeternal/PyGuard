{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'dynaconf', including reading files, defining requirements, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'VERSION' and 'README.md' files, environment variables (if used elsewhere), and package data files.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the script primarily performs file reading and package setup.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and long description from files, passes data to setuptools setup, no external data flows to untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual or obfuscated code, and no network activity or system modification is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It defines a 'read' function to load files, specifies dependencies, and calls setup() with package metadata and configuration. The 'read' function safely opens and reads files, with no indications of malicious behavior. No use of environment variables, network operations, or dynamic code execution is detected. All dependencies are declared explicitly. The code structure and content align with common Python package setup scripts and do not exhibit any signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical and legitimate setup script for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code fragment.",
