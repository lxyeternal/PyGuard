  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a setup script for 'dynaconf', reading version and README files, and defining dependencies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks or malicious data flows are detected.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code appears standard; no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that this is a benign setup script with high confidence (1) is accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the standard nature of the setup script, reading files, defining dependencies, and no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, with no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also confirms the code is a typical setup script, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies the code as legitimate.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates the standard setup process, safe file reading, and dependency declaration.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid assessment of a benign script.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as others, confirming no suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code Content & Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward, standard `setup.py` script for a Python package.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Risk Level:** The package setup process itself is low risk; no external data flows or dynamic code execution.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports assign zero to malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores, which is consistent with the code's content.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Note:** Given the absence of any suspicious elements, these scores seem appropriate. If any future reports suggest malicious intent or obfuscation, these scores should be revisited.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or obfuscated code. The assigned scores are reasonable and justified.",
