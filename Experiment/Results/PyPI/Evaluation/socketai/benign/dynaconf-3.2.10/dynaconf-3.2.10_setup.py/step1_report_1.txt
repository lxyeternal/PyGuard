{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'dynaconf', including package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'dynaconf/VERSION' and 'README.md' for version and long description; package discovery via find_packages; dependency declarations.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes (beyond reading), or execution of untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "Read version and README files -> setup configuration -> package metadata and dependencies. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code appears to be a standard setup script using setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, defines a function to read file contents safely, and configures package setup parameters. Dependencies are specified in a typical manner. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling is evident. The file is a straightforward package configuration script, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package setup script with no malicious behavior detected. It only performs package configuration and metadata declaration.",
