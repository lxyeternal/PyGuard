{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'dynaconf', used to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "File reading functions (read()), package metadata definitions, dependency lists, and setup parameters.",
  "targets": "No explicit handling of untrusted data or user input; configuration and static data are used.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code reads static files for long description and version info, then uses this data in setup() without any data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. The 'read' function handles file reading securely, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs static setup tasks: reading version and description files, defining dependencies, and configuring package metadata. All file operations appear standard. No dynamic or unsafe behaviors are evident. No data leakage, malicious actions, or malicious code patterns are present. The dependencies listed are common and relevant for the package's functionality. There is no code that interacts with external data sources at runtime, nor any suspicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or supply chain attacks. The script is safe for use.",
