  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies the script as a standard setup configuration for 'dynaconf', with no suspicious data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks or malicious data flows are present.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly concludes that this is a benign setup script with no security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This is appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, it confirms the code as a standard setup script, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also correctly identifies the code as a typical setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same assessment: standard setup script, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with others, confirming no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero in all reports; the code is purely for package setup.\n- **Security risk:** None identified; no untrusted data handling or network activity.\n\n### Final thoughts:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk all at 0) are appropriate.\n- Given the straightforward nature of the code, I agree with the assessments.\n\n### My estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scores are justified and should remain as is.",
