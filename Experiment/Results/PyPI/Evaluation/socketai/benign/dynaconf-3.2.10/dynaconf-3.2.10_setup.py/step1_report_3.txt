{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the dynaconf Python project, defining dependencies, package data, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading version from 'dynaconf/VERSION', reading long description from 'README.md', importing system modules, defining dependencies.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations, package setup parameters, potentially external URL for project.",
  "flows": "Version and description files are read from the filesystem; dependencies and entry points are set for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. The 'read' function reads files securely. No suspicious dynamic code execution, no network operations, no credential leaks.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python packaging practices with setuptools, reading version and description files, and defining dependencies. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution. No data leaks or malicious network activity. All dependencies are typical for a Python package. The code is straightforward and adheres to normal setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It securely reads necessary files, defines dependencies, and configures package metadata without any suspicious or malicious actions.",
