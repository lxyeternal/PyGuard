  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'dynaconf', reading version and description files, configuring dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading local files ('VERSION', 'README.md') for version and description; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Reading local files to populate package metadata; no malicious data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration using setuptools, with clear structure and no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. It reads local files for versioning and description, defines dependencies, and sets package metadata. No external data sources, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The code adheres to standard practices for Python package setup, with no anomalies or risky constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe and legitimate configuration.",
