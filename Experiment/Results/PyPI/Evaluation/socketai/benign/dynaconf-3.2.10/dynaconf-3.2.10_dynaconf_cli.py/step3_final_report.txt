  "purpose": "CLI for managing dynaconf configurations, supporting various formats and framework integrations.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, config files, stdin/stdout, dynamic module imports, URL opening, environment variable setting.",
  "sinks": "Configuration files, environment variables, code files (e.g., Django, Flask), web browser.",
  "flows": "User inputs and commands lead to dynamic imports, file creation/modification, environment variable adjustments, URL opening.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'os.environ' modification, dynamic module imports based on user input, appending code to project files, URL opening commands.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration management tasks with dynamic imports and file modifications. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. Dynamic imports and file writes could be exploited if user inputs are malicious, but these are typical features of such CLI tools. No network activity or backdoors detected. The operations are controlled and predictable, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate CLI tool for configuration management with inherent risks related to misuse of dynamic imports and file modifications. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity is detected. The overall security risk is low but warrants cautious use in untrusted environments.",
