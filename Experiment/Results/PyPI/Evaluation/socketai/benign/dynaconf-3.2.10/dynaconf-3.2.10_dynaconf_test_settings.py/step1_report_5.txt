  "purpose": "Configuration setup for dynamic configuration loaders in a Python application",
  "sources": "Constant assignment to the variable LOADERS_FOR_DYNACONF",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted input processing observed",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out loader suggests potential future or experimental configuration; no malicious code or backdoors detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature, sets a testing flag, and defines a list of configuration loaders for dynaconf. The list includes environment loader and a commented redis loader, which are standard and not suspicious. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present. Overall, the code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration setup with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not read or process untrusted data, and no suspicious activities are detected.",
