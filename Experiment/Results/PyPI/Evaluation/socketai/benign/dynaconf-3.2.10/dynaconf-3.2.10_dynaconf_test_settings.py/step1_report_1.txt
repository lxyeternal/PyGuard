  "purpose": "Configure environment loaders for the Dynaconf configuration management tool",
  "sources": "Assignment to the variable LOADERS_FOR_DYNACONF and the value of the TESTING variable",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is being sent or written to external sources",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only sets configuration variables",
  "anomalies": "Presence of commented-out code indicating potential future or optional loader, but nothing malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple configuration snippet that sets a testing flag and defines a list of environment loaders for Dynaconf. There are no external data inputs, network communications, or dynamic code execution. The commented-out loader does not indicate malicious intent; it appears to be an optional configuration. No secrets, credentials, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign configuration setup with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prepares some settings for a Python application using Dynaconf.",
