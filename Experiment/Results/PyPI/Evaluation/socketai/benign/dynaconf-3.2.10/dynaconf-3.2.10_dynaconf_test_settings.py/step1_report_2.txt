{
  "purpose": "The code is configuring settings related to dynamic configuration loading, specifically for the Dynaconf library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the hardcoded boolean value 'TESTING' and the list 'LOADERS_FOR_DYNACONF'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of the 'dynaconf.loaders.env_loader' which could load environment variables, possibly containing sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded configuration variables (TESTING, LOADERS_FOR_DYNACONF) to the configuration management system (Dynaconf).",
  "anomalies": "The code contains commented-out code ('dynaconf.loaders.redis_loader') which indicates possible future or experimental configurations. No other anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, defining configuration constants for the Dynaconf library. No user input handling, no external data processing, and no code execution occurs. The presence of 'TESTING' suggests a development or testing environment. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code appears standard for configuration setup, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple configuration setup for Dynaconf with no malicious behavior detected. It does not pose security risks and appears to be standard practice for managing environment loaders during development or testing.",
