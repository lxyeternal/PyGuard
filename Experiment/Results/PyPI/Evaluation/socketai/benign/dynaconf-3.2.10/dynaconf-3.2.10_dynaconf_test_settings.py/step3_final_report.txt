  "purpose": "Define a boolean flag for testing mode and specify configuration loaders for Dynaconf.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static code.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out loader ('redis_loader') is standard, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration snippet with static variables. It contains no dynamic code execution, no external data input, and no network activity. The commented line is a typical optional configuration and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest benign purpose. The security risk score could be lowered to zero, as there are no security concerns. Malware score is correctly zero; obfuscated score is zero; the minimal risk score (0.1) is slightly overstated given the benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, though the security risk score can be adjusted to zero for accuracy.",
