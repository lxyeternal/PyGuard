  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a Python application, specifying environment loading modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads the boolean value 'TESTING' and the list 'LOADERS_FOR_DYNACONF', which are hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows or untrusted data from sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors observed. The use of pragma and future imports are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a testing flag and a list of loader modules for dynaconf configuration management. There are no user inputs, environment variables, or external data sources. The code appears to be a simple configuration setup with no indication of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration snippet without any malicious intent or security issues. It solely defines static variables for configuration purposes.",
