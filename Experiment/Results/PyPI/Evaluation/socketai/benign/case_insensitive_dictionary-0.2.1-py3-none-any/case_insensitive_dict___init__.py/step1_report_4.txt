{
  "purpose": "To import and expose components of the 'case-insensitive-dictionary' package, including version detection and module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements for version info, package metadata, and local module components.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Version info retrieval from package metadata; export of local modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; straightforward import and version detection logic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to determine the package version using importlib.metadata (or fallback to importlib_metadata). It gracefully handles missing package info by setting version to 'unknown'. It then imports specific components from a local module and defines __all__ for exports. The code structure is standard for package metadata and module exports, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated logic, or malicious behaviors. No external network calls, data leaks, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization script for a Python package, focusing on version detection and exposing components. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
