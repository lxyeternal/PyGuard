{
  "purpose": "This code manages versioning and imports for the 'case-insensitive-dictionary' package, exposing specific classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Reads the package version using importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata; imports local modules 'case_insensitive_dict' for classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs are visible.",
  "flows": "The version retrieval source flows to setting the __version__ variable; imports from local modules do not involve external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. Use of try-except for version retrieval is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection to import versioning functions and then attempts to retrieve the package version. It conditionally imports local modules and exposes certain classes/functions via __all__. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activities. The code appears to be standard package setup code, with proper handling of missing package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup component for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It safely manages version info and exposes public API elements.",
