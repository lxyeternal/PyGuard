{
  "purpose": "This code is used to import and expose components related to a case-insensitive dictionary implementation, including version detection and module exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own package metadata via importlib.metadata/version to determine the package version.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that process untrusted input or data that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import version info, handle exceptions, define exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious imports or unusual code structures. Use of try-except for version retrieval is standard practice. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to retrieve its package version using importlib.metadata, falling back to importlib_metadata for compatibility. It then imports specific classes and functions from a local module and defines the __all__ variable for exports. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard package initialization tasks without any malicious intent or security risks. It simply exposes specific components and manages version info, with no anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
