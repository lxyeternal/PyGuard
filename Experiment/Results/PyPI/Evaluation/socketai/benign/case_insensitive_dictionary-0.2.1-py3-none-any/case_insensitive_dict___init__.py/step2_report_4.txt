  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the potential security implications.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard package initialization (__init__.py) that retrieves its own version and exposes certain classes/functions.\n- No suspicious imports, code obfuscation, or external network activity are mentioned.\n- The logic is straightforward: attempt to get version info, handle exceptions, import local modules, define __all__.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or data leaks are indicated.\n- The code does not process untrusted input or data.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches the description; it performs standard version detection and module exports.\n- No issues are present in the code snippets provided.\n\n### Flaws, errors, or mistakes:\n- None identified. The code follows best practices for version detection with fallback handling.\n- No logical errors or security flaws.\n\n### Scores given by reports:\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0\n- These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n### Justification of risk and malware scores:\n- Since there's no malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation, scores of 0 are justified.\n- The code's purpose is purely to initialize package metadata and exports.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- The only point to consider is the use of `importlib.metadata` which could leak package info, but this is benign and standard practice.\n- No assumptions about malicious behavior are supported by the code.\n\n### Consistency:\n- Scores are consistent with the reports' analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is typical for Python package initialization.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the provided scores. The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's straightforward nature.",
