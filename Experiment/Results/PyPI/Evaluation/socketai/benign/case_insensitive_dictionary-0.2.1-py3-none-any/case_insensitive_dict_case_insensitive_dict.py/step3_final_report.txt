  "purpose": "Implementation of a case-insensitive dictionary that preserves original key casing, with JSON serialization/deserialization support.",
  "sources": "Data provided during initialization (mapping or iterable of key-value pairs).",
  "sinks": "Access via __getitem__, __setitem__, and JSON encoder/decoder functions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into internal _data dict; __setitem__ converts keys to lowercase; JSON encoder serializes _data values; decoder reconstructs the object from a mapping.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network operations, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured utility class for case-insensitive key handling, with standard methods for dict operations and JSON support. It uses typical internal data storage (_data) and standard Python typing. No malicious patterns, external system interactions, or obfuscation are present. The JSON encoder and decoder are simple and safe. The code does not process untrusted input in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities. Overall, the implementation aligns with best practices for such a utility, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility class for case-insensitive dictionaries with JSON support. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the utility nature of the code.",
