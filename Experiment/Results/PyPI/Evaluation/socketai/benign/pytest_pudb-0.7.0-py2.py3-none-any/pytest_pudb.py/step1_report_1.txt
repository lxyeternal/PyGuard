{
  "purpose": "Provides integration of the PuDB debugger with pytest, allowing debugging on test failures or internal errors.",
  "sources": "Configuration functions, exception handling hooks, and internal debugger management within the PuDBWrapper class.",
  "sinks": "Calls to pudb._get_debugger() and interaction functions that could potentially invoke debugging sessions.",
  "flows": "On errors or exceptions, the code triggers _enter_pudb, which calls post_mortem, leading to pudb._get_debugger() invocation for debugging interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic code execution. Usage of internal debugging functions is standard for debugging tools.",
  "analysis": "The code defines pytest hooks to integrate PuDB, a Python debugger, enabling debugging on test failures and internal errors. It swaps out pudb._get_debugger with its own method to control debugger invocation. The methods for handling exceptions and internal errors ultimately call pudb._get_debugger() to initiate debugging sessions. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed in a malicious manner. The code manages internal plugin and configuration states without evidence of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious data transmission. All code flows appear to be standard debugging and error handling procedures. No suspicious code patterns or indicators of malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely functions to integrate a debugger with pytest for improved debugging capabilities. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious activities. It is a legitimate debugging utility module without security risks.",
