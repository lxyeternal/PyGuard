{
  "purpose": "This code integrates the PuDB debugger into pytest for interactive debugging during test failures or errors.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from pytest, accesses plugin manager, retrieves traceback and exception info, and calls debugger functions.",
  "sinks": "Invokes pudb._get_debugger() which returns a debugger instance; uses debugger to start interaction, access stack frames, and display tracebacks.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from pytest into the wrapper; exception info triggers _enter_pudb, leading to post_mortem, which calls debugger interactions and stack retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "Uses internal pytest plugin hooks; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; no external network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest plugin extension to integrate PuDB debugger, with functions to mount/unmount debugger, handle exceptions, and manage IO capture. It modifies internal pytest behavior to trigger debugging sessions on errors or internal errors, and restores previous states after. No malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious data flows identified. The use of debugger functions appears consistent with debugging workflows, and no suspicious external calls or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate pytest plugin for integrating PuDB debugger, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It modifies internal pytest behavior solely for debugging purposes and does not include malicious or sabotage code.",
