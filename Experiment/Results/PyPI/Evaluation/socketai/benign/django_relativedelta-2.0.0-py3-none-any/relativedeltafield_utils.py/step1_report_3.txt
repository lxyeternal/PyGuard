{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse, format, and handle ISO8601 duration strings and convert them to relativedelta objects, primarily for database interval representations.",
  "sources": "Input sources include strings matching ISO8601 or custom CSV formats, and timedelta or relativedelta objects.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, files, or network; it only processes and returns relativedelta or formatted strings within the runtime.",
  "flows": "Input strings are matched against regex patterns, parsed into relativedelta objects, and then possibly formatted back into strings. Data flows are internal, from input to output, with no external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The regex patterns are standard for ISO8601 parsing. No external or suspicious data handling is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code accurately parses ISO8601 and similar duration formats into relativedelta objects, and formats these objects back into strings. The regex patterns are well-formed and standard for such parsing tasks. No external data operations, network calls, or unsafe code practices are found. The functions only perform data transformation and formatting. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior in data handling, code flow, or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for handling ISO8601 durations and related formats. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks are identified. It functions solely as a data processing utility without external side effects.",
