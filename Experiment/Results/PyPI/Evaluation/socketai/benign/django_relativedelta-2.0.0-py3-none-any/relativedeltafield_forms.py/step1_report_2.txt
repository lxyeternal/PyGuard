{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom Django form field for handling relative date/time intervals in ISO8601 format.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through the 'value' parameter in methods 'prepare_value', 'to_python', and 'clean'.",
  "sinks": "The code calls external functions 'parse_relativedelta' and 'format_relativedelta' which may process the input data; however, there are no direct data sinks like network, file, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input flows from the 'value' parameter through 'to_python' and 'clean' for validation and parsing, with 'prepare_value' formatting the data for display.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code constructs, or obfuscated segments. The code relies on external utility functions but does not perform dangerous operations directly.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom Django form field for handling relative date/time intervals. It uses external utility functions for parsing and formatting, which are likely safe if they are well-maintained. There are no network operations, system modifications, or security-sensitive actions performed within this snippet. The try-except blocks handle parsing errors gracefully, raising validation errors for invalid input. Overall, the code appears straightforward and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom form field with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external utilities for parsing and formatting without performing any dangerous actions.",
