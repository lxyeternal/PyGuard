  "purpose": "Implement a Django form field for parsing and formatting relative date/time intervals using external utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input data from user via form, external functions parse_relativedelta and format_relativedelta",
  "sinks": "None; no external system calls or data exfiltration points present",
  "flows": "Input string -> to_python() -> parse_relativedelta (external) -> return object; prepare_value() -> format_relativedelta (external) -> formatted string",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling masks specific errors; reliance on external functions without verification; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django form field subclass that uses external utilities for parsing and formatting relative intervals. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. Exception handling is broad but typical for validation. External functions' security is unknown but presumed safe. No network, file, or system manipulation occurs. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's simplicity and external dependency assumptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation with low security risk. No malware or obfuscation detected. The reliance on external utilities is a minor concern but does not elevate risk significantly. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
