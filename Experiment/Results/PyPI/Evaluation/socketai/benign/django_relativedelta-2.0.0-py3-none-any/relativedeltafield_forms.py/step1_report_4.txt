{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom Django form field for handling relative date/time deltas, including formatting and parsing functions.",
  "sources": "Input values received through form submissions that are passed to to_python() and clean() methods.",
  "sinks": "The code calls parse_relativedelta and format_relativedelta functions, which are external utility functions; these are assumed to handle data transformation, not security-sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from user input into to_python() and clean() methods, where parsing occurs, then potentially formatted via prepare_value() for display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code constructs, and no evident obfuscation. Exception handling is broad but typical for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code extends Django's CharField to handle relative date/time intervals, using utility functions for parsing and formatting. It manages exceptions gracefully, raising ValidationError on invalid formats. The code appears standard, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious external calls. There are no hardcoded secrets, network communications, or data exfiltration mechanisms. External utility functions are not included, so their behavior cannot be assessed, but they are presumably safe parsing/formatting functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward extension of a Django form field for relative date/time intervals. It does not contain malicious code or security risks based on the provided snippet. Its design focuses on input validation and formatting, with no signs of malware or suspicious activity.",
