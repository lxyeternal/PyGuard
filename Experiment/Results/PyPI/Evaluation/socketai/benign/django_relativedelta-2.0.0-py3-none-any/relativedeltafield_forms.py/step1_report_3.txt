  "purpose": "Custom Django form field for parsing and formatting relative date/time intervals using ISO8601 extended format.",
  "sources": "Input data from form submissions via the to_python and clean methods, which accept user input.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct output or system calls; data is processed internally.",
  "flows": "User input -> to_python/clean methods -> parse_relativedelta function -> output or exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs observed. Functions parse_relativedelta and format_relativedelta are external; their implementations are unknown but likely standard parsing/formatting routines.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom form field that converts string input into a relative delta object and formats such objects back into string form. The prepare_value method formats the value for display. The to_python method parses the string input into a data structure, and clean validates and re-parses the data, raising a ValidationError if invalid. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. External functions are used for parsing and formatting, which are presumed standard and safe unless proven otherwise. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a custom form field for handling relative date/time intervals, with no malicious behavior or security risks apparent. It primarily sanitizes and formats user input using external utility functions. The overall risk is low.",
