  "purpose": "Define a custom form field for handling relative delta inputs in Django forms, parsing and formatting relativedelta objects.",
  "sources": "Input values for the form field, specifically the 'value' parameter in to_python and clean methods.",
  "sinks": "parse_relativedelta and format_relativedelta functions, which process input and produce formatted output.",
  "flows": "Input value -> to_python or clean methods -> parse_relativedelta -> output; prepare_value -> format_relativedelta -> formatted value",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling without specific error management; reliance on external functions whose security is unknown. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django form field subclass that formats and parses relativedelta objects using external utility functions. It handles user input by converting it into a relativedelta object and formats internal values for display. The exception handling is generic, but it only raises validation errors when parsing fails, which is standard. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Usage appears consistent with form field validation and formatting, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a custom Django form field for relativedelta objects. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The use of external utility functions is typical and not suspicious. Overall, the code is safe based on the provided snippet.",
