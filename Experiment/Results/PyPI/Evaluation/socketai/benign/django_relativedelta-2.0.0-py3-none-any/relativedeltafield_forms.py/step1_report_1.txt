{
  "purpose": "Define a custom Django form field for handling relative date/time intervals in ISO8601 format.",
  "sources": "The class methods parse_relativedelta and format_relativedelta imported from relativedeltafield.utils, used to parse and format input values.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly write untrusted data to external systems or execute code with untrusted input. Potential risks could arise if parse_relativedelta or format_relativedelta are malicious or vulnerable, but these are assumed to be safe utility functions.",
  "flows": "Input value provided to to_python or clean methods flows through parse_relativedelta; prepare_value uses format_relativedelta to process the value before display.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses broad exception handling without specifying exception types in prepare_value, which might mask errors. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs are present. The utility functions are external, and their security depends on their implementation, but that cannot be assessed here.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom Django form field that converts user input into a relative delta object using parse_relativedelta. It formats data for display with format_relativedelta. Exception handling is broad but only raises validation errors or returns the original value. There are no hardcoded credentials, system calls, or suspicious network activity. The functions used are presumably safe utility functions. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a custom form field for parsing and formatting relative date/time intervals. It relies on external utility functions whose security cannot be confirmed but are assumed to be safe. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from the code itself.",
