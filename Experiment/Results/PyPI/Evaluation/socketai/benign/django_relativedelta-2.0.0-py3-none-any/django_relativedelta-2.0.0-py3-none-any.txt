      "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django admin customization snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as benign configuration code. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified due to its configuration nature. No further action needed."

      "confidence": 0.95,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented custom Django field for relativedelta objects, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified based on the analysis. External utility functions should be reviewed separately for security, but within this context, the code appears safe."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for handling ISO8601 durations, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The slight security concern relates to regex pattern permissiveness, which could be exploited for performance issues but not malicious activity. The 'self' parameter in 'relativedelta_as_csv' appears to be a typo or incomplete snippet, not malicious. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use with minor considerations for regex performance."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation with low security risk. No malware or obfuscation detected. The reliance on external utilities is a minor concern but does not elevate risk significantly. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
