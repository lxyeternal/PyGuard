  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The code only modifies Django admin configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version and imports necessary modules, including a specific Django admin options dictionary. It then assigns a custom form class (RelativeDeltaFormField) to the RelativeDeltaField in the Django admin default form field options. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no execution of dynamic code, no network operations, and no manipulation of environment variables. The code’s sole purpose is to enhance admin form behavior by linking a custom form class to a custom model field, which is standard practice in Django projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard configuration code for a Django application. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious logic, or security risks. The code’s intent is to register a custom form field for a specific model field in the admin interface, which is typical and safe.",
