  "purpose": "Configure a custom form field for a Django model field in a package's setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from Django and local modules, assignment to a Django default options dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to FORMFIELD_FOR_DBFIELD_DEFAULTS[RelativeDeltaField], which affects form rendering in Django admin.",
  "flows": "Importing RelativeDeltaField and RelativeDeltaFormField, then assigning form class to Django admin defaults for that field.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious data handling or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Django admin options and local module classes. It then sets a default form class for a custom model field, which is a common pattern in Django apps to customize admin interface behavior. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward configuration code without external data sources or sink functions that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a typical Django configuration to associate a custom form with a model field in the admin interface. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
