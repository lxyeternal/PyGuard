  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines a version string.\n- Imports Django admin options and custom modules.\n- Assigns a custom form class (`RelativeDeltaFormField`) to the default form mapping for `RelativeDeltaField` in Django's admin form defaults.\n\n**Presence of issues:**\n- The code is straightforward configuration code, with no dynamic execution, no user input handling, no external network activity, and no obfuscated or suspicious code.\n- The import statements are standard.\n- The assignment modifies a Django default options dictionary, which is a common pattern for customizing admin forms.\n\n**Logical and security considerations:**\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.\n- No evidence of obfuscation.\n- The purpose is to enhance admin interface behavior, which is a typical and safe practice.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n\n| Report # | Malware Score | Security Risk | Obfuscated | Reasoning & Justification |\n|------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| 1          | 0               | 0              | 0            | The report correctly identifies this as standard Django configuration. No malicious activity or security risks. The malware score of 0 is appropriate. |\n| 2          | 0               | 0              | 0            | Same reasoning; this is typical configuration code with no malicious intent. Malware and security risk scores are appropriate. |\n| 3          | 0               | 0              | 0            | Same as above; standard pattern, no issues. |\n| 4          | 0               | 0.1            | 0            | Slightly elevated security risk score (0.1) is perhaps overly cautious, as the code does not introduce any security concern. It’s just configuration. The malware score remains 0. |\n| 5          | 0               | 0.1            | 0            | Same as report 4; the minor security risk score might be a conservative estimate, but given the code's nature, it remains safe. Malware score stays at 0. |\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made.\n- The minor security risk scores (0.1) in reports 4 and 5 seem conservative but not unreasonable, considering they are just configuration snippets.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is standard Django admin customization.\n- No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no security risks beyond negligible defaults.\n- Malware score should remain at 0.\n- Security risk score can stay at 0 or be marginally increased to 0.1 if desired, but given the benign nature, 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Security risk score:** 0 (safe configuration with no vulnerabilities)\n\nThis aligns with the overall consensus that this code is benign and typical for Django projects.",
