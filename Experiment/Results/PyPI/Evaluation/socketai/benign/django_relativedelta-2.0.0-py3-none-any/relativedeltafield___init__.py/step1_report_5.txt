  "flows": "Importing modules -> modifying Django default form field mappings for RelativeDeltaField -> usage in Django form processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior; standard pattern for extending Django forms.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Django components and local custom field/form classes. It then updates the Django default form field mapping for RelativeDeltaField, linking it to RelativeDeltaFormField. This is a typical pattern for customizing admin forms in Django. No external data inputs, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The code structure and usage are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration snippet for customizing Django admin form behavior. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is safe and typical for Django projects.",
