  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django admin customization snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as benign configuration code. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified due to its configuration nature. No further action needed."
