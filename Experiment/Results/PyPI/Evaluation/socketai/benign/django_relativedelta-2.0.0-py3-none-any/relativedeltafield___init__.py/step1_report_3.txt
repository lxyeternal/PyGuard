  "purpose": "Configure a Django admin form field for a custom model field.",
  "sources": "Importing module attributes, accessing a global dictionary for Django form field defaults.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to the FORMFIELD_FOR_DBFIELD_DEFAULTS dictionary, which affects form rendering in Django admin.",
  "flows": "The code reads the RelativeDeltaField class and assigns a form class to its default form representation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious code patterns. Usage of Django form defaults is standard for custom fields.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a default form class for a custom model field (RelativeDeltaField) in Django admin. It imports the necessary components, then updates the FORMFIELD_FOR_DBFIELD_DEFAULTS dictionary to associate the field with a custom form class. This is a typical pattern in Django for customizing admin forms. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code. The imports are standard, and the assignment is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django pattern for associating a custom form class with a custom model field. There is no malicious behavior, no anomalies suggestive of security risks, and the code appears to be legitimate configuration code.",
