  "sources": "Import statements for Django admin options, custom fields, and forms; assignment to FORMFIELD_FOR_DBFIELD_DEFAULTS dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to FORMFIELD_FOR_DBFIELD_DEFAULTS[RelativeDeltaField], affecting admin form behavior.",
  "flows": "Source: import statements and the assignment statement; Sink: the modification of Django's default form options for RelativeDeltaField.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; straightforward configuration code with no dynamic execution, external data, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Django admin options and custom modules, then assigns a custom form class to the default form options for RelativeDeltaField. It is a standard pattern for customizing Django admin forms. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The minimal security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports is appropriate given the benign nature of the code, which only modifies default form behavior without external inputs or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django admin customization snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as benign configuration code. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified due to its configuration nature. No further action needed.",
