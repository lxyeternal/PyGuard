  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented custom Django field for relativedelta objects, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified based on the analysis. External utility functions should be reviewed separately for security, but within this context, the code appears safe."
