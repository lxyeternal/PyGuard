  "purpose": "Custom Django model field for storing and handling relativedelta objects, including parsing, formatting, and database interactions.",
  "sources": "Data input via field assignment; database retrieval and storage; external utility functions for parsing and formatting relativedelta objects.",
  "sinks": "Database storage (via get_db_prep_value); data retrieval (via from_db_value); validation errors raised during parsing.",
  "flows": "Input data -> parse_relativedelta (external function) -> stored in model attribute -> formatted via format_relativedelta or relativedelta_as_csv for database storage -> retrieved from database -> parsed again for Python use.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Exception handling is appropriate. External functions are assumed safe; no network or system calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom Django field for relativedelta objects, with methods for parsing, formatting, and database compatibility. It handles different database backends, especially PostgreSQL, with appropriate data types and SQL functions. Exception handling ensures invalid data raises validation errors. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or external malicious calls are evident. The reliance on external utility functions is standard; their security depends on their implementation, but no issues are apparent from this code. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with best practices for custom Django fields.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented custom Django field for relativedelta objects, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified based on the analysis. External utility functions should be reviewed separately for security, but within this context, the code appears safe.",
