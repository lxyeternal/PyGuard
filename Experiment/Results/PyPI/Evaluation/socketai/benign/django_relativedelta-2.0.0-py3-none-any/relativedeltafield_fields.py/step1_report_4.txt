{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom Django model field for storing and handling relative date intervals using relativedelta objects, supporting PostgreSQL and other databases.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include values assigned to the model field, database retrievals, and external dependencies such as parse_relativedelta and relativedelta_as_csv functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include database storage (db_type, get_db_prep_value), serialization (value_to_string), and exception handling (ValidationError).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input assignments or database fetches, through parsing and formatting functions, to database storage or retrieval, with validation and conversion steps.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code uses standard Django practices and external utility functions for parsing and formatting relativedelta objects. Exception handling appears appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom Django model field for relativedelta objects, with methods for database preparation, parsing, and serialization. It handles different database backends and formats data accordingly. No code injections, suspicious network activities, or malicious behaviors are evident. The use of external functions for parsing and formatting seems legitimate. Exception handling and validation are in place, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a legitimate custom Django field implementation for handling relativedelta objects. It does not contain malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. The code follows standard patterns, with no suspicious anomalies detected.",
