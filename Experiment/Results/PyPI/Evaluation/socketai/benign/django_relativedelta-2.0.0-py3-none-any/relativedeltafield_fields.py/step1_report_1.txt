  "purpose": "Custom Django model field for storing and handling relativedelta objects with database integration.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, class initializations, and methods that process and store relativedelta data.",
  "sinks": "Methods that convert data for database storage, and error handling that may raise exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input data is parsed and validated in __get__, to_python, get_db_prep_value; stored in __dict__; retrieved via __get__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls observed. Use of custom parsing functions and database-specific formatting is standard but warrants validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom Django model field for relativedelta objects, handling conversion, validation, and database compatibility. It uses standard parsing, formatting, and translation functions. No evidence of malicious code, external data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. Functions are focused on data handling and format conversion. No obfuscated language features or suspicious patterns are present. The use of parsing and formatting functions appears legitimate and consistent with expected behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a standard custom Django field for relativedelta objects without malicious intent. No suspicious behaviors or malware indications are detected. The code maintains data integrity and handles database-specific formatting securely.",
