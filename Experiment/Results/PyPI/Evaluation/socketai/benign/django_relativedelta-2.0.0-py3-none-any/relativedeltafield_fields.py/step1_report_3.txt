{
  "purpose": "Custom Django model field for storing and handling relativedelta objects with database compatibility.",
  "sources": "Imports from django, relativedeltafield.utils, and the code's internal methods and attributes.",
  "sinks": "Database query and save operations, parsing functions, and exception handling potentially interacting with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input data from database or external sources flows through parsing and formatting functions, possibly involving user-provided values, then stored or retrieved.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation. Use of dynamic methods like `__get__` and `__set__` is standard for descriptors. Custom formatting and parsing are straightforward. No suspicious network or system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom Django field for relativedelta objects, with methods for database serialization/deserialization, including PostgreSQL-specific interval handling. It utilizes safe parsing functions imported from utils and handles exceptions properly. No untrusted data sources or sinks that could lead to injection or data leakage are evident. The code does not perform any network activity, file operations, or system commands. It follows standard practices for custom Django fields and does not include obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured custom Django field implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It handles data formatting, parsing, and database compatibility in a typical manner without introducing vulnerabilities.",
