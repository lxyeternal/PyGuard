  "purpose": "Static analysis tool to detect usage of printf-style string formatting ('%') in Python AST nodes.",
  "sources": "AST nodes where BinOp with ast.Mod operator is used, specifically string or bytes literals on the left side.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "AST traversal from BinOp nodes with string/bytes literals and '%' operator; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward pattern detection with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an AST visitor that records locations of binary operations where string formatting with '%' is used. It then yields these locations along with a message. The logic is simple, safe, and intended for static code analysis. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The code relies solely on static AST pattern matching, with no external data handling or network activity. The purpose is benign, and the implementation is clear and correct.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility for detecting printf-style string formatting in Python code. It contains no malicious payloads, no obfuscation, and poses no security threat. The reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
