  "purpose": "The code analyzes Python AST to detect usage of printf-style string formatting with the modulo operator.",
  "sources": "Reads the AST of provided Python code during instantiation of the Plugin class.",
  "sinks": "Yields information about lines where printf-style string formatting occurs, which can be used for further analysis or reporting.",
  "flows": "AST traversal by Visitor to identify BinOp nodes with Mod operator and string or bytes literals, then reports their positions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors detected. The code performs static analysis without executing external data or system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system and importlib modules to determine version info. Defines a Visitor class that inspects AST nodes for string formatting patterns using the '%' operator. The Plugin class encapsulates the analysis, visiting the AST and yielding line and column info where printf-style formatting is used. The code appears to serve a benign purpose related to static code analysis. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are evident. It is a focused analysis tool without external data transmission or system modification capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a static analysis to identify printf-style string formatting in Python code. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is benign, aiming to help detect potential security issues related to string formatting practices.",
