{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse Python ASTs to identify use of '%' string formatting operations, likely for code analysis or linting purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module name for version info, and processes an AST node passed during initialization.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any direct sinks that handle untrusted data; it mainly inspects AST nodes for specific patterns.",
  "flows": "The AST is analyzed for binary operations, specifically '%'-based string formatting, with no data flow to external sinks or outputs involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard AST traversal and version detection, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a visitor class to detect '%' string formatting in AST nodes, specifically binary operations where the left side is a string or bytes. It then uses this visitor within a Plugin class, which receives an AST and yields locations where such formatting occurs, along with a warning message. The use of importlib.metadata to get version info is standard. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling is present. The code appears to serve a benign static analysis purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static analysis tool that detects '%' string formatting in Python code. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks and is intended for code inspection purposes.",
