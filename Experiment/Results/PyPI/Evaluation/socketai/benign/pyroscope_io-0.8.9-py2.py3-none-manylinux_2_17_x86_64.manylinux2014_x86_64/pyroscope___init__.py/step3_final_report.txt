  "purpose": "Wrapper around a native profiling library ('lib') for configuring, managing, and tagging a profiling agent.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to 'lib.initialize_agent', threading.get_ident() for thread tagging, environment variables, and input data like tokens, credentials, headers.",
  "sinks": "Encoding of sensitive data (tokens, credentials, headers) before passing to native functions; no direct sinks like network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (tokens, credentials, headers) are encoded and passed to native functions; thread IDs are used for tagging; no external network or file flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Use of warnings for deprecated features is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK wrapper that encodes parameters and interacts with an external native library. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The native library's trustworthiness is outside this code's scope but is not suspicious here. The code handles sensitive data properly and uses standard practices for threading and warnings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK wrapper for profiling purposes, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects reliance on external native code but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is zero, and obfuscation is absent.",
