{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a CFFI (C Foreign Function Interface) object for interacting with native code, likely for performance or system integration.",
  "sources": "Imports '_cffi_backend' module and calls its 'FFI' constructor with specific parameters, including version, types, globals, enums, and type names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only sets up native bindings and global variables.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing a backend module to creating an FFI object with predefined data structures and global variables; no data from external sources is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "The code is auto-generated, contains raw binary data, and defines internal structures without any obvious malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static initialization of a CFFI interface, typical for Python modules that interface with native libraries. It imports a backend, defines a set of types, globals, enums, and type names, likely for use elsewhere in the package. There is no dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no network communication. The presence of binary blobs is consistent with native binding setup. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The structure and purpose are typical for binding setup code, with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an auto-generated setup for native library interfacing via CFFI. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard initialization code snippet with no apparent security concerns.",
