  "purpose": "Auto-generated CFFI setup for native extension binding, loading static binary data and type definitions.",
  "sources": "Embedded binary data strings and static type/global/enumeration definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no external communication, no data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Initialization of the FFI object with static data; no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of binary blobs and obfuscated-looking data, typical in generated bindings but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated setup for native extension interfacing using _cffi_backend. It contains no user input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The embedded binary data and type definitions are standard for such bindings. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation intended to hide malicious intent are present. The obfuscation score reflects typical binary blobs, not malicious obfuscation. The malware score is zero, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, auto-generated native binding setup with no malicious or security concerns. It is standard for extension modules and does not pose any threat.",
