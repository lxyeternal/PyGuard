  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is an auto-generated CFFI setup with static data, no dynamic or external inputs, no suspicious code segments, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.0\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign, standard native binding code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, auto-generated CFFI binding with embedded binary data, no malicious activity, no external data flows, low obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0.2, Risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Likely benign, minor obfuscation but no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, auto-generated native extension setup, with embedded data, no external interactions, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0.2, Risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** No security concern, typical auto-generated code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar pattern, static initialization, no external data, no malicious activity, obfuscation minimal.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0.2, Risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Safe, standard native binding code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, auto-generated, static data, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity. The code is purely for native extension interfacing, with no network, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Minor obfuscation due to binary blobs and auto-generation, but not malicious or intentionally hidden.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, as all reports agree there's no active security risk.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is auto-generated, static, and intended for native library interfacing.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or exploits.\n- The embedded binary data and obfuscation are typical for generated bindings, not malicious code.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable given the evidence.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2 (minor obfuscation typical of auto-generated code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (negligible security risk, standard setup code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, auto-generated binding code for native extensions, with no security concerns.",
