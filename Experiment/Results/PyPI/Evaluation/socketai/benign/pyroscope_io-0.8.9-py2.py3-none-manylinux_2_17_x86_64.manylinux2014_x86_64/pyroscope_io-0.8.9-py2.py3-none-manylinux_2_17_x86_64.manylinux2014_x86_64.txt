      "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, with no malicious intent detected. The use of wildcard import introduces a minor security concern but does not constitute malicious behavior. The scores across reports are justified and consistent with the analysis. No significant revisions are necessary; the main consideration is cautious use of wildcard imports and ensuring package integrity."

The low risk score reflects reliance on external native code but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is zero, and obfuscation is absent."

The main security risk depends on the integrity of the shared library, which cannot be assessed from this snippet. Ensuring the library's source and verifying its integrity would mitigate potential supply chain risks."
