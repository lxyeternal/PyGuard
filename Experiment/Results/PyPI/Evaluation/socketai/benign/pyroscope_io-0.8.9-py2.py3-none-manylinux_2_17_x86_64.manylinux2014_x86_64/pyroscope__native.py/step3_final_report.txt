  "purpose": "Load a native shared library using ffi.dlopen from the same directory as the current file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file's directory via __file__ and constructs a path to the shared library '_native__lib.cpython-39-x86_64-linux-gnu.so'.",
  "sinks": "The shared library is loaded into memory; if compromised, it could execute malicious native code upon loading.",
  "flows": "The code constructs the path from __file__, then passes it to ffi.dlopen with mode 2, leading to the library being loaded into the process.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no obfuscation, input validation, or integrity checks are present. The mode parameter '2' (likely RTLD_NOW) is explicitly used but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a native shared library dynamically from a relative path based on __file__, using standard patterns. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of the shared library, not the code itself. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate, reflecting low but non-zero risk due to external native code loading without validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical auto-generated loader for a native library, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The main security risk depends on the integrity of the shared library, which cannot be assessed from this snippet. Ensuring the library's source and verifying its integrity would mitigate potential supply chain risks.",
