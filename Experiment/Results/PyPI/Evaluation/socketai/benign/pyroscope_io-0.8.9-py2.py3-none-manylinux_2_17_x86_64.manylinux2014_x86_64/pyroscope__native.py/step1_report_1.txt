{
  "purpose": "Load a native shared library using ffi from a specified path, likely for interfacing with lower-level code.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__) and __file__ for the file path; imported ffi object from pyroscope._native__ffi",
  "sinks": "ffi.dlopen call which loads a shared object file (.so) dynamically; potential for malicious shared library if the filename or path is manipulated",
  "flows": "The code constructs a file path based on the current file's directory, then loads a shared library using ffi.dlopen",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded shared object filename '_native__lib.cpython-39-x86_64-linux-gnu.so' could be suspicious if the filename is manipulated; no validation or integrity checks on the shared library; no obvious malicious behavior but dynamic loading of native code warrants caution",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, primarily dynamically loading a native shared library from a relative path. It uses __file__ to determine the current directory, constructs a path to a specific shared object file, and loads it with ffi.dlopen. No user input or external data sources are involved; the filename is hardcoded. While the code itself does not exhibit malicious behavior, the dynamic loading of native code can be a risk if the shared object is malicious or tampered with, especially since no integrity checks are performed. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and primarily for loading a native shared library. It does not contain malicious behavior on its own, but the use of dynamic native library loading warrants caution. No malicious intent detected, but the security risk depends on the integrity of the shared library being loaded.",
