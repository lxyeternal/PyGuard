  "purpose": "Load a native shared library for use within the Python package, likely for performance or native extension purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file path (__file__) to locate and load a shared object file (.so).",
  "sinks": "Loading the shared library using ffi.dlopen, which could potentially execute malicious code if the shared object is tampered with.",
  "flows": "os.path.join(__file__) -> ffi.dlopen()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The comment indicates auto-generation, which is common in build processes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' and a native extension 'pyroscope._native__ffi'. It constructs a file path to a shared object file based on the current file location and loads it using ffi.dlopen. The use of __file__ is standard for locating related native libraries. The comment suggests this file is auto-generated, likely part of a build process. No evident malicious behavior or anomalies are present. The shared library could contain native code, but there's no indication it is malicious based solely on this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical pattern for loading native libraries in Python extensions. There is no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior in this snippet. The main consideration is that if the shared object file is compromised, it could execute malicious code, but this is an inherent risk with native libraries rather than an issue with this code itself.",
