  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of a minimal import statement used for compatibility, with no suspicious behavior or malicious code.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from pyroscope import *' or 'import pyroscope' executed at module load time.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communications; import executes package initialization code, which could run malicious payloads if compromised.",
  "flows": "Import statement triggers package code execution during module load; no further data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*'), which can obscure imported symbols and potentially import malicious code if the package is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with comments indicating legacy support or compatibility. Importing a package executes its initialization code, which could be malicious if the package is compromised. Wildcard import is discouraged but not inherently malicious. No evidence of obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2-0.3) are appropriate given the potential risks associated with package import practices, especially wildcard imports. Confidence in the benign nature of the code is high, but the inherent risks of external package imports justify a slight elevation in security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, with no malicious intent detected. The use of wildcard import introduces a minor security concern but does not constitute malicious behavior. The scores across reports are justified and consistent with the analysis. No significant revisions are necessary; the main consideration is cautious use of wildcard imports and ensuring package integrity.",
