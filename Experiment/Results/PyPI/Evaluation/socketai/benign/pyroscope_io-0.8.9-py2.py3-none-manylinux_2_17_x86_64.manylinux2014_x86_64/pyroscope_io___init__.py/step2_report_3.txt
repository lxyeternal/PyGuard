  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippets, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All snippets are minimal, consisting solely of import statements.\n- The comments indicate compatibility or legacy reasons.\n- No data flows, user inputs, or external communications are present.\n- The only potential concern is the import of external packages, which can execute code during import.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Importing 'pyroscope' for compatibility; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected. The code is benign.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on no untrusted data sinks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues. The minimal import is safe.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Importing entire package, potential risk if package is malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.3, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.6\n- **Analysis:** While importing a package always carries some risk, the code itself is benign. The comment indicates legacy support, not malicious intent.\n- **Justification:** The securityRisk score of 0.3 is reasonable given the potential for malicious code in the package, but no actual malicious activity is observed. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate unless malicious code is present in the package itself.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep the scores as is; they appropriately reflect the potential risk without evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Import for profiling; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Wildcard import ('from pyroscope import *'), which can hide imported symbols and is generally discouraged.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.7\n- **Analysis:** The wildcard import is a code smell but not inherently malicious. The securityRisk score of 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting the potential for hidden or malicious symbols being imported.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious code. The risk is primarily due to the import style, not content.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusions:\n- **Malware scores:** All are correctly low (0), as no malicious code is evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Correctly zero; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly higher in Report 3 and 5, which is justified given the potential risks associated with importing external packages and wildcard imports, respectively.\n- **Confidence levels:** Appropriately assigned based on the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the minimal code snippets and comments, and the lack of any suspicious behavior, **my estimated scores** would be:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.3 (or 0.2-0.3) |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.2 (or 0.3) |\n\nThe current scores align well with this reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- No code present is malicious.\n- The security risk scores for importing entire packages or wildcard imports are reasonable.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed unless further code context suggests otherwise.\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the context of the package's contents and source. In this case, the minimal snippets and comments support a benign interpretation.",
