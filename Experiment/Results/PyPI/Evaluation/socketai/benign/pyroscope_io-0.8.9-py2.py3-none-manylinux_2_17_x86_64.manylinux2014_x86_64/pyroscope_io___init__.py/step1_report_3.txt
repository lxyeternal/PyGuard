  "purpose": "Importing all functionalities from the pyroscope package for compatibility with previous versions.",
  "sources": "The import statement from the pyroscope package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows observable; only a package import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates backward compatibility, but the import could potentially load code with malicious intent if the package is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all functions and classes from the 'pyroscope' package, which could execute arbitrary code depending on the package's contents. The comment suggests legacy support for an older package name. There are no other operations, user inputs, or data handling shown. The minimal code limits analysis, but the act of importing a package always involves executing its initialization code, which could be malicious if the package is compromised. The comment hints at legacy code, but doesn't add any malicious behavior by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code imports an entire package, which, while common, can be risky if the package is malicious or compromised. The comment indicates legacy support, not malicious intent. No immediate malicious behavior is apparent, but reliance on external packages always carries some risk.",
