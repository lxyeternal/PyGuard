  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*'), which can hide imported symbols and potential malicious behavior, though not inherently malicious. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of an import statement, aiming for compatibility with previous versions of the package. The use of wildcard import ('from pyroscope import *') can be considered a code smell but is not malicious by itself. No data sources, sinks, or flows are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident from this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement for compatibility, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The only concern is the use of wildcard import, which is generally discouraged, but it does not indicate malicious activity.",
