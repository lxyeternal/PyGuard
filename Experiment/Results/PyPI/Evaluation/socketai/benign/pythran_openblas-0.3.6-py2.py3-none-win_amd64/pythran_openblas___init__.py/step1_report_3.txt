{
  "purpose": "Set up library file names and directory paths based on the operating system and directory structure.",
  "sources": "sys.platform for OS detection, os.path and os.path.isdir for directory and path information",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code only determines paths and filenames without executing or passing untrusted data to external systems",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are present; the code solely computes and assigns directory paths and filenames",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and appears to be standard setup logic.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system to assign the appropriate library filename. It then determines the current directory of the script, constructs a path to include directories, and checks for the existence of 'lib' or 'lib64' directories to set 'library_dir'. If neither directory exists, it raises an error. No suspicious or malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation detected. The logic appears to be a typical setup script for building or configuring native libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign setup routine for determining library file names and directories based on OS and directory structure. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
