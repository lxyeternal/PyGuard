  "purpose": "Determine library filenames and paths based on the operating system and directory structure for building or linking purposes.",
  "sources": "sys.platform, os.path.dirname(__file__), os.path.isdir(), os.path.join()",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, but the code sets variables that could be used in build/link processes",
  "flows": "sys.platform -> static_library; __dir__ -> include_dirs, library_dir",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically sets library filenames based on the platform. It determines include directories and library paths based on the directory structure relative to the current file. No network operations, data leaks, or malicious activity are present. The logic is straightforward and typical for build setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard setup script for configuring library paths and filenames depending on the platform and directory layout. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
