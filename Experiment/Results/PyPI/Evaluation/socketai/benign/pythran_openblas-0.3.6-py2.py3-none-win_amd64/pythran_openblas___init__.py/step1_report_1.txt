{
  "purpose": "Determine the appropriate library file based on the operating system and set include and library directories for building or linking a library.",
  "sources": "Reading system platform information via sys.platform, checking directory existence with os.path.isdir, and deriving directory paths using os.path.dirname and os.path.join.",
  "sinks": "None that directly lead to data leak or malicious action; primarily filesystem checks and path manipulations.",
  "flows": "The code uses sys.platform to choose between different library files, then checks for the existence of specific directories to set library paths.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic are present. The code performs standard environment and filesystem checks.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically selects a library filename based on the operating system and verifies the existence of library directories to set paths. These are typical operations in build scripts. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system modifications, is evident. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a build or configuration process without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard environment detection and path setup for building or linking external libraries. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
