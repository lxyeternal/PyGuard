  "sources": "sys.platform, os.path.dirname(__file__), os.path.isdir, os.path.join",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used in a way that affects security or leaks data.",
  "flows": "sys.platform → static_library assignment; __dir__ → include_dirs and library_dir determination",
  "anomalies": "Trailing comma in 'include_dirs' assignment causes it to be a singleton tuple instead of a string path, likely an unintended bug.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system to assign the correct static library filename. It then determines the current directory and sets include and library directories based on filesystem checks. The only anomaly is the trailing comma in 'include_dirs', which makes it a tuple, potentially causing runtime errors. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The filesystem checks are standard and do not involve untrusted input. The code's purpose is typical for build scripts, with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign build configuration snippet that performs environment detection and path setup. The only issue is a minor bug (trailing comma) that could cause runtime errors but poses no security risk or malicious intent. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0. The minor bug could be fixed for correctness but does not impact security.",
