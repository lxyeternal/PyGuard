  "anomalies": [
    "Use of __file__ for directory paths; common but should verify execution context.",
    "No validation or sanitization of directory paths, but no immediate security concern as paths are derived from filesystem structure."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code detects the OS platform to select the appropriate static library filename. It then determines include and library directories based on the current file's location, checking for standard 'lib' or 'lib64' directories. The logic is straightforward and does not involve processing untrusted input or executing external commands. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present. The code's behavior is limited to setting variables based on OS and directory structure, with no apparent malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple configuration script for setting up library paths based on the OS and directory structure. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It performs standard filesystem checks and path assignments typical of build or configuration scripts.",
