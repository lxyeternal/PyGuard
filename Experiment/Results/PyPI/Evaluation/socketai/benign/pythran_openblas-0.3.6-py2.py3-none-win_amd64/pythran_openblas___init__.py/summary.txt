  "conclusion": "The script is a benign build configuration snippet that performs environment detection and path setup. The only issue is a minor bug (trailing comma) that could cause runtime errors but poses no security risk or malicious intent. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0. The minor bug could be fixed for correctness but does not impact security."
