  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an AWS CloudWatch logging handler with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal operational risk due to external dependencies and network interactions. The assessments across all reports are consistent and justified."
