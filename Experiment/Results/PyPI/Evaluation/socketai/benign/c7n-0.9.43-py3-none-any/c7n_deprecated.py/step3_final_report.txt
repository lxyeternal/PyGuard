{
  "purpose": "The code manages deprecation warnings, aliasing, renaming fields, optional fields, and generates reports with footnotes for policy elements.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from class attributes, method parameters, and internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "Generates textual reports, including formatted strings and footnotes; no external communication or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Source data (attributes, parameters) flows into report generation functions, with validation checks in 'check' methods, culminating in formatted report output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The 'check' methods perform straightforward validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured utility for managing deprecation notices, including aliasing, renaming, and optional fields. It performs internal data validation and report formatting without external system interaction. The 'check' methods validate presence or absence of fields, which is standard. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is clear, and the purpose is benign. The scores assigned in the provided reports (malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured deprecation management utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
