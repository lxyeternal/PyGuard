  "purpose": "The code appears to be a header comment indicating copyright information and license details for the Cloud Custodian project.",
  "sources": "None, as it is only a comment block and does not read any input or data.",
  "sinks": "None, no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, no executable code or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only comment lines; no executable code, functions, or logic to analyze.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet contains only comment headers specifying copyright ownership and licensing (Apache-2.0). There are no functions, code logic, or data processing present to analyze for security issues or malicious behavior. Since no executable or data handling code is included, the risk of malicious activity is effectively zero. This appears to be a standard license header, possibly part of a larger codebase, but in isolation, it does not present any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided comment header, there is no malicious behavior or security risk. The code is a simple license notice with no executable content.",
