  "purpose": "Define mappings and utilities for processing AWS CloudWatch and CloudTrail events for resource identification and event matching.",
  "sources": "Reads event data from event objects, mainly from the 'detail' key, and event configuration from class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data flows; data is used internally for resource ID extraction and matching.",
  "flows": "Event data flows from input to resource ID extraction functions, with no evidence of untrusted data influencing system commands or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic expression compilation and search via jmespath; no suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code structure is straightforward and appears legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with static mappings of AWS CloudTrail event names to resource identifiers and sources. It provides methods to match incoming event data with predefined event types, compile and cache jmespath expressions for efficient lookup, and extract resource IDs based on event details and configuration modes. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The usage of dynamic compilation for jmespath expressions is standard for performance optimization and does not pose security concerns. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for event processing within a cloud security tool, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate component for mapping and extracting resource identifiers from AWS CloudWatch and CloudTrail events.",
