{
  "purpose": "A utility class for mapping AWS CloudWatch and CloudTrail events to resource identifiers, compiling JMESPath expressions for efficient extraction, and providing methods to match events and retrieve resource IDs.",
  "sources": "Event data in 'detail' key, specifically 'eventName', 'eventSource', and resource-specific fields within 'requestParameters' or 'responseElements'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or perform data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Event data flows from input through matching and extraction functions, with compiled expressions used to search within event details, but no external data flow or malicious payload is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with dynamic compilation of expressions being standard practice and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code maps AWS CloudTrail event names to resource identifiers, compiles JMESPath expressions for efficiency, and provides methods to match events and extract resource IDs. It uses standard libraries and functions, with no network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code. The dynamic compilation of expressions is a common pattern for performance optimization. No hardcoded secrets or external dependencies are present. The logic is clear, and the code functions as intended for event processing. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for AWS event mapping and resource ID extraction. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the code is safe for use.",
