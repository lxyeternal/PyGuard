  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility for mapping AWS CloudWatch events, compiling JMESPath expressions, and extracting resource IDs. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. The low security risk score is appropriate, given the code's purpose.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard event parsing, caching of compiled expressions, and resource ID extraction. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The slight increase in securityRisk score (from 0.1 to 0.2) is justified, considering dynamic compilation, but still minimal. No malicious activity is suggested.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores seem consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, highlighting standard event mapping, resource extraction, and no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's functionality. The security risk remains low, and no malicious behavior is indicated.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the code's role in event mapping, resource ID extraction, and lack of suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** The zero security risk is justified; no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as previous, confirming the code's benign purpose.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None. The code is a standard AWS event parsing utility.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- **Security Risk Scores:** Slightly varied but justified, given the code's nature. No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Confidence Levels:** Appropriately high, reflecting thorough analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should stay at 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the context, a slightly conservative estimate would be around 0.1-0.2, aligning with the reports.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports, considering the code's benign nature but acknowledging minimal inherent risks in dynamic expression compilation)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. The code is a legitimate utility with no malicious or suspicious features.",
