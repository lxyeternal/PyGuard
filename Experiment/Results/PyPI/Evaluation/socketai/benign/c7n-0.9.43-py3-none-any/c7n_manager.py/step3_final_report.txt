{
  "purpose": "This code implements a resource management framework for Cloud Custodian, handling resource retrieval, filtering, serialization, and plugin loading.",
  "sources": "Configuration data, dynamic resource imports, filters, actions, and plugin registries.",
  "sinks": "JSON serialization via dumps, resource retrieval functions.",
  "flows": "Input configuration data flows into filters and resource managers; filters process resources; resources are serialized or retrieved as needed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation; use of dynamic plugin loading is standard but could be exploited if malicious plugins are added.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard resource management framework with clear structure and no malicious behavior. The dynamic plugin loading pattern is common but presents a potential attack surface if malicious plugins are introduced. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's content and typical practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score appropriately reflects the inherent plugin architecture risk but does not indicate active threats.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
