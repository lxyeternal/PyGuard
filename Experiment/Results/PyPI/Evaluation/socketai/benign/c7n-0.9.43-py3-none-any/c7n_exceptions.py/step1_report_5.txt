{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors in the Cloud Custodian framework.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'ClientError' from 'botocore.exceptions'; usage of the 'format' method in the constructor of ResourceLimitExceeded.",
  "sinks": "The 'format' method in ResourceLimitExceeded could potentially be misused if 'msg' is untrusted, but it appears to be used internally with controlled strings.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data could flow from the 'msg' parameter in ResourceLimitExceeded to the formatted exception message, but 'msg' is intended for internal use with predefined strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; exception class definitions and standard import handling are typical.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, primarily for use within the Cloud Custodian project. It attempts to import 'ClientError' from 'botocore.exceptions' and provides a fallback dummy class if the import fails. The 'ResourceLimitExceeded' class formats an error message with various parameters, but this appears to be controlled by internal logic rather than external input. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated elements. The code is straightforward, primarily defining error types.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes for error handling in a framework, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
