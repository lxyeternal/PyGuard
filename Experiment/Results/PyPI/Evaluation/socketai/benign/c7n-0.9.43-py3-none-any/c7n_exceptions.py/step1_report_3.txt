  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Cloud Custodian project to handle various error conditions.",
  "sources": "Imports 'botocore.exceptions.ClientError' (possibly from external library), and internal class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external data output.",
  "flows": "Import and exception class instantiations; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of class definitions and a conditional import. The import of 'botocore.exceptions.ClientError' includes a fallback dummy class which is standard practice to prevent import errors, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a set of custom exception classes for error handling in a cloud policy framework. It attempts to import 'ClientError' from 'botocore.exceptions', but provides a dummy class if the import fails, which is a common pattern to ensure compatibility or avoid import errors. The exception classes are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, or any network or system calls. There is no indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The code appears to be well-structured, conventional, and free of obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions with a safe conditional import. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code's purpose is to facilitate error handling within a larger application, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
