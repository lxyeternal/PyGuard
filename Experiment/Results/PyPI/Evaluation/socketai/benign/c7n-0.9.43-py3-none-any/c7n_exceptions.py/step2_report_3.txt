  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is straightforward, defining exception classes with a conditional import for `ClientError`. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard exception classes with safe import handling. No external data or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct reasoning.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern, safe import fallback, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous, standard exception classes, safe import.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Slightly more attention to the `ResourceLimitExceeded` class, noting that `msg` could be untrusted but is used internally with controlled strings. No evidence of external data flow or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores are 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores are 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Since all code is standard exception handling with safe import fallback, the overall security risk is negligible. The highest risk score is 0, which aligns with the reports.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is standard exception class definitions with conditional imports, common in Python projects.\n- No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The use of a dummy class fallback for `ClientError` is a typical pattern, not suspicious.\n- The error handling and class structure are straightforward and well-understood.\n\n### **Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code. No modifications needed.",
