  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for error handling with a conditional import for ClientError.",
  "sources": "Import of 'ClientError' with fallback; internal usage of msg parameter in ResourceLimitExceeded.",
  "sinks": "None; exception classes are used for internal error reporting.",
  "flows": "Import and class instantiation; formatting of error message in ResourceLimitExceeded.",
  "anomalies": "Use of msg.format() in ResourceLimitExceeded is safe assuming msg is controlled internally.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard exception classes with a safe fallback for the optional import. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or external data handling are present. The formatting of error messages uses controlled strings, and the overall structure is straightforward. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for error handling, with no malicious activity or security issues. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
