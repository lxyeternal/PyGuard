  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Cloud Custodian project to handle various errors and errors related to policies and resources.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'ClientError' from 'botocore.exceptions' and local class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Exception classes are defined but do not include data sinks or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception classes are used for error handling and are not involved in data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward exception class definitions with a conditional import fallback; no suspicious or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an exception class from a third-party library with a fallback to a dummy class, then defines multiple custom exception classes for error handling within the Cloud Custodian framework. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or suspicious patterns are present. The code structure and logic are standard and align with common Python practices for error management. No signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of standard exception class definitions and a conditional import, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a typical, benign part of a larger codebase focused on error handling.",
