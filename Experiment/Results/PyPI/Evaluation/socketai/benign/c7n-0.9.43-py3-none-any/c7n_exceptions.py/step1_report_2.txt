  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in the Cloud Custodian project.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore.exceptions and internal class definitions.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising in ResourceLimitExceeded constructor.",
  "flows": "Input from import statements and usage of class inheritance and exception raising in constructor.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains exception class definitions and a try-except block for importing ClientError. The try-except gracefully handles missing dependencies by defining a dummy class. The custom exceptions are standard and used for error management. No input sources, external data handling, or sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious behavior are present. No suspicious patterns or malicious code are detected. The ResourceLimitExceeded class formats error messages and stores related attributes, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and solely defines exception classes for error handling in a larger system. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
