  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines exception classes; imports `ClientError` with fallback.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard pattern; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; exception classes and import handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; straightforward code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct scoring; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern; safe conditional import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar pattern; exception classes.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines exception classes; notes the use of `format`.\n- **Analysis:** The use of `format` on `msg` could be a concern if `msg` is untrusted. However, the report states that `msg` is intended for internal use with controlled strings, which minimizes risk.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** The scoring is reasonable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign exception class definitions with safe import handling.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors, malicious code, or obfuscation are detected.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are 0, which aligns with the benign nature. Risk scores are 0, which is appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- **Potential concerns:** The only minor point is the use of `format` with `msg` in `ResourceLimitExceeded`, but since `msg` is presumably controlled internally, this does not elevate risk.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's scoring is accurate and consistent with the code's content. The code is a standard, safe implementation of exception classes with conditional import handling, and no adjustments are necessary.",
