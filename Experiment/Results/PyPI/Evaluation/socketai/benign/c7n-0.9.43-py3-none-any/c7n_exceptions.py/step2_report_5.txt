  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of exception class definitions with a conditional import for `ClientError`.\n- No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or external data handling is present.\n- The import fallback pattern for `ClientError` is standard and safe.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, used for internal error handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The only potentially noteworthy point is the use of `msg.format()` in `ResourceLimitExceeded`, but it appears to be used with controlled inputs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious activity.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Logic or reasoning errors:** None identified. The code is straightforward class definitions and a safe import fallback.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5. Given the code is purely for error handling with no external or untrusted data, a score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The use of `msg.format()` in `ResourceLimitExceeded` is safe here because `msg` is an internal string, not untrusted input. No risk of injection or malicious formatting.\n- The fallback for `ClientError` is a common pattern, not suspicious.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- No changes needed; the scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The overall security posture is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with a conditional import pattern. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign and typical for error handling.  \n- No issues or vulnerabilities are present.  \n- Scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the true nature of the code.",
