  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Cloud Custodian project and handle optional imports.",
  "sources": "Import statement for botocore.exceptions.ClientError, class initializations, and exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow to untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "Import attempt to class definition and exception raising, but no external data or untrusted input flows are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code constructs, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation, straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for use within the Cloud Custodian project, including a conditional import for the 'ClientError' exception. The exception handling is safe, providing a dummy class if 'botocore' is unavailable. All code appears to be standard and intended for internal exception handling, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code. There are no indications of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class setup with safe conditional import logic. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and intended for internal error management.",
