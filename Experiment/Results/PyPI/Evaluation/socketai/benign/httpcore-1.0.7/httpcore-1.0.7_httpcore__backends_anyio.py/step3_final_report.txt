{
  "purpose": "Provides an asynchronous network backend supporting TCP and Unix sockets with optional TLS encryption, handling connection, reading, writing, and resource cleanup.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the network stream via receive(), reads socket attributes via get_extra_info(), and accesses socket options during connection setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed in a dangerous manner; socket options are set during connection, and data flows are typical for network communication.",
  "flows": "Source: network data received via receive() or socket attribute access; Sink: data sent via send(), socket options set during connection; flow is straightforward and standard.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of 'stream._raw_socket.setsockopt()' is standard socket configuration, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard async network backend with exception handling, TLS support, and socket configuration. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.2 are consistent with the code's behavior. The use of socket options is typical and controlled. No signs of supply chain attack, backdoors, or malicious activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured async network utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
