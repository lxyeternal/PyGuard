  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for network and protocol-related errors and a context manager to map exceptions.",
  "sources": "Exception handling within the context manager, class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising in the context manager's except block.",
  "flows": "Exceptions caught in the except block are potentially mapped to other exceptions or re-raised.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code appears to be standard exception handling setup.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a context manager that maps specific exceptions to other exception types, which is a common pattern for exception translation or handling. Multiple custom exception classes are defined for network, protocol, and timeout errors. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity embedded within the code. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code serves a typical purpose of structured error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception management for network-related errors and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a legitimate utility module with no security concerns.",
