  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for network and protocol errors and a context manager for exception mapping.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading sources present in the code).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data being processed or written).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow paths involving untrusted sources and sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard exception class definitions and a context manager for exception mapping.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of custom exception class definitions related to network and protocol errors, and a context manager that maps exceptions from one type to another. There are no suspicious functions, data handling, or external interactions. The code does not include any hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscation or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward utility module defining exceptions and an exception mapping context manager, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
