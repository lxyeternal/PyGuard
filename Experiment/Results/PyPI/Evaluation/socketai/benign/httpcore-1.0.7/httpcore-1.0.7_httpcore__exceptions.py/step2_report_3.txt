  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code defines a set of custom exception classes related to network, protocol, and timeout errors.\n   - It also provides a context manager `map_exceptions` that catches any exception within its scope and remaps it according to a provided mapping.\n   - The code appears to be a utility module for structured exception handling, with no external data processing, network calls, or obfuscated code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, standard, and benign.\n   - There are no logical flaws, suspicious patterns, or signs of malicious intent.\n   - The reports consistently note the absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious control flow.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are mostly 0 or very low (e.g., 0.1), which aligns with the benign assessment.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - The exception mapping pattern is common and safe.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since no malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns are present, risk scores should remain very low or zero.\n   - The malware score is correctly 0 in all reports, as no malicious activity is detected.\n   - The security risk scores are also appropriately low.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions and Claims:**\n   - All reports correctly challenge any unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent.\n   - They emphasize that the code is standard exception handling logic.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n   - No report suggests an inflated risk score; all are conservative and accurate.\n\n**My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign utility module for exception handling in network-related Python code. The reports are accurate, and their scoring reflects the actual security posture. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- The exception mapping pattern is common and safe.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
