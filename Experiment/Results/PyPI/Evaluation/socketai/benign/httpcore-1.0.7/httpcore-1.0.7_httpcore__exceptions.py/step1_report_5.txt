{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes and a context manager for mapping exceptions, primarily used for handling network and protocol errors in a Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads exception objects during error handling within the context manager and when exceptions are raised or caught.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could be the exception objects raised, but there are no external data inputs or outputs; exception raising is internal.",
  "flows": "Exceptions caught in the context manager may be mapped to different exceptions and re-raised; no external data flows or untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors; the exception classes are standard, and the context manager is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes related to network and protocol errors, and a context manager to map exceptions from one type to another. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The exception handling pattern is standard and does not contain any obfuscation or hidden actions. No external data sources or sinks are involved, and the code appears to be purely structural for error management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation of exception handling and custom exception classes for network operations. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for structured error management in network-related code.",
