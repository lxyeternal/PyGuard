  "purpose": "Define exception classes and a context manager for exception mapping related to network operations and protocols.",
  "sources": "Exception classes, the context manager function, and import statements",
  "sinks": "Exception raising within the context manager, particularly during exception handling",
  "flows": "Exceptions caught in 'map_exceptions' are potentially remapped based on provided mapping",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code sets up custom exception classes for network and protocol errors, including timeouts and connection issues. The 'map_exceptions' context manager allows remapping exceptions based on a provided mapping. The logic is straightforward: it catches any exception, then remaps or re-raises as needed. No external data sources, no suspicious control flow, no hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors. It appears to be a utility module for exception handling in network code, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility for exception handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs exception remapping in a controlled manner, with no hidden or suspicious activities.",
