  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and a context manager for exception mapping in network or protocol-related operations.",
  "sources": "Exception classes definitions and the 'map_exceptions' context manager that reads from the 'map' parameter.",
  "sinks": "Raising mapped exceptions inside the context manager upon catching any exception.",
  "flows": "Code executes within the 'map_exceptions' context; if an exception occurs, it is caught and potentially replaced with a different exception based on the mapping.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; exception handling is standard. No suspicious code flows or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines custom exception classes related to network and protocol errors, and a context manager that maps exceptions to different types. The 'map_exceptions' function yields control, then catches all exceptions, transforming or re-raising them according to a provided mapping. This pattern is typical for exception handling and does not involve any suspicious or malicious behavior. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are involved, nor are there any suspicious code flows, obfuscated constructs, or data leaks. The code appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions and a safe exception-mapping context manager. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or security risks. It is a standard utility pattern for exception handling in Python. Overall, this code is benign.",
