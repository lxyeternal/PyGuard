{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes related to network, protocol, and timeout errors, and provides a context manager for exception remapping.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions and the 'map_exceptions' context manager",
  "sinks": "Exception handling within the context manager, remapping exceptions based on provided mapping",
  "flows": "Any exception raised inside the 'map_exceptions' context is caught and potentially remapped to another exception type",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious control flow observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module for structured exception handling, with clearly defined exception classes and a context manager that remaps exceptions. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The exception remapping logic is standard, and the exception classes are typical for network-related error handling. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or contain hidden malicious behavior. All signals indicate benign, utility-focused code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for exception management, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assess its safety, and the scores are consistent with its benign nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
