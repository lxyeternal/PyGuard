  "purpose": "Provides functions for sending HTTP requests and streaming responses using a connection pool.",
  "sources": "User-provided input for method, url, headers, content, and extensions in request() and stream() functions.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted input data is directly passed to pool.request() and pool.stream() methods, which likely send HTTP requests.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (method, url, headers, content, extensions) flow directly into connection pool request and stream methods, which generate network requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of context managers and explicit parameters appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward request and streaming HTTP request functions utilizing a connection pool. Parameters from the user are directly used in network request calls without any apparent data manipulation, encoding, or risky operations. No code injection, dynamic execution, or suspicious data handling is present. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. The functions mainly act as wrappers around connection pool methods. The overall design and structure are typical for an HTTP client module, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an HTTP request utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It correctly manages resources and uses parameters securely by passing them directly to network request methods. No malware or security risks are evident.",
