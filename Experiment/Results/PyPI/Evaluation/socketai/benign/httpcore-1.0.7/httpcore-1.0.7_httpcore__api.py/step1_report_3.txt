{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for sending HTTP requests and streaming responses using a connection pool.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function parameters: method, url, headers, content, extensions.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the pool.request() and pool.stream() methods which send requests over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs (sources) to network request methods (sinks) via parameters passed through connection pool methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: request() for synchronous requests and stream() for streaming responses. Both use a context-managed connection pool to perform network requests. The parameters are standard for HTTP requests, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs. The functions do not perform data manipulation beyond request initiation. No suspicious network connections or hidden behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a standard implementation of an HTTP client interface with proper resource management and no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate HTTP request interface with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It adheres to best practices for resource management and parameter handling. No security risks are identified.",
