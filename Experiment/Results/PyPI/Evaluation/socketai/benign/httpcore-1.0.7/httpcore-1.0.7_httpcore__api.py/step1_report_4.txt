{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for sending HTTP requests and streaming responses, encapsulating connection pooling logic.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'method', 'url', 'headers', 'content', and 'extensions' are read from user-provided arguments.",
  "sinks": "The 'pool.request' and 'pool.stream' methods are sinks where the data flows to perform network communication, potentially sending untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters ('method', 'url', etc.) into 'pool.request'/'pool.stream' methods which execute network requests, returning 'Response' objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. Usage of context managers for connection pooling is standard. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'request' for sending HTTP requests and 'stream' for streaming responses. Both functions utilize a connection pool to manage network connections. Inputs are method, URL, headers, content, and extensions, which are passed directly to underlying network methods without any modifications or unsafe handling. No suspicious data handling, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are observed. The code appears to be a straightforward wrapper around network request functionalities, with proper resource management via context managers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of HTTP request handling with connection pooling. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It solely facilitates network communication in a typical manner.",
