{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to send HTTP requests and stream responses using a connection pool, acting as a simple HTTP client wrapper.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters: method, url, headers, content, extensions",
  "sinks": "Network request functions within pool.request() and pool.stream()",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly from function arguments into network request methods",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; straightforward parameter passing",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that wrap network request calls, passing user inputs directly into request methods managed by a connection pool. No malicious, backdoored, or obfuscated code is present. The code manages resources properly with context managers. The untrusted input flow is typical for an HTTP client library. No vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are identified. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.1), consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign HTTP request utility with no malicious or suspicious behaviors. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with its straightforward implementation. No further action or concern is warranted.",
