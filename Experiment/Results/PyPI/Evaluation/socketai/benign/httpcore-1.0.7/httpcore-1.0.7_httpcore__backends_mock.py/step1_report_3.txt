{
  "purpose": "The code provides mock implementations of network streams and backends, including synchronous and asynchronous variants, primarily for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from in-memory buffers (_buffer) during read operations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; no data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the in-memory buffer to read functions; no external data flow or network transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. The code is primarily mocking network behavior for testing. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mock classes for network streams and backends, including synchronous and asynchronous versions, intended for testing network interactions. It reads data solely from provided in-memory buffers, and no external or untrusted data sources are used. Write and sleep methods are no-ops, indicating simulation rather than real network activity. The get_extra_info method returns a mock SSL object, simulating SSL behavior. Overall, the code appears straightforward and intended for testing, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a testing utility implementing mock network streams and backends. It does not perform any malicious actions, contain backdoors, or leak data. The functions are purely for simulation, and there is no evidence of malware or security risks.",
