{
  "purpose": "The code provides mock classes for network streams and backends, used primarily for testing network interactions without performing real network operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from internal buffers within the mock stream classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no external sinks or untrusted data flows; write methods are no-ops and do not process external input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal buffers to read methods; no external data enters the system or affects external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present; the code is straightforward mock implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of mock classes simulating network streams and backends for both synchronous and asynchronous contexts. They operate solely on internal buffers, with methods like 'write' and 'sleep' being no-ops, indicating testing utilities. No external data, untrusted input, or network activity is involved. SSL info is simulated via mock objects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The purpose is clearly for testing, and the implementation aligns with that intent. The data flow is limited to internal buffers, and no external or untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing utility for network interactions, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, controlled environment for testing purposes.",
