{
  "purpose": "The code provides mock implementations of network streams and backends, primarily for testing or simulation purposes without real network activity.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the '_buffer' list in MockStream and AsyncMockStream objects during read operations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not write untrusted data elsewhere, nor does it interact with external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the '_buffer' list to the read methods of MockStream and AsyncMockStream. No external untrusted input flows into sensitive operations or external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses mock classes that simulate network streams; no actual network or system calls are made. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The 'write' and 'sleep' methods are effectively no-ops, which is normal for mocks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mock classes to simulate network streams and backends, including both synchronous and asynchronous variants. These classes return preset data from internal buffers and do not perform any real network activity or data manipulation. No suspicious or malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system tampering, is present. The use of mock classes for testing is standard and does not introduce security risks. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are detected. Overall, this code appears safe and intended solely for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements mock network streams and backends for testing, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not handle real user input or system data, and its functionality is limited to simulation. The code is standard for testing scenarios and shows no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
