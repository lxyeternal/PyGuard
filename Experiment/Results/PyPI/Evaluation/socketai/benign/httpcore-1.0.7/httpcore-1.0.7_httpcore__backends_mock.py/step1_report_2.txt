{
  "purpose": "This code provides mock classes for network streams and backends, primarily used for testing HTTP connections with optional HTTP/2 support, both synchronously and asynchronously.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'buffer' list in the MockStream and AsyncMockStream classes during read operations.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that handle untrusted data directly leading to data leaks or security effects. The code does not write untrusted data or perform network operations outside the mock environment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'buffer' list during read operations in MockStream and AsyncMockStream. There are no external input sources or untrusted data flows to other parts of the code or network.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains mock classes that simulate network streams and backends; these are standard for testing. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are apparent. The 'write' methods are no-ops, which is typical for mocks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mock classes that simulate network streams and backends for testing purposes. These classes manage internal buffers for reading data, simulate TLS setup, and provide SSL information via get_extra_info(). There are no external input sources or data handling that could lead to security risks or malicious activity. The absence of network operations or data exfiltration, combined with the nature of mock objects, indicates this code is intended solely for testing, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code consists of mock classes for testing HTTP network connections. It does not include malicious behavior or security risks. It is used for simulating network interactions in a controlled environment. No suspicious code or malicious activity is detected.",
