{
  "purpose": "This code provides mock implementations of network streams and backends for synchronous and asynchronous use, mainly for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Code reads no external input or untrusted data sources; it initializes buffers and HTTP/2 flags internally.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; methods do not perform data processing that affects system state or security.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve reading from internal buffers within mock streams; no external or untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors; it solely implements mock network interfaces for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mock classes for network streams and backends, both synchronous and asynchronous, used to simulate network communication. It includes methods for connecting TCP and Unix sockets, reading and writing data, starting TLS, and getting SSL info. All methods perform straightforward operations, mainly handling internal buffers. There are no indications of malicious code, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation. The code appears to be designed for testing network interactions without performing any real network or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign mocking utility for network testing. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and intended for testing environments only.",
