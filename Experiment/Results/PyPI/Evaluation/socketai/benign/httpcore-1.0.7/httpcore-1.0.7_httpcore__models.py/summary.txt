  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured HTTP utility library with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It employs standard practices for URL handling, header validation, stream management, and proxy configuration. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero. The slight risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects typical operational risks associated with handling untrusted input, but these are mitigated by strict validation."
