{
  "purpose": "Checks if a socket is ready for reading without blocking, using select.select() or select.poll() depending on platform.",
  "sources": "The socket object passed to is_socket_readable(), specifically sock.fileno()",
  "sinks": "None; the function only checks socket status without data transmission or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input socket -> platform-specific select/poll check -> boolean indicating readability",
  "anomalies": "Returning True for None or invalid socket descriptors may be counterintuitive but is documented as a design choice for non-blocking checks.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements a non-blocking socket readability check, handling platform differences and edge cases. It uses standard Python libraries and patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The function's logic is straightforward, and the comments clarify its intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign and utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard socket readiness utility with no malicious intent or security issues. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
