{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to check whether a given socket is readable without blocking, using different mechanisms depending on the platform.",
  "sources": "Reads the socket object to obtain its file descriptor via sock.fileno()",
  "sinks": "Uses select.select() and select.poll() to check socket readability, which can be considered sensitive operations but are standard for non-blocking socket checks",
  "flows": "Source: socket.fileno() -> Sink: select.select()/select.poll()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no external data exfiltration or malicious network activity observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to check socket readability, handling edge cases such as None sockets or invalid file descriptors. It uses platform-specific methods: select.select() on Windows or when select.poll() is unavailable, and select.poll() otherwise. The comments clarify the intention and source of implementation. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with standard non-blocking socket checks. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility function for socket readiness checking with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is a benign implementation used for I/O multiplexing.",
