{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility function to check if a socket is readable without blocking, primarily for network I/O readiness checks.",
  "sources": "The function reads the socket object to obtain its file descriptor (sock.fileno()).",
  "sinks": "The function uses select.select() and select.poll() to determine socket readability, which are untrusted system calls that could potentially be manipulated in a malicious environment, but are standard for I/O readiness checks.",
  "flows": "Source: sock.fileno() -> Sink: select.select() / select.poll() -> Outcome: boolean indicating readability.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior. Uses standard socket readiness check patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard check for socket readability using system calls. It includes appropriate handling for None or invalid socket descriptors, and the logic adapts to platform differences. No data is sent or received, and no external or network communications are initiated. The code relies on standard Python libraries and typical patterns for socket readiness detection. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The only potential concern is the handling of None or invalid sockets, which is handled gracefully and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function to check socket readability, using standard system calls without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It appears safe and straightforward.",
