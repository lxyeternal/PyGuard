  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core function: checking socket readability using select/select.poll.\n- No report indicates any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic.\n- The code is a standard utility for non-blocking socket checks.\n- The code handles edge cases (None socket, invalid file descriptor) gracefully.\n- The use of select and poll is appropriate and common in network programming.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious data exfiltration, or code injection.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's presence and behavior:\n- The code matches the description: it checks socket readability via `select.select()` or `select.poll()`.\n- It correctly handles platform differences.\n- It treats invalid or None sockets as readable, which is standard for such utilities.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The code appears correct and well-structured.\n- The only minor note is that returning `True` for invalid or None sockets might be counterintuitive in some contexts but is acceptable here as a design choice.\n- No security flaws or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0. The code is benign.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0.1, which seems reasonable given the function's nature. It’s a utility function, not inherently risky but involves system calls that could be misused if misapplied. Still, the risk is minimal.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- No report suggests any malicious intent or code.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (acceptable, given it involves system calls, but no actual risk in the code itself)\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign socket readiness utility. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No suspicious activity or malicious intent is detected. The only potential concern is the handling of invalid sockets, but that is a design choice rather than a flaw.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Risk score: **0.1**  \n\nThe code and reports are aligned, and I see no reason to adjust the scores or raise concerns.",
