{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to check if a socket is ready for reading without blocking.",
  "sources": "Reads the socket object and its file descriptor, as well as system platform and select module attributes.",
  "sinks": "Uses select.select and select.poll to determine socket readability, which could potentially be exploited if manipulated with untrusted socket objects.",
  "flows": "Socket object (or None) -> socket.fileno() -> select/select.poll -> return readability status.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code comments indicate awareness of platform differences but do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to check socket readability using select and poll mechanisms, with handling for different platforms. It correctly avoids blocking reads and treats invalid sockets as readable, which is standard. No untrusted data input or malicious operations are present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility with no signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard socket readability check utility. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indicators. The logic is clear, and no suspicious or malicious code is evident.",
