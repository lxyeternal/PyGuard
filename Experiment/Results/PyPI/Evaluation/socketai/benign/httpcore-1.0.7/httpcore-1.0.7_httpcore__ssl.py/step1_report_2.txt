  "purpose": "Creates and returns a default SSL context with certificate verification using certifi's trusted CA bundle.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi library via certifi.where() to load CA certificates.",
  "sinks": "The SSL context is used for secure network connections; no direct sink of untrusted data in the code itself.",
  "flows": "The function creates an SSL context, loads trusted CA certificates, and returns it for use in network connections.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present. The code is standard SSL setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard SSL and certifi libraries, defines a function to create a default SSL context, loads CA certificates from certifi, and returns the context. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and aligns with common practices for secure SSL setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a normal, secure setup of an SSL context for TLS connections using trusted CAs from certifi. No malicious or suspicious activity is present.",
