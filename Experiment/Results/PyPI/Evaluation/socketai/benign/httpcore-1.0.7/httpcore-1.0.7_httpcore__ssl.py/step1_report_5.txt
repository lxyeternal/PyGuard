  "purpose": "Create a default SSL context with verified certificates for secure network communication.",
  "sources": "Calls to ssl.create_default_context() and certifi.where() for obtaining SSL context and CA bundle location.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code sets up SSL verification but does not send or receive data.",
  "flows": "The SSL context is configured with trusted certificates, used for secure connections, but no data flow is present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; standard SSL setup using well-known libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the ssl and certifi libraries to establish a default SSL context. It creates the context via ssl.create_default_context() and loads the trusted CA certificates with certifi.where(). The function is straightforward and implements standard best practices for SSL verification. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code is clear, simple, and standard for establishing secure connections.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a standard SSL setup for secure network communication, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly uses trusted libraries to verify certificates, and there are no anomalies or suspicious activities.",
