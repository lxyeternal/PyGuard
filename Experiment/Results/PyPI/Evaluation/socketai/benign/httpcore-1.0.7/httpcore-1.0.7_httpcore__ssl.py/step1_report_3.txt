  "purpose": "Create and return a default SSL context with certificate verification loaded from certifi's CA bundle.",
  "sources": "ssl.create_default_context() and certifi.where()",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or untrusted data effects are present.",
  "flows": "SSL context created from system defaults, then verify locations loaded from certifi CA bundle.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard ssl and certifi libraries to create a secure SSL context. It initializes a default SSL context and explicitly loads verification certificates from the certifi CA bundle, ensuring proper SSL verification. No untrusted input, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious functions or data flows are observed. The code serves a clear, legitimate purpose of setting up secure connections.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation for setting up SSL context with proper certificate verification. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
