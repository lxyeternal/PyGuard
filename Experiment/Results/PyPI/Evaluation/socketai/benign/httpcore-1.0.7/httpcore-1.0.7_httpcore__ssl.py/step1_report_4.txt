  "purpose": "Create a default SSL context with verified certificate authorities using certifi.",
  "sources": "ssl.create_default_context(), certifi.where()",
  "sinks": "None; the code only sets up an SSL context for secure connections",
  "flows": "Creating SSL context -> Loading verify locations from certifi",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for SSL setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports ssl and certifi modules, defines a function to create a default SSL context, and loads verification locations from certifi. The implementation is standard practice for establishing SSL contexts with trusted CAs. No suspicious or malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for setting up SSL verification with certifi and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security issues.",
