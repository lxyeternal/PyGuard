  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe provided code:\n```python\nimport ssl\nimport certifi\n\ndef default_ssl_context() -> ssl.SSLContext:\n    context = ssl.create_default_context()\n    context.load_verify_locations(certifi.where())\n    return context\n```\nThis code creates an SSL context with proper CA verification, loading the CA bundle from certifi. It is a standard, well-understood pattern for establishing secure SSL/TLS connections.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Create SSL context with certifi CA bundle.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly describes the code; no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0, Obfuscated 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; the code loads CA certificates from certifi and creates an SSL context.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0.1, Obfuscated 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly elevated security risk score (0.1), but the reasoning is that it’s a standard SSL setup. This is acceptable; the code itself isn't risky but could be misused in a malicious context. The score seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Similar SSL context creation.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; no suspicious patterns or anomalies.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0.1, Obfuscated 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Standard SSL setup.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; standard practice, no malicious activity.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0, Obfuscated 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** SSL context creation.\n- **Analysis:** Again, a straightforward, standard implementation.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0, Obfuscated 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly interpret the code.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign malware score 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated in some reports (0.1), justified by the fact that while the code is benign, SSL setup can be misused if embedded in malicious software, but the code itself is safe.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code and logical analysis.\n- The malware score should remain 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscation score is correctly 0.\n- The security risk score can stay at 0 or 0.1; given the code's benign nature, 0 is reasonable, but a small risk score (0.1) can be justified for potential misuse in malicious contexts.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (standard SSL setup, slight potential for misuse but no actual risk in the code)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The scores are reasonable, and there are no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The code is a typical, secure SSL context setup with no issues.",
