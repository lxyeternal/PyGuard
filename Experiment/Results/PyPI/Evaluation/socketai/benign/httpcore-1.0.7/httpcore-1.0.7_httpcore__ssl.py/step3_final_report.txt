{
  "purpose": "Create an SSL context with default settings and load CA certificates from certifi's bundle to ensure trusted SSL/TLS connections.",
  "sources": "The code reads CA certificates from certifi.where() to verify server certificates during SSL handshake.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or data sinks; the code does not process external inputs or send data externally.",
  "flows": "The code creates an SSL context and loads CA certificates; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a secure SSL context using Python's ssl module and certifi's CA bundle, following best practices. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations beyond setting up SSL, or contain obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is negligible. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure SSL context setup with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The current scores are justified; no modifications are necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
