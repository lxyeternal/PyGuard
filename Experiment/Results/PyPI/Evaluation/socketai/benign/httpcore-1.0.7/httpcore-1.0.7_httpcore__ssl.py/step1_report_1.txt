  "purpose": "Create a default SSL context with certificate verification using certifi's CA bundle",
  "sources": "Calls to ssl.create_default_context() and certifi.where() for loading CA certificates",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Initialization of SSL context with CA certificates; no untrusted data flow or external data input involved",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code simply creates an SSL context and loads trusted CA certificates from certifi, a reputable source. It does not process untrusted input, execute any malicious code, or perform network operations beyond setting up SSL verification. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for establishing a secure SSL context with proper CA verification, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
