  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, potential security implications, and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code manages imports and optional dependencies for an HTTP core library.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The handling of optional dependencies via try-except and raising RuntimeError is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears benign and well-structured.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. Overall accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is thorough and accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the module's role in import management and optional dependencies.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior or obfuscation. Standard pattern for optional dependencies.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, correctly describes the module's role.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation. The setting of `__module__` attributes is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the module's role.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) assigned, possibly due to the conditional import pattern and error handling. However, this pattern is common and does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; the risk score might be slightly overstated but is still low.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but acceptable. No significant issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The pattern is typical for optional dependencies.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; thus, malware scores should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores should stay at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 in report 4) is acceptable given the nature of optional dependencies, but overall, the code is very low risk.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.1 (keeping it at 0 for simplicity, as no real risk is present)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured package initializer managing optional dependencies with proper error handling. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, with minor conservatism in the security risk score for report 4. Overall, the code is safe.",
