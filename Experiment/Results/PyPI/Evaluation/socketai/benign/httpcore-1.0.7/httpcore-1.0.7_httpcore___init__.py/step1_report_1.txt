{
  "purpose": "This code defines the public API and imports for an HTTP core library, managing dependencies for different backends and exposing various classes and functions for HTTP request handling.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and handles optional dependencies ('anyio' and 'trio') via try-except blocks.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; the code mainly imports modules and sets __module__ attributes.",
  "flows": "Import statements lead to module initialization; no data flow from sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import classes ('AnyIOBackend', 'TrioBackend') raise RuntimeError if dependencies are missing, which is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages imports and module exports. It conditionally imports optional dependencies with error handling to notify users if dependencies are missing. It sets module attributes for all exported symbols to ensure consistent module attribution. There are no signs of malicious code, code injection, or suspicious behavior. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, designed to re-export symbols and manage optional dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured package initializer without malicious intent. No security risks or malware indicators are present. It effectively manages dependencies and exports modules and classes for the HTTP core library.",
