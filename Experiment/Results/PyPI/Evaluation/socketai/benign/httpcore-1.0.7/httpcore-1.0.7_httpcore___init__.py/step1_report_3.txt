{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports various modules, classes, and functions related to HTTP core functionality, including asynchronous and synchronous network operations, backends, exceptions, and models. It also conditionally imports optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes from internal package files; conditional imports for optional dependencies 'anyio' and 'trio'.",
  "sinks": "Exports all imported classes and functions as module attributes, making them accessible externally; no direct untrusted data handling or external network effects present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code primarily involves static imports and attribute setting without runtime data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import classes for optional dependencies raise RuntimeErrors if dependencies are missing, which is normal behavior. The code does not include dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The last loop sets the __module__ attribute of exported symbols, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly organizes and exposes internal components related to HTTP core functionality, with conditional imports for optional dependencies 'anyio' and 'trio'. These conditional classes simply raise RuntimeErrors if the dependencies are missing, which is a standard pattern for optional dependencies. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present. The code does not process untrusted input or include network communications. The module attributes are set to facilitate module organization but do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization and organization script, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The conditional imports are appropriate for optional dependencies and do not introduce vulnerabilities.",
