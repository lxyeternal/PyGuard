  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes typical package __init__ behavior—importing modules, handling optional dependencies.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard conditional import pattern with exception raising if dependencies missing.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, no malware, no security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. This aligns well with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1, focusing on import management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Standard pattern for optional dependencies; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Organizing exports, conditional optional dependencies.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; standard practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup, package initialization.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), possibly due to the pattern of raising RuntimeError for missing dependencies—though this is common.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. The risk score might be slightly overestimated, but it's not unreasonable given the pattern.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others—package setup.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; standard conditional imports.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code. The code is purely for import management and optional dependency handling.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—package initialization, optional dependencies, exception raising—it's standard practice. The only slight concern is the pattern of raising RuntimeError if dependencies are missing, which could be viewed as a minor security consideration, but it's typical and not malicious.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a very low, acceptable risk for dependency management code)\n\n**Justification:** The code is standard, well-structured, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The minor risk score accounts for the dependency exception pattern but does not indicate any security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, with negligible security risk. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscated scores at zero, and a very low risk score (around 0.1) to acknowledge the dependency handling pattern.",
