{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper methods for Bézier curve operations, with optional Cython/Fortran speedups.",
  "sources": "Import statements for bezier.hazmat.curve_helpers and optional _speedup module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code assigns functions from either curve_helpers or _speedup based on availability, but does not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a conditional wrapper that assigns function references based on the presence of a compiled extension. It imports from a well-defined package, with fallback mechanisms that do not execute any untrusted or malicious code. There are no user inputs, data flows, or operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The code is standard for performance optimization, involving no suspicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign helper module intended to optimize Bézier curve computations. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
