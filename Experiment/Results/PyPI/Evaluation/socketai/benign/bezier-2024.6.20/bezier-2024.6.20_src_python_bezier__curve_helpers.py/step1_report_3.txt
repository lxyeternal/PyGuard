{
  "purpose": "Provides helper methods for Bezier curve computations with optional Cython speedup, calling external Fortran implementation if available.",
  "sources": "Imports bezier.hazmat.curve_helpers; attempts to import _speedup from bezier",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or output manipulation observed",
  "flows": "Imports external modules, conditionally assigns function references based on availability of _speedup",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns observed. The code dynamically assigns functions based on optional Cython speedup, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages function assignment for Bezier curve computations, checking for the presence of a compiled speedup module and assigning function references accordingly. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data processing, or network activity. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The structure is standard for optional acceleration of Python code using Cython or similar tools.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign helper module for mathematical computations related to Bezier curves, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It dynamically assigns functions based on available modules, which is normal for performance optimization.",
