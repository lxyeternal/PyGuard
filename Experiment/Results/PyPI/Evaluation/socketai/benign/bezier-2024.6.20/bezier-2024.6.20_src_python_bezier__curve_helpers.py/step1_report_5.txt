{
  "purpose": "This module provides helper functions for Bézier curve computations, with optional Cython speedup via a Fortran implementation.",
  "sources": "Imports bezier.hazmat.curve_helpers and attempts to import _speedup from bezier.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present; the code primarily defines function aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code assigns functions based on the availability of _speedup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a speedup module and, if unavailable, falls back to standard Python implementations from bezier.hazmat. It conditionally assigns function variables for performance optimization. No user input, network communication, or data manipulation with untrusted sources is present. The structure is standard for optional Cython or Fortran acceleration, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical performance optimization wrapper around bezier curve helper functions. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
