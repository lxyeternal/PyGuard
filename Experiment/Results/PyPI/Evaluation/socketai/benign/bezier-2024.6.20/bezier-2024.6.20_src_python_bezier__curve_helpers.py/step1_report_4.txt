{
  "purpose": "Provides helper methods for Bézier curves, with optional Cython/Fortran speedups.",
  "sources": "Imports bezier.hazmat.curve_helpers, attempts to import bezier._speedup",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data is being output or transferred externally",
  "flows": "Uses _speedup if available to override functions from curve_helpers, otherwise defaults to curve_helpers",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import logic and function assignments based on availability of _speedup",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a module '_speedup' for performance improvements. If unavailable, it assigns functions from 'curve_helpers'. This pattern is common in Python to enable optional Cython or C extensions. No user input, external data, or network communication occurs. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation are present. The code structure and logic are standard and do not suggest malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of optional speedup modules with no malicious behavior detected. It serves as a performance-enhancing wrapper around core Bézier curve functions. No security risks or malware signals are identified.",
