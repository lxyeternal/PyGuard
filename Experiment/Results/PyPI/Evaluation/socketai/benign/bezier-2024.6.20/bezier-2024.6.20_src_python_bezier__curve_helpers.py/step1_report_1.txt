{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for Bezier curve computations, including fallback to Cython speedups with a Fortran backend if available.",
  "sources": "Imports bezier.hazmat.curve_helpers, and attempts to import a speedup module (_speedup) which provides optimized functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only defines function aliases and imports modules.",
  "flows": "Input data would flow through the functions imported from curve_helpers or _speedup, but no specific source-to-sink flow is evident since no data processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code structure is straightforward, conditionally assigning function aliases based on availability of _speedup.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally assigns function references based on the success of importing a speedup module, which is a typical pattern for optimizing performance. No external input handling, data processing, or potentially malicious behavior is present. It does not include any external data sources or sinks, nor does it execute any untrusted code or perform system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard helper utility for mathematical computations related to Bezier curves, utilizing optional Cython/Fortran acceleration. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
