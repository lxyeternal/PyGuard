  "purpose": "Define common features and utilities for representing and manipulating geometric shapes (Bezier shapes), including node management and conversions.",
  "sources": "Input data for shape control points (`nodes` parameter in constructors and functions).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used in a manner that leads to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input nodes -> conversion functions -> shape object initialization; no untrusted data flows into sensitive system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets observed. The functions perform straightforward data validation and type conversions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a class for representing shapes with control points, including data validation and type safety via NumPy conversions. The utility functions ensure data integrity by enforcing 2D array structure and type consistency. There are no network operations, file I/O, or dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted inputs in a way that could lead to exploitation. The code appears standard for geometric shape management, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for shape data management and conversion, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs input validation and data conversions safely. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code appears trustworthy.",
