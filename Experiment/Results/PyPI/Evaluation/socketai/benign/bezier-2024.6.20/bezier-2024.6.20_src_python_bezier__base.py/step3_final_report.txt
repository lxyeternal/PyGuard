{
  "purpose": "This code provides a base class for shape objects, managing control points and shape attributes with utility functions for data validation and conversion.",
  "sources": "The 'nodes' parameter passed to the constructor, and internal functions like sequence_to_array and _lossless_to_float.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data outputs; data validation functions raise exceptions on invalid input but do not leak data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "Input 'nodes' flow into sequence_to_array, which converts to a NumPy array, then into the class instance; no external data flow or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a shape class with control points, enforcing data shape and type integrity through validation functions. It does not perform any network, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The functions handle data conversion and validation safely, with proper error handling. The overall structure and content are benign, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing shape data, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1—are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
