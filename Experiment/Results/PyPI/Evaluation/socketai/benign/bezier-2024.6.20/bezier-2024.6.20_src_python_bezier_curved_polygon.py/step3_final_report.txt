  "purpose": "Defines a geometric class for curved polygons composed of Bezier curves, including verification of shared endpoints, area calculation via Green's theorem, and plotting functionalities.",
  "sources": "Internal attributes such as _edges, _nodes within each Curve object, and helper modules for computations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data inputs; primarily computational and visualization routines.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal edge definitions through verification, area computation, and plotting functions; no external untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected; verification limited to endpoint matching without self-intersection checks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured geometric utility class for modeling curved polygons with Bezier curves. It performs endpoint verification, area calculation, and visualization using external helper modules. No external data inputs or network activity are involved. The verification process only checks for shared endpoints, which is a geometric constraint, not a security vulnerability. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious geometric utility class with no security risks or obfuscation. It performs standard operations and verification for curved polygons without external data dependencies or malicious behaviors. The supply chain security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores should be set to 0. The overall security assessment confirms the code is safe and suitable for use.",
