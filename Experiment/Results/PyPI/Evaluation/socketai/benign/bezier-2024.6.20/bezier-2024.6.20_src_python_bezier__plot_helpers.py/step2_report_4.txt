  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of plotting utilities using matplotlib and numpy, with no external input handling, network operations, or data processing involving untrusted sources.\n- The code dynamically imports matplotlib within functions, which is a common pattern to reduce overhead.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The functions operate on in-memory data, primarily for visualization purposes.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & sources:** Standard plotting functions, reading data from axes and bezier edges.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No external data leaks or untrusted input processing.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Benign, well-structured plotting utility.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `confidence=1`.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & sources:** Similar to above, with standard data sources.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No external data or untrusted input.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Safe visualization code.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0.2`, `confidence=0.9`.\n\n**Note:** The `securityRisk=0.2` seems slightly high for benign plotting code, but since it’s consistent with the report's reasoning, it can stay. No need to increase the malware score.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & sources:** Same pattern, standard plotting.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No external untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `confidence=0.9`.\n\nConsistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & sources:** Similar, with standard libraries.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No external untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Safe visualization utility.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `confidence=0.9`.\n\nNo issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & sources:** Same as others.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `confidence=1`.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`, which is correct. The code is standard plotting code with no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All `0`, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (`0.2`), justified by the fact that the code dynamically imports libraries, which could be misused in different contexts. However, in this context, it is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malware present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — the code is purely for visualization, with no external data handling or security implications.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a benign, well-structured plotting utility module. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, but I would set the overall risk score to **0** for clarity, given the benign nature.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always consider context; if this code were part of a larger system handling untrusted data or involved in network operations, the risk assessment might differ. But based solely on this snippet, it is safe.",
