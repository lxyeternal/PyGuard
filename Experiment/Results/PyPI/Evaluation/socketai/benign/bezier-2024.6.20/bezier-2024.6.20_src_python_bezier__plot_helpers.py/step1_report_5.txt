{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for plotting with matplotlib, including creating axes, adding plot boundaries, and adding polygon patches.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from matplotlib's axis and line objects, and from bezier curve objects for plotting.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or system commands are executed.",
  "flows": "Input data from matplotlib axis lines or bezier curve evaluations flows into plotting functions and visualization elements; no external untrusted data flows into system or network.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors. Runtime import of matplotlib is noted but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions for plotting with matplotlib, including creating axes, adjusting plot boundaries, and adding polygon patches based on bezier curve evaluations. It uses runtime imports to optimize performance but does not handle untrusted data or execute external commands. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. No hardcoded credentials, network access, or system modifications are present. The code appears to be standard plotting utility code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign plotting utility module with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It simply provides visualization functions and does not interact with external systems or untrusted inputs.",
