  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured plotting utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (0 or 0.2) reflecting minimal concern due to dynamic imports but no actual vulnerabilities."
