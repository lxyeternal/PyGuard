{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for plotting with matplotlib, including creating axes, adding plot boundaries, and adding polygon patches, primarily for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as plot line data (ax.lines), evaluation points on Bezier curve edges, and matplotlib configuration data. It does not read untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with matplotlib's plotting functions, which render visual output. There are no sinks that send data over network, write files, or perform system modifications.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the matplotlib axis object to various plotting functions, such as extracting line data, evaluating curve points, and rendering patches, all within controlled visualization routines.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard plotting library calls, evaluates curves with a fixed parameter array, and does not include any suspicious dynamic code execution or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a visualization utility that dynamically creates matplotlib axes, adds plot boundaries with padding based on existing line data, and adds polygon patches approximated from Bezier curve edges. All functions rely on standard library calls and in-memory data. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious code patterns are present. The imports are controlled and limited to visualization libraries, and there are no external data reads, external command executions, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign plotting utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates entirely within the scope of visualization and does not interact with external systems in a suspicious manner.",
