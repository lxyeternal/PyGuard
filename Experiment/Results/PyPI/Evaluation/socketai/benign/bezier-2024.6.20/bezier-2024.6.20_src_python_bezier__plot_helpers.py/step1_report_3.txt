{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for plotting using matplotlib, including creating axes, adding plot boundaries, and patches for visualizations.",
  "sources": "Imports of numpy, bezier._helpers, and matplotlib libraries; usage of data from matplotlib objects like ax.lines and edge evaluations.",
  "sinks": "Data extraction from matplotlib objects; no sinks that process untrusted external data or user input are present.",
  "flows": "No external untrusted data sources are processed; data flows are limited to plotting data within the script.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code employs runtime imports, which is common in optional dependency handling.",
  "analysis": "The script provides plotting utilities with functions to create axes, set plot boundaries, and add polygon patches. It dynamically imports matplotlib inside functions to avoid unnecessary overhead. No data from external sources or user input is processed, and no network or file operations are performed. The code appears standard for visualization purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate plotting utility code with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It only manipulates plotting data internally and does not handle untrusted inputs or perform network/file operations.",
