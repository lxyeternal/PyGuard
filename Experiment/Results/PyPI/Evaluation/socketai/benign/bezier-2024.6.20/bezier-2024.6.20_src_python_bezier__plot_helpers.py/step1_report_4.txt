{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for plotting using matplotlib, including creating axes, adding plot boundaries, and adding polygon patches to plots.",
  "sources": "Imports data from external libraries: numpy, bezier._helpers, matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib.patches, matplotlib.path",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies matplotlib axis properties, plotting data, or adding patches based on evaluated bezier curves; no direct sink for untrusted data that leads to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input data from numpy arrays and bezier curve evaluations flow into plotting functions and axis modifications; no untrusted external input is processed or forwarded.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior. Dynamic imports are used for performance reasons, which is common in plotting utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions for plotting with matplotlib, dynamically importing modules to optimize performance. It processes input data for plotting boundaries and patches derived from bezier curves. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. The code strictly handles plotting logic and mathematical evaluation for visualizations. No external inputs are processed that could lead to security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign plotting utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It is well-structured for its purpose, with no suspicious patterns or potential for harm.",
