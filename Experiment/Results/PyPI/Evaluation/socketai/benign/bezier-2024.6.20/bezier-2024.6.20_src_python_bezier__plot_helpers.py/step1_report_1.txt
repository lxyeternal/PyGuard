{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for plotting with matplotlib, specifically creating axes, adding plot boundaries, and adding polygonal patches.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from matplotlib axes and line objects, as well as edge objects with evaluate_multi methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that handle untrusted data in a way that could lead to data leaks or security effects. It creates visual plot components but does not involve untrusted input handling or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from axes and lines into boundary calculations and polygon generation; no untrusted input is processed or propagated to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are observed. All imported modules are standard or legitimate (numpy, matplotlib, bezier helpers).",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of plotting utility functions that dynamically import matplotlib for efficiency, manipulate axis limits based on data, and add polygon patches based on bezier curve evaluations. No external input handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing is present. The code appears to be well-structured, with proper use of libraries, and there are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign plotting utility module with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily manipulates matplotlib objects to assist in plotting geometric data. There is no evidence of malware, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities.",
