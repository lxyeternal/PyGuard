  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for bezier.triangle with optional Cython/Fortran speedups, falling back to pure Python implementations if the speedup module is unavailable.",
  "sources": "Import statement attempting to load '_speedup' module; fallback to 'triangle_helpers' functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external data, or network activity; purely local function assignments.",
  "flows": "Conditional import of '_speedup' influences assignment of helper functions; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; standard import fallback pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import an optional '_speedup' module for performance improvements. If unavailable, it assigns functions from 'triangle_helpers'. There are no inputs, outputs, or external communications. The pattern is common in scientific Python packages. No malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code is straightforward, with clear fallback logic, and no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The import fallback pattern is typical and does not introduce vulnerabilities. All evidence indicates the code is secure and trustworthy.",
