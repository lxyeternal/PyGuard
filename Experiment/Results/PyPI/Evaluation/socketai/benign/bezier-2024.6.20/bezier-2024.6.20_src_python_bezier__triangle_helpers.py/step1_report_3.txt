{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to provide helper functions for bezier.triangle, with optional speedups using Cython or Fortran implementations.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the bezier.hazmat.triangle_helpers module and attempts to import _speedup from bezier, falling back to local helpers if not available.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks; no untrusted data input, network communication, or sensitive data handling is present.",
  "flows": "The code sets function references based on the availability of the _speedup module, choosing between pure Python helpers and optimized speedups.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. The import fallbacks are standard practice for optional optimization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports helper functions for bezier.triangle operations, with an attempt to load an optional _speedup module for performance. If _speedup is unavailable, it defaults to pure Python implementations. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The only decision points involve conditional imports and function assignments, which are typical for performance optimization in scientific computing libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard implementation for optional performance enhancement in a scientific Python package. No malicious behavior, no security risks, and no anomalies are identified.",
