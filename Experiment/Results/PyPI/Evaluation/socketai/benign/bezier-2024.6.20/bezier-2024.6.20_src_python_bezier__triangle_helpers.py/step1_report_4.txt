{
  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for Bezier triangle computations, with optional Cython/Fortran speedups.",
  "sources": "Imports modules 'bezier.hazmat' and 'bezier', attempts to import '_speedup'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Uses '_speedup' if available, otherwise falls back to 'triangle_helpers' functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard import and fallback pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally assigns functions based on the availability of a speedup module, which is typical for performance optimization. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscated code are present. The use of try-except is normal for optional dependencies. The code’s structure suggests typical library helper functions for computational geometry with optional performance enhancements. No data is read from external sources or transmitted over network connections. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard helper module with optional performance enhancements and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
