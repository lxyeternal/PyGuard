{
  "purpose": "This module provides helper functions for bezier.triangle, with optional Cython/Fortran speedups.",
  "sources": "Imports from bezier.hazmat and bezier modules, and the try-except block that loads _speedup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or output in this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code defines functions and conditional assignments without data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed. The try-except handling of optional speedup module is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports helper functions for bezier triangle operations, with a fallback mechanism if a speedup module is unavailable. It does not process external data, handle user input, or perform network operations. The conditional loading and assignment are typical for performance optimization, and no obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard helper module with optional speedup implementations. It shows no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
