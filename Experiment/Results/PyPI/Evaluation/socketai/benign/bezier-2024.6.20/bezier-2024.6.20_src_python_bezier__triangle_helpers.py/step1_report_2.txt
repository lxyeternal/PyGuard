{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for the bezier.triangle module, with optional Cython speedups or fallback to pure Python implementations.",
  "sources": "Imports 'bezier.hazmat.triangle_helpers' and attempts to import '_speedup' from 'bezier'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input are present; the code primarily sets up function references.",
  "flows": "Imports source -> conditional assignment based on '_speedup' availability -> assignment of functions from either 'triangle_helpers' or '_speedup'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or obfuscated constructs. The code properly handles ImportError and assigns functions accordingly.",
  "analysis": "The code imports helper modules and conditionally assigns functions depending on the presence of an optional '_speedup' module. This is a common pattern for optional performance enhancements. No untrusted input handling, no data leaks, or malicious patterns are evident. The code does not perform any network operations, file access, or credential handling. It strictly manages function references based on available modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup for performance optimization with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
