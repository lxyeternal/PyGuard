  "purpose": "Helper module for bezier.triangle providing functions with optional Cython or Fortran speedup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from bezier.hazmat and bezier modules, specifically trying to import _speedup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident; no untrusted data handling or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly assigns functions based on import success.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import pattern for optional speedup modules; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a Cython-accelerated module '_speedup' for performance enhancement. If the import fails, it falls back to functions from bezier.hazmat.triangle_helpers. This is a standard pattern for optional speedup modules. There are no user inputs, network operations, or data leaks. The code does not execute external commands or handle untrusted data. It primarily sets function references based on availability, which is typical for performance optimization. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The code appears clean, structured, and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign helper module with conditional imports for performance optimization. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
