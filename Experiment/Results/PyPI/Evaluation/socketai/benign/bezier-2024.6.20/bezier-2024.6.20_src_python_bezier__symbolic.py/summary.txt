  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign symbolic algebra utility for geometric computations. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are present. The only potential risk is resource exhaustion via symbolic resultants if misused, which is a known limitation of symbolic libraries, not an attack. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the computational expense concern."
