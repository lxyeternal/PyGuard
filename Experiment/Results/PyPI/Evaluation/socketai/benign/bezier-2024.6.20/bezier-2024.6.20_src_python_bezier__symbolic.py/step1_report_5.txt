{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for converting 2D/3D nodes into symbolic polynomial representations, implicitizing parametric curves and surfaces, and computing de Casteljau weights for Bezier curves and triangles.",
  "sources": "Inputs include numpy.ndarray nodes for curves and surfaces, and symbolic expressions/functions for implicitization.",
  "sinks": "The main potential sink is the use of sympy.resultant for implicitization, which involves symbolic algebra that could potentially be misused if input expressions are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from numpy arrays (nodes) through symbolic conversions to polynomial expressions, then to symbolic resultants for implicitization, with weights and polynomial calculations in between.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports sympy within functions, which is standard for avoiding import overhead but could be exploited if malicious input is provided to the functions expecting symbolic expressions. No hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors are present. No obfuscated code features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a mathematical utility library for symbolic algebra involving Bezier curves, triangles, and implicitization. It performs symbolic conversions, weight calculations, and resultants, all through sympy. There are no signs of malicious payloads such as network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration. The dynamic import of sympy is a standard practice. The functions rely on legitimate symbolic mathematics procedures. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a mathematical helper for symbolic algebra with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It uses dynamic imports to optimize performance and provides mathematical transformations. No security risks or malicious behaviors are detected.",
