  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for symbolic algebra involving Bézier curves and triangles.\n- Findings: No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses runtime import of 'sympy' as a benign performance optimization.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis report correctly identifies the code as a benign mathematical library. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Similar symbolic algebra functions, with emphasis on potential risks.\n- Findings: The use of 'sympy.resultant' could be exploited with malicious expressions, leading to resource exhaustion or complex symbolic computations, but this is inherent to symbolic libraries and not malicious.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2 (due to potential computational expense)\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report appropriately notes that 'sympy.resultant' can be computationally expensive if misused, but this is a known aspect of symbolic computation, not malicious. No malicious intent or backdoors are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Similar symbolic algebra functions.\n- Findings: No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. Uses dynamic import of 'sympy' for performance.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis aligns with the code. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Findings: No malicious behavior, just mathematical symbolic computations. Uses runtime import.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrectly identified as benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Similar functions.\n- Findings: The only potential concern is the use of 'sympy.resultant', which could be computationally expensive or exploited if provided with malicious symbolic expressions. No network or system modifications observed.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2 (again, related to symbolic computation expense)\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is a fair point; 'sympy.resultant' can be expensive or exploited in theory, but it is a standard symbolic operation. No malicious intent or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of malware:** No. All reports agree that the code performs legitimate symbolic algebra functions.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None. The code is a mathematical utility library, with no network, file, or system manipulation.\n- **Potential security concerns:** The only minor concern is the computational expense and potential for resource exhaustion via 'sympy.resultant' if maliciously crafted expressions are used. This is a known risk in symbolic computation but not malicious per se.\n\n### Final Scores and Justification:\n\n| Aspect             | Estimated Score | Justification                                                                                     |\n|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**       | **0**             | No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage.                                            |\n| **Obfuscated**    | **0**             | Code is clear, well-structured, with no obfuscation.                                             |\n| **Risk**          | **0.2**           | Slight risk related to symbolic computation complexity/exploitation, but not malicious.       |\n| **Malware Score** | **0**             | Consistent with the reports and analysis. No malicious activity detected.                     |\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured mathematical utility library for symbolic algebra involving Bézier curves and triangles. It does not contain malware or malicious behaviors. The only caveat is the inherent risk in symbolic computations like 'resultant', which could be exploited to cause resource exhaustion, but this is a known limitation of symbolic libraries, not an attack vector.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nSet malware and obfuscated scores to 0. Keep a small security risk score (~0.2) acknowledging the potential for resource exhaustion if used maliciously, but overall, the code is safe.",
