  "purpose": "Utility functions for symbolic algebra involving Bézier curves and triangles, including conversion to symbolic form, weight computation, polynomial representation, and implicitization.",
  "sources": "Input numpy.ndarray 'nodes', symbolic expressions generated within functions, and parameters like 'degree', 's', 't'.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission; purely mathematical computations with no network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input 'nodes' -> to_symbolic -> symbolic weights and polynomials -> symbolic resultants for implicitization.",
  "anomalies": "Runtime import of 'sympy' within functions for performance; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard symbolic algebra operations using 'sympy' for geometric representations. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The use of 'sympy.resultant' can be computationally expensive and potentially exploited for resource exhaustion if maliciously crafted symbolic expressions are used, but this is a known limitation of symbolic libraries, not malicious intent. The code is well-structured, with clear documentation and no obfuscation. The dynamic import pattern is a performance optimization, not malicious. Overall, the code is benign, with a minor security concern related to symbolic computation complexity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign symbolic algebra utility for geometric computations. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are present. The only potential risk is resource exhaustion via symbolic resultants if misused, which is a known limitation of symbolic libraries, not an attack. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the computational expense concern.",
