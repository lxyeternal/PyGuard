  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a collection of symbolic algebra functions related to Bézier curves and triangles, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly notes that the code performs standard symbolic computations, with runtime imports of 'sympy' as a benign performance optimization.\n- **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Security Risk:** 0, consistent with no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the potential computational expense of 'sympy.resultant' and the possibility of resource exhaustion if inputs are maliciously crafted.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that 'sympy.resultant' can be computationally intensive, but this is a normal feature of symbolic algebra libraries, not malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher at 0.2, due to the potential for resource exhaustion with crafted inputs, but not malicious.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, just a note on potential computational risks.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a benign symbolic algebra utility, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with previous assessments; the use of dynamic imports is a performance choice, not malicious.\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on the benign nature of the symbolic computations.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, no external I/O, no malicious payloads.\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a benign utility library with potential computational costs but no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that the dynamic import is standard and that the use of 'sympy.resultant' could be expensive but not malicious.\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2, due to computational expense with crafted inputs.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and given the code's nature—mathematical symbolic functions with no network or system modifications—this is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** While the 'sympy.resultant' function can be computationally expensive or exploited for denial-of-service if malicious inputs are provided, this is a known characteristic of symbolic algebra libraries, not an indicator of malicious intent. The scores of 0 or 0.2 reflect this understanding.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a legitimate, mathematical utility library for symbolic algebra involving Bézier curves and triangles.\n- There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation.\n- The potential security concern is related to resource exhaustion via symbolic computations with crafted inputs, which is a known and documented risk of such libraries, not malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (a minor, known risk associated with symbolic computation, not malicious)\n\n**Recommendation:** The code appears safe for use, with the caveat that users should validate and limit input complexity to prevent resource exhaustion.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured symbolic algebra utility with no malicious intent. The minor security risk stems from the inherent computational expense of symbolic resultants, not from malicious behavior.",
