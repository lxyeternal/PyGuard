{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for symbolic algebra operations involving Bézier curves and triangles, such as conversion to symbolic form, implicitization, and weight computation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function arguments: 'nodes', 'degree', and functions 'x_fn', 'y_fn', 'z_fn', as well as internally created symbols 's', 't', and 'x', 'y', 'z'.",
  "sinks": "The code performs symbolic calculations and returns symbolic expressions, but does not perform network I/O or write data externally. No external data leaks or network activities are present.",
  "flows": "Input data 'nodes' and 'degree' flow into symbolic conversion and polynomial computation functions; symbolic expressions flow through resultants and simplification functions; no external data transmission or system manipulation observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports 'sympy' within functions to avoid import costs, which is standard for optional symbolic computation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. No obfuscation or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for symbolic geometric computations involving Bézier curves and triangles. It uses runtime imports of 'sympy' for efficiency. All functions seem purposefully designed for mathematical operations without any network or file system interaction. No suspicious data handling, code injection, or malicious intent detected. The absence of I/O or side effects indicates the code's benign nature. No anomalies or malicious indicators found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of mathematical helpers for symbolic algebra and geometric computations, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is well-structured for its purpose, and no malicious signals are identified.",
