{
  "purpose": "Provide helper methods for bezier.triangle with optional Cython or Fortran speedups.",
  "sources": "Import statements, conditional assignment from bezier and bezier.hazmat modules, and the atexit registration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly assigns functions based on availability of speedup modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, handles ImportError for optional speedup modules, and assigns function references accordingly. It registers cleanup functions if speedup modules are available. No user input, data processing, or external communication occurs. The logic is straightforward and standard for performance optimization. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module designed for performance enhancement using optional dependencies. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Overall, the code appears safe.",
