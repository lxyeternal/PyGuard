{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper methods for the bezier.triangle module, with optional Cython/Fortran speedups.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, including bezier.hazmat and bezier._speedup (if available).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Imports bezier modules, conditionally assigns function references based on availability of _speedup, and registers cleanup functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Conditional import and function assignment are standard performance optimization techniques.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports and assigns function references for performance optimization, with fallbacks. It registers cleanup functions if _speedup is available. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors. The code is well-structured, and the only external dependency is the bezier package itself, which is standard. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate helper module for performance optimization in bezier.triangle with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
