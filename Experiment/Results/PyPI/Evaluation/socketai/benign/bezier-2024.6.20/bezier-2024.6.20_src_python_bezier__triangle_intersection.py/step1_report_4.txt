{
  "purpose": "Provide helper methods for bezier.triangle with optional Cython speedup, fallback to pure Python implementations.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially 'from bezier import _speedup' and 'from bezier.hazmat import triangle_intersection'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Code attempts to assign functions from '_speedup' if available, otherwise falls back to 'triangle_intersection'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; the code dynamically selects between optimized Cython code and Python fallback based on import success, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles importing modules, conditional assignment of function references depending on the availability of '_speedup'. It uses 'try-except' for import fallback and registers cleanup functions with 'atexit'. No user input, network activity, or data processing occurs here. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious logic present. The structure is typical for performance optimization and resource management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard helper module with performance optimizations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply manages function references for mathematical operations related to bezier triangles.",
