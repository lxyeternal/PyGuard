{
  "purpose": "Helper module for bezier.triangle, providing functions with optional Cython or Fortran acceleration.",
  "sources": "Imports from bezier.hazmat and bezier modules, as well as the optional _speedup module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Imports and conditional assignment flow from bezier.hazmat, bezier, and _speedup modules to local function names.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages imports and conditional assignment of functions based on the availability of a compiled extension (_speedup). It sets up function references and registers cleanup functions if the extension is present. No input handling, data transmission, or system manipulation code detected. The code appears to be a standard helper module with performance optimizations, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign helper module designed for performance enhancement. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks.",
