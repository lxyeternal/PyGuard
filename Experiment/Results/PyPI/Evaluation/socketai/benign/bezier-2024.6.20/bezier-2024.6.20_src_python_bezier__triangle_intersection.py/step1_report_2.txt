{
  "purpose": "This module provides helper methods for bezier.triangle, offering Cython and Fortran speedups for geometric computations related to triangles.",
  "sources": "Imports from bezier.hazmat and bezier modules, reading _speedup if available.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "The module assigns functions based on the availability of _speedup, affecting how geometric functions are called.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes helper functions for geometric operations, choosing between default and optimized implementations depending on the presence of a Cython extension. It imports necessary modules, handles ImportError gracefully, and registers cleanup functions. The structure and flow are straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious behavior, no external data input, and no data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for performance optimization with optional Cython acceleration. It contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no suspicious anomalies. The implementation appears benign and intended solely for computational efficiency.",
