  "purpose": "Helper methods for bezier.triangle with optional Cython/Fortran speedups, providing performance optimization.",
  "sources": "Import statements, conditional assignment, atexit registration for cleanup.",
  "sinks": "No external data, user input, or network communication; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Conditional import determines which functions are assigned; no data flow beyond function assignment.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with standard dependency handling and cleanup registration.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports an extension module for performance gains, falling back to default implementations if unavailable. It handles ImportError gracefully and registers cleanup functions if the extension is present. No data processing, external communication, or suspicious logic is present. The code is a typical pattern for optional extension support, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for performance optimization, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting its safe and standard nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
