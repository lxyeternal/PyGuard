  "purpose": "Configure environment for Windows DLL search path and handle import errors for the 'bezier' package dependencies.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'BEZIER_EXTRA_DLL', imported modules 'os'.",
  "sinks": "os.add_dll_directory() modifies DLL search path; no direct sink for untrusted data leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'BEZIER_EXTRA_DLL' provides directories; add_dll_directory() adds directories to DLL path if valid; handle_import_error() raises exceptions if unexpected errors occur.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic; straightforward environment setup and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code manages environment variables and DLL search paths specifically on Windows platforms. It only adds directories from a trusted environment variable, with checks for directory existence. Error handling distinguishes between expected import errors and unexpected failures, re-raising anomalies. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are apparent. The logic is clear, and the functions serve typical environment configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment setup script for DLL loading on Windows, with proper checks and error handling. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
