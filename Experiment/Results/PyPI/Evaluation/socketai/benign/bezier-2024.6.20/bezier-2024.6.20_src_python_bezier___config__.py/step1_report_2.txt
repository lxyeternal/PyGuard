  "purpose": "Configure environment for Windows DLL search paths and handle import errors for the 'bezier' package dependencies.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'BEZIER_EXTRA_DLL', os.environ.get(), os.path.isdir(), os.add_dll_directory()",
  "sinks": "os.add_dll_directory() potentially modifies DLL search paths based on environment variable.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'BEZIER_EXTRA_DLL' is split into directories; valid directories are added to DLL search paths via os.add_dll_directory()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. The code is standard environment setup with no obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages DLL directories on Windows by using an environment variable. It includes functions to add directories to DLL search path and handle import errors based on error messages. The code uses standard Python OS and environment functions without executing any untrusted input or network operations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment configuration script for Windows DLL path setup with proper error handling. There are no malicious behaviors or suspicious anomalies. The code appears to be benign and focused solely on environment setup.",
