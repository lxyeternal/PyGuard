  "purpose": "Environment configuration for Windows DLL search path and import error handling in the bezier package.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (EXTRA_DLL_ENV), OS environment, and import statements.",
  "sinks": "os.add_dll_directory() function, which modifies DLL search path.",
  "flows": "Environment variable BEZIER_EXTRA_DLL influences DLL search path when on Windows; import error handling distinguishes expected from unexpected errors.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or malicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations present.",
  "analysis": "The code manages DLL search paths on Windows by adding directories specified via an environment variable. It also handles import errors to differentiate between missing modules due to optional build features and actual errors. All operations are related to environment setup and error handling, with no data leaks, network activity, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard environment setup and error handling module for the bezier package. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. It functions as intended for configuration purposes.",
