  "purpose": "Configure Windows DLL search paths for the bezier package and handle import errors to distinguish expected missing modules from genuine errors.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'BEZIER_EXTRA_DLL', os.environ, os.path.isdir, os.add_dll_directory, import error exception args",
  "sinks": "os.add_dll_directory (modifies DLL search path), exception raising in handle_import_error",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'BEZIER_EXTRA_DLL' -> directory validation -> os.add_dll_directory -> import error handling",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; standard environment setup and error handling logic",
  "analysis": "The code manages DLL directories on Windows based on an environment variable, adding directories if they exist, and handles import errors by matching exception messages to expected patterns. It avoids executing untrusted code, leaks, or malicious payloads. The logic is straightforward, with proper validation and error handling. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The reliance on environment variables is typical for configuration scripts and does not constitute a security risk in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment configuration utility for Windows DLL loading, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the risk score should be 0 or very close to it. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
