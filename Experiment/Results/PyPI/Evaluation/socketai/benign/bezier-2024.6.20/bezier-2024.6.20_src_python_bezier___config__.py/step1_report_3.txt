  "purpose": "Environment configuration for Windows DLL search path setup and import error handling for the 'bezier' package.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'BEZIER_EXTRA_DLL' and import attempts for modules like 'bezier._curve_speedup'.",
  "sinks": "os.add_dll_directory() modifies DLL search paths; no direct data sinks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'BEZIER_EXTRA_DLL' influences DLL directory addition; import error handling distinguishes expected missing modules from unexpected errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code relies on standard environment variable handling and system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code manages DLL search paths on Windows via environment variables and Python's os.add_dll_directory(). It also handles import errors by comparing exception messages to expected templates, re-raising unexpected errors. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The functions are well-documented, and no obfuscation or malware-like patterns are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate configuration and error-handling utility for the 'bezier' package, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
