  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** The report concludes that the script is a standard setup script with no malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It notes that the code reads environment variables for configuration, manages dependencies, and builds extensions if enabled. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n- **Code review:** The code is a typical setup.py with environment-based configuration, dependency checks, and extension module setup. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The logic is straightforward and standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.5 (not explicitly stated but implied as low risk).\n\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; the code is benign. The score for malware is correctly zero. The overall security risk is minimal, given the absence of malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it states that the script is a typical setup configuration, managing dependencies and environment variables, with no suspicious code or malicious activity.\n\n- **Code review:** The code reads environment variables, manages dependencies, and conditionally builds extensions. No network activity or malicious code detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (very low).\n\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is consistent. The low risk score is appropriate; no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** Again, the script is identified as a benign setup script with standard practices, no malicious code, and no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Code review:** Same as above; environment variables control build options, no malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n- **Justification:** The assessment is justified; the code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** The script is a typical setup configuration, with environment variables influencing build options, no suspicious or malicious code, and no obfuscation.\n\n- **Code review:** No signs of malicious activity; standard setup procedures.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n- **Justification:** The reasoning aligns with the code; it is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** The report states that the script manages dependencies, build options, and configuration without signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. It notes that environment variables are used to control build steps, which is normal.\n\n- **Code review:** No network activity, no code injection, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is consistent; the code is a standard setup script.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis**\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected in any report. The code is a typical setup.py script for a Python package.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk scores:** All reports assign very low or zero risk, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimations**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — the code is a typical setup script with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No changes needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The package setup code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
