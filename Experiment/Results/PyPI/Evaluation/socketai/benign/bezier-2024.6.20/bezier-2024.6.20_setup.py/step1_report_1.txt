{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'bezier' Python package, responsible for configuring build, dependencies, and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., BEZIER_NO_EXTENSION, BEZIER_INSTALL_PREFIX, BEZIER_IGNORE_VERSION_CHECK), reads README.rst file for long description, inspects system info (platform, Python version), and imports modules such as os, sys, numpy, setuptools.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data outputs, network activity, or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence configuration flow (e.g., disabling extensions, setting install prefix, version checks). No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code. The script performs standard setup tasks with environment-based configuration. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages setup parameters for building and installing a Python package. It reads environment variables to control extension building, installation paths, and version checks. It includes a conditional import of numpy and dynamically creates extension modules if extensions are enabled. No code appears to execute untrusted input or perform malicious actions. The code is well-structured and typical for a setup script, with no signs of malware, data leaks, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It uses environment variables for configuration and manages build parameters safely. No suspicious behaviors or malicious code elements are detected.",
