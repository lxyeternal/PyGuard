  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security issues, and the consistency of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The setup script manages build configuration, dependencies, and extension modules, with no malicious activity detected.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no untrusted data flow, no network activity, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is a standard setup script with typical environment variable controls and dependency management. No signs of malicious intent. The high confidence and zero scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a standard setup process with environment variable controls, dependency checks, and extension building.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no network activity, no obfuscation, only standard setup logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code appears benign. The slight securityRisk score (0.1) reflects a cautious approach, possibly due to environment variable influence, but no actual malicious activity is evident. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard setup with environment checks, dependency management, and extension building.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous assessments. The code is typical for package setup; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical setup script, managing dependencies, environment variables, and system info.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo issues detected; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, with detailed analysis of environment variables and build configuration.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no network activity, no obfuscation, standard setup logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAll signs point to a benign setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Code Presence of Malware:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low; environment variables are used for configuration, which is standard practice.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and minimal security risk, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package.\n- No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- Environment variables are used for configuration, which is common and not inherently risky.\n- No external network activity or data exfiltration observed.\n- The environment checks and dependency management are standard.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect the potential misuse of environment variables, but not a real risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, standard, and free from malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.",
