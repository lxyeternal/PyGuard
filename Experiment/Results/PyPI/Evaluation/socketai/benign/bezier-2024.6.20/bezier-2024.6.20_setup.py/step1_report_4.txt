{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for the 'bezier' Python package, handling installation, extension compilation, and environment checks.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, imports modules, reads README file, and checks system info.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or transmits untrusted data, nor does it execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence control flow, particularly for extension building and version checks; file I/O reads the README; module imports and function calls follow standard procedures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behaviors. Usage of environment variables to disable extensions is standard for configurable packages. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No network activity or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with environment-based configuration options, dependency management, and version checks. It loads modules safely, reads a README file, and configures extension modules based on environment variables. The control flow and code structure are typical for a setup script, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for the 'bezier' package. There are no indicators of malware, malicious backdoors, or security risks. It uses environment variables to manage build options in a typical manner and performs standard system checks. Overall, the code is benign and follows best practices for a setup script.",
