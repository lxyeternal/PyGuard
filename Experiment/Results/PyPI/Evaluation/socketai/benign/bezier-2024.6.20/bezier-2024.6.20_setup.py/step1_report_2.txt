{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the 'bezier' Python package, managing installation, dependencies, and extension modules.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, reads the README file, and retrieves package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potentially exits the process if environment variables are not set correctly or dependencies are missing; no data leaks or external connections are observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence conditional logic; reading README influences long_description; environment variables control extension building; process may terminate early on errors.",
  "anomalies": "Uses environment variables to control build behavior, which is normal; no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors identified. No obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package setup and installation logic. It performs environment checks, manages optional compilation of extension modules, and reads files for documentation. It exits on missing dependencies or incompatible Python versions but does not perform any suspicious actions such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. The logic appears standard for a setup script with appropriate safety checks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs environment checks, dependency management, and extension building with typical practices. No security risks or malicious activities are evident.",
