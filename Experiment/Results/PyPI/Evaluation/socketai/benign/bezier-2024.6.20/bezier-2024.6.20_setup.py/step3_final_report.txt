{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'bezier' Python package, managing dependencies, environment variables, and extension modules.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., BEZIER_NO_EXTENSION, BEZIER_INSTALL_PREFIX), reads README file, imports dependencies like numpy, setuptools, sys, os.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network activity, no data exfiltration, no code injection points.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence extension building and configuration; no data flows leading to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for build configuration is standard; no suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script. It performs dependency checks, environment variable handling, and extension module configuration in a straightforward manner. No suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The environment variables are used for configuration purposes, which is common practice. The code is clear, well-structured, and free from malicious payloads or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior, indicating a safe and standard package setup process.",
