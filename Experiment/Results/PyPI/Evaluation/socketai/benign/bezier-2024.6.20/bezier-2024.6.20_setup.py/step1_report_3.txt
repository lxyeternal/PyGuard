  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'bezier' Python package, configuring dependencies, extensions, and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, imports modules, reads README file, and gathers system info.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly evident; no untrusted data is directly executed or sent over network.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence extension module building; file I/O occurs for README; system info used for setup decisions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns identified. The script primarily performs standard setup tasks with environment-dependent configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, involving environment checks, conditional extension building, and package metadata. It reads environment variables to control build options, imports modules, and reads the README file. No indications of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All operations are standard for a package setup process. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard, benign setup file for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It correctly manages dependencies and build options without suspicious behavior.",
