{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions and imports for working with Bézier curves, polygons, and triangles, including optional speedup modules and configuration handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from the bezier package, including __config__, Curve, CurvedPolygon, Triangle, and UnsupportedDegree; reading the version and author info.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mostly imports modules and handles optional dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. The try-except for optional import is standard. No obfuscated code or misleading variables detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily for setting up a library, importing necessary components, handling optional speedup modules, and setting metadata (__author__, __version__). It includes a try-except block to handle import errors gracefully. No suspicious or malicious behavior, no data leakage, and no malicious code present. The code appears to be well-structured, with clear licensing and documentation comments. Overall, there are no indications of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard library setup and import module with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It performs necessary configuration and imports for the bezier package without any suspicious or harmful elements.",
