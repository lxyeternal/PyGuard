{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and imports for working with Bézier curves, polygons, and triangles, including support for performance optimizations.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, imports modules and optional speedup modules, and accesses the __config__ object for import error handling.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or used in a potentially harmful way.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; imports are static and configuration handling is straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden functions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of licensing comments, documentation strings, import statements, and exception handling for optional speedup modules. It manages dependencies and sets module-level attributes. The import error handler utilizes __config__.handle_import_error, which may handle errors but is not suspicious by itself. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks present. The code appears to be standard library setup with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, focusing on module initialization and import management without any malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
