  "purpose": "This code serves as the __init__.py for the 'bezier' Python package, providing imports, configuration handling, optional extension loading, and metadata definitions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for bezier modules, optional _speedup extension, and configuration handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data input or output operations.",
  "flows": "Initialization flow from imports to setting module attributes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package initializer, importing core modules, handling optional C extensions gracefully, and setting metadata. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks. The structure is straightforward, and the logic is benign. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are justified and appropriate.",
