  "purpose": "Helper module for performing geometric operations on Bézier curves, polygons, and triangles, including intersections, measurements, subdivision, and plotting.",
  "sources": "Imports from the bezier package and its submodules, including optional speedup module and handling import errors.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observed; the code primarily imports modules and sets up package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic are present. The handling of optional speedup module and import error is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes package metadata (__author__, __version__), imports key modules, and attempts to load an optional speedup extension with error handling. The __config__ import is prioritized, likely for shared library path modifications. The package exports key components via __all__. No input handling, data processing, or external data sources are involved. No suspicious or malicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, legitimate library setup file with standard import patterns and error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
