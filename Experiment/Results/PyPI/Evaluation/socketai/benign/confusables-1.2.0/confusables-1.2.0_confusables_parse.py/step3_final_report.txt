  "purpose": "Builds a Unicode confusable character map by reading mappings from files, extending with case and accented variants, and outputting a JSON file for normalization or security purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads mapping lines from CONFUSABLES_PATH and CUSTOM_CONFUSABLE_PATH files; processes each line for confusable characters.",
  "sinks": "Writes the final confusable character map to a JSON file; no other sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Reads mapping lines -> processes and extends mappings with case and accents -> recursively builds confusable groups -> writes JSON mapping.",
  "anomalies": "Potential IndexError risk when accessing mapping_line[1] without line length check; extensive unicode range (up to 137928) may cause performance issues; file handling for output lacks context manager, risking resource leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for constructing a Unicode confusable character map. It reads mappings, extends them with case and accented variants, and outputs a JSON file. No malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic execution is present. Minor issues include lack of line length validation before indexing and non-usage of context managers for file writing, which could be improved for robustness. The broad unicode range used in accent processing is resource-intensive but not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2—are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The overall assessment is that the code is a standard, safe utility with minimal security risk, suitable for normalization or spoofing detection purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for building a Unicode confusable character map, with no malicious intent or behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the code's straightforward and safe nature.",
