{
  "purpose": "The code reads configuration files to build a confusable character map for normalization or detection of similar characters, likely for security or input validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading from external files: CONFUSABLES_PATH and CUSTOM_CONFUSABLE_PATH.",
  "sinks": "Writing to a file: CONFUSABLE_MAPPING_PATH.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading mapping files -> processing character mappings -> writing the confusable map to a JSON file.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code or unusual control flow. Use of extensive character processing may be for obfuscation, but appears intended for normalization. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or backdoors. No suspicious external connections or code injections observed.",
  "analysis": "The script loads character mappings from external files, processes confusable characters (including accented and case variations), and generates a comprehensive confusable character map saved as JSON. It employs recursive functions to expand confusable groups. The code relies solely on file I/O and string processing without executing external commands or handling untrusted input dynamically. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident; it appears to be a utility for character normalization or similarity detection. The operations are standard and deterministic, with no hidden or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign character mapping utility with no malicious intent. It processes and generates character confusability mappings, likely for security or normalization purposes, with no evidence of malicious or sabotage activity.",
