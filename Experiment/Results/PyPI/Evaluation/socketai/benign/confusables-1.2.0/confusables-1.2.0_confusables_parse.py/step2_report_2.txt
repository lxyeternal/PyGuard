  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Reads Unicode confusable mappings from two files.\n- Extends mappings with case and accented variants.\n- Recursively builds groups of confusable characters.\n- Outputs a JSON mapping file.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscation.\n- Uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Construct confusable mapping for security/normalization.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, extensive unicode processing, benign utility.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is a utility for building confusable character maps, with no malicious activity. The low security risk score is reasonable, considering potential misuse if integrated improperly.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, standard file I/O, no malicious code.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, straightforward processing.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. The process is standard, with no malicious intent. The risk score could remain at 0, but 0.1 or 0.2 is also acceptable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same purpose.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, standard processing.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, standard character processing.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a benign utility for building Unicode confusable mappings.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior.\n- The risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are high, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** All should remain at 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher scores (~0.2) are acceptable if considering potential misuse, but 0 is also reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 - 0.2 (to reflect minimal risk if misused)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code's nature. The code is a standard, benign utility for Unicode confusable mapping, with no malware or obfuscation present.",
