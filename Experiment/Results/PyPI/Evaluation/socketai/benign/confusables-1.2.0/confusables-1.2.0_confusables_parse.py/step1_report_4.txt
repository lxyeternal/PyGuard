{
  "purpose": "This code processes Unicode confusables and generates a mapping of similar characters for normalization or spoofing detection.",
  "sources": "Reading from external files (CONFUSABLES_PATH, CUSTOM_CONFUSABLE_PATH), reading line data, and accessing system environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Writing JSON data to a file (CONFUSABLE_MAPPING_PATH).",
  "flows": "Reads Unicode mappings -> processes mappings to identify confusables -> writes processed map to a JSON file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials, no external network access, and no obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads Unicode confusable character mappings from specified files, processes these mappings to identify confusable characters with recursive expansion, and then saves the resulting confusable map to a JSON file. It uses standard library functions and safe file operations. There are no indications of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The logic appears to be for normalization or anti-spoofing purposes without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate processing of Unicode confusables and writes the processed data to a file. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent. It is a utility script with no security risks or malicious activity.",
