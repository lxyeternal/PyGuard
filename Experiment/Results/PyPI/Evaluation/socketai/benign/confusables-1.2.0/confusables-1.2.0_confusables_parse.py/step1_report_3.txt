{
  "purpose": "The code constructs a confusable character mapping by reading Unicode mappings, custom mappings, and accentuated characters, then serializes this mapping to a JSON file for later use.",
  "sources": "Reads from external files CONFUSABLES_PATH and CUSTOM_CONFUSABLE_PATH, and reads string data from these files during parsing.",
  "sinks": "Writes the resulting CONFUSABLE_MAP JSON object to a file at CONFUSABLE_MAPPING_PATH.",
  "flows": "Reads Unicode confusable mappings, processes them to build a character confusability graph, then writes the final JSON mapping to a file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious activity detected. The code manipulates Unicode characters and file I/O in a standard manner.",
  "analysis": "The code loads Unicode confusable character mappings from specified files, processes these to build a mapping of characters to their confusable counterparts, including accented and case variants, and then writes this mapping as JSON. The functions are straightforward, with file reading, string processing, and JSON output. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The processing appears to be for character normalization or similarity detection, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard character mapping builder that reads Unicode data, processes it, and writes the result to a file. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign utility for handling Unicode confusability.",
