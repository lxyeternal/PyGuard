{
  "purpose": "The function checks if all characters in a given string are ASCII characters.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'string' is the source of data being read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data affects external systems, leaks, or performs actions beyond returning a boolean.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the input 'string' through a loop that inspects each character, returning False if any non-ASCII character is found, otherwise returning True after the loop completes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a straightforward ASCII check without hidden or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code iterates over each character in the provided string, checking if the Unicode code point is 128 or higher. If such a character is found, it returns False, indicating the string contains non-ASCII characters. If no such characters are found, it returns True. The implementation is simple, clear, and standard for an ASCII validation function. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility function that performs ASCII validation. It shows no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The code appears safe and straightforward.",
