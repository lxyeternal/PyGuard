  "purpose": "Check if a string contains only ASCII characters by verifying that each character's Unicode code point is less than 128.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'string' (reads the string to validate).",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not write to files, network, or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input 'string' is iterated character-by-character; no external data flows or manipulations occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The function iterates over each character in the input string, checking if 'ord(char) >= 128'. If any character exceeds this value, it returns False, indicating non-ASCII characters are present. Otherwise, it completes the loop and returns True, confirming all characters are ASCII. The code is simple, correct, and performs a standard ASCII validation without external dependencies or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward ASCII validation function with no malicious intent or security issues. It performs as intended, with no anomalies or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible, and malware likelihood is zero.",
