{
  "purpose": "The function checks if a given string consists solely of ASCII characters.",
  "sources": "Input is received as the parameter 'string'.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sinks are present; the code only processes the input string locally.",
  "flows": "The input 'string' is iterated character by character, with each character's Unicode code point checked to determine if it is ASCII.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a simple check; there are no unusual or suspicious behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The function iterates through each character of the input string, checking whether the Unicode code point is below 128 (standard ASCII range). If any character exceeds this, the function returns False; otherwise, it returns True after complete iteration. The logic is straightforward and does not involve external calls, data leakage, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a basic utility function to verify ASCII-only strings with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
