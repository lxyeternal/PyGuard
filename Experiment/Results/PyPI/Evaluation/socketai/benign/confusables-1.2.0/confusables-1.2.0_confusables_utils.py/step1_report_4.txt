  "purpose": "Check if a string contains only ASCII characters",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'string' passed to the function",
  "sinks": "Return statement indicating the result; no external data sinks or outputs observed",
  "flows": "Input string -> iteration over each character -> ord() conversion -> comparison -> return result",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated elements, straightforward implementation",
  "analysis": "The function iterates over each character in the input string, checks if its Unicode code point is less than 128, and returns False if any character is non-ASCII. Otherwise, it returns True. The code is simple, direct, and does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious actions. There are no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function to verify ASCII-only strings. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks. The overall security risk score is minimal.",
