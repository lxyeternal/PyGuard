  "purpose": "The function checks whether all characters in a given string are ASCII characters.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'string' passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; the function only performs a local check.",
  "flows": "Input string is iterated character by character, with a comparison to determine ASCII status.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and performs a simple validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that iterates over each character of the input string, using ord() to get its Unicode code point, and returns False if any character has a code point >= 128, indicating non-ASCII. If all characters are below 128, it returns True. There are no external data sources, no data sinks, and no complex or suspicious logic. The code does not read environment variables, connect to networks, or include obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign ASCII validation check with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a simple utility function without malicious intent.",
