{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'confusables' Python package, providing metadata and package data files for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description; importing setuptools and os modules; no external input sources; no user input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, network calls, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink, as the code solely performs static setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected. The code performs standard package setup operations without any obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, reads a README file for the long description, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata and data files. There are no dynamic code executions, no external data inputs during runtime, and no suspicious activities such as network connections, credential handling, or obfuscation. It appears to be a typical setup script for packaging Python code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks identified. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security flaws.",
