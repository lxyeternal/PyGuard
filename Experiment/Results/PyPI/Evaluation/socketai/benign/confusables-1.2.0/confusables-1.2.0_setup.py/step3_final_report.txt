  "purpose": "Package setup script for a Python library named 'confusables', providing metadata and package data configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description, static package metadata inputs.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs processed.",
  "flows": "Static data assignment from local files and package configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static setup code with no dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools, reading a local README file, and configuring package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. All reports confirm the benign, typical nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code's purpose is solely package configuration, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the reports' assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
