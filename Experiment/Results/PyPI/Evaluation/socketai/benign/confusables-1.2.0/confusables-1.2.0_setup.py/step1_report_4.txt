{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'confusables' Python package, primarily to define package metadata and data files.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for the long_description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that execute untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' into 'long_description'; package setup and data inclusion are static and do not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. No dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and 'os' modules, then reads a local 'README.md' file for the package's long description. It calls 'setuptools.setup()' with static metadata, including package data files. All operations are standard for a Python package setup, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious content. It does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or execute untrusted code.",
