  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but no specific purpose is explicitly provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables and possibly from input parameters or external files, depending on implementation details.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but specifics are not provided in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input parameters to sinks like network or file system operations, potentially passing through processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution are detected. However, lack of detailed context limits full assessment.",
  "analysis": "The code shows standard structure with clear separation of functions and minimal complexity. No signs of malicious obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are evident. The code does not perform dangerous operations like system shell execution, network data exfiltration, or cryptomining. Usage of external libraries is not suspicious by itself. Given the absence of embedded secrets or malicious patterns, the code appears benign based on available details.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be normal utility code without malicious intent. However, due to limited context, a cautious low to moderate confidence is maintained.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
