{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that performs some data processing or computation, possibly for a utility or application feature.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from command-line arguments and possibly from environment variables or configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Outputs results to console or writes to local files. No network or system modification functions are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (command-line/env) through processing functions to outputs (console/files).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network connections, no unusual or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads inputs from trusted sources such as command-line arguments or environment variables, processes them via standard functions, and outputs results to standard output or local files. There are no signs of malicious data handling, unsafe code patterns, or obfuscated constructs. The overall structure and syntax are consistent with typical Python scripts. Without external network calls or system modifications, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment. It is a straightforward utility script with no suspicious features.",
