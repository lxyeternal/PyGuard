  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing, reading from environment variables, command-line arguments, or user input, and outputs to console or files. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, command-line arguments, user input",
  "sinks": "Console output, file writes, potential network or system calls (not explicitly shown)",
  "flows": "Input sources to output sinks via standard functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, handling inputs and outputs without evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. Confidence is high (0.9), and the risk is very low (0.1-0.2). No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation detected. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the described behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk and malware scores are appropriate, and the confidence level reflects the limited but clear information. No adjustments are necessary.",
