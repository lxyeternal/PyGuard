  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple utility or script, but no explicit purpose is provided in the snippet.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables and user input via the input() function.",
  "sinks": "Uses print statements and potentially writes to files or network if present, but none are explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or user input to output functions like print(), with no complex or suspicious flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables and user input, processes or displays them using standard functions. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network activity, file manipulation, or data exfiltration are observed. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, is not suspicious by itself. The code structure is straightforward and does not exhibit signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and intended for basic input/output operations.",
