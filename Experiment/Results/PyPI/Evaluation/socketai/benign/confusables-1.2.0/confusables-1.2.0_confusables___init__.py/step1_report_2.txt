{
  "purpose": "The code appears to handle the detection and normalization of confusable Unicode characters, likely for security or input validation purposes, to prevent homograph or spoofing attacks.",
  "sources": "Reads confusable character mappings from a JSON file located relative to the current module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs are present in this code; no network, file write, or external data transmission occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads confusable mappings -> uses them to identify confusable characters -> normalizes input strings based on confusable characters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The code uses file I/O to load configuration data. No obfuscated or dynamically executed code is present. No suspicious external communication or side effects are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a confusable character mapping from a local JSON file. It provides functions to check if two strings are confusable, generate regex patterns for confusable characters, and normalize strings by replacing characters with their confusable equivalents. The code relies on external configuration files and utility functions (e.g., is_ascii), but all operations appear to be for character normalization and spoofing detection. No malicious code or activities are evident. The structure is straightforward, with clear separation of functions for different tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for handling Unicode confusables and normalization, likely for security purposes such as input validation or anti-spoofing measures. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The risk is minimal, and the code appears to be benign.",
