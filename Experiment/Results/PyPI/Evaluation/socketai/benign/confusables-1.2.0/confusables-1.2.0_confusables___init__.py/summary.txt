  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for Unicode confusability detection and normalization, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external configuration trust. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0, and the overall risk score is low (~0.15). The reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment."
