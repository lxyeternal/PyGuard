  "purpose": "Unicode confusable detection and normalization to prevent homograph spoofing attacks.",
  "sources": "Reading confusable character mappings from external JSON file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; functions process strings internally.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through confusable_characters, is_confusable, confusable_regex, and normalize functions without external data or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads confusable Unicode mappings from an external JSON file, then provides functions to check if two strings are confusable, generate regex patterns for confusable characters, and normalize strings based on these mappings. It performs standard string and regex operations for Unicode spoof detection. No malicious behaviors, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The reliance on external configuration is typical but could be a risk if the file is tampered with, though this is outside the code's scope. The functions are straightforward and serve security purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for Unicode confusability detection and normalization, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external configuration trust. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0, and the overall risk score is low (~0.15). The reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
