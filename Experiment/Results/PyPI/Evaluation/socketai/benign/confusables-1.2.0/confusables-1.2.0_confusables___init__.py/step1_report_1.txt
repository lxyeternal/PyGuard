{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform operations related to identifying and handling confusable Unicode characters, potentially for security or input validation purposes, such as detecting spoofing or obfuscation in strings.",
  "sources": "Reads confusable character mappings from a JSON file specified by CONFUSABLE_MAPPING_PATH; uses os.path and open to load data; reads input strings in functions like is_confusable and normalize.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution functions are present; functions process strings internally without external interactions or outputs.",
  "flows": "Loads confusable mappings -> Checks character confusability -> Builds regex patterns -> Normalizes strings based on confusability mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or unusual code structures; code relies on external configuration files, which is standard for such utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code loads confusable character mappings from a JSON file, then provides functions to detect if two strings are confusable, generate regex for confusable characters, and normalize strings based on confusability. The logic involves reading external data, performing string manipulations, and regex pattern creation. There are no suspicious behaviors like network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions are typical for Unicode normalization and spoof detection. The code depends on external files but does not include any malicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for handling confusable Unicode characters, likely for security purposes such as detecting spoofed or obfuscated input. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behaviors. It uses external configuration files appropriately, with no suspicious code patterns.",
