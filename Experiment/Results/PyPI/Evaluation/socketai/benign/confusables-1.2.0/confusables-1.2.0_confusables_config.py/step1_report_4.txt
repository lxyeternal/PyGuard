  "purpose": "Define configuration constants for handling confusables, including file paths, similarity depth, and non-normal ASCII characters.",
  "sources": "File paths specified as string constants; these indicate where data might be read from.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network or database operations are present; only file paths are defined.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs within this snippet; it simply assigns constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed; the variables are straightforward configuration constants.",
  "analysis": "The code defines file paths and constants used likely for confusables processing, possibly in a module that compares or normalizes text. No data input/output operations or dynamic code execution is present. There is a single non-normal ASCII character list with '@', which is standard and not suspicious. No malicious patterns or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to be benign configuration setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
