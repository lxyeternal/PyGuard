  "purpose": "Define constants and file paths related to confusable characters and mappings for a text processing or security validation module.",
  "sources": "String literals assigned to variables, indicating file paths and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code only assigns string values and a list.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this code only initializes constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward variable assignments with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code sets constants for file paths, a maximum similarity depth, and a list of non-normal ASCII characters. It appears to be part of a larger module handling confusability or normalization checks. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any actions that could compromise security or indicate sabotage.",
