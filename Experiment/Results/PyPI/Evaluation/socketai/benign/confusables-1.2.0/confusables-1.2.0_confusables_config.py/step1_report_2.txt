  "purpose": "Define configuration constants for handling confusable characters and mappings, likely for text processing or security purposes.",
  "sources": "File paths: 'assets/custom_confusables.txt', 'assets/confusables.txt', 'assets/confusable_mapping.json'. These indicate data is read from these files.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct data sinks such as network operations, system modifications, or untrusted data output in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the file paths into the program for loading confusable characters and mappings, but no actual data processing or flow is shown in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets beyond file paths. The variable 'NON_NORMAL_ASCII_CHARS' contains a suspicious character '@', but its usage appears benign given the context.",
  "analysis": "This code segment only sets constants for file paths and a list of non-normal ASCII characters. It does not perform any data processing, input reading, or output. There are no functions, network operations, or code execution shown. Since it is only variable declarations, there are no apparent security issues, malicious behaviors, or anomalies beyond potential misinterpretation of the '@' character, which by itself is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears to be configuration setup for text normalization or confusable character handling, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior.",
