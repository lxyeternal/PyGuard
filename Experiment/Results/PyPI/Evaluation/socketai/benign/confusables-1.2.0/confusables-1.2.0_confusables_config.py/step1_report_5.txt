  "purpose": "Define constants for file paths and configuration parameters related to confusables detection and similarity analysis.",
  "sources": "None (no data input or user input is read in this snippet).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data handling or output occurs in this snippet).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow between sources and sinks in this code).",
  "anomalies": "Presence of file path constants and a list of non-normal ASCII characters; no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static configuration parameters, including file paths for assets and a list for non-normal ASCII characters. There is no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The constants appear to support a confusables detection or normalization process, which is standard in text processing or security filtering modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration setup for a text processing or confusables detection system. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks within this snippet.",
