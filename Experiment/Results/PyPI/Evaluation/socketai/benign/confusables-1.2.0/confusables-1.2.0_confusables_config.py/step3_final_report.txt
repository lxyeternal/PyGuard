  "purpose": "Define configuration constants for confusability handling, including file paths, similarity parameters, and character lists.",
  "sources": "File path variables and character list definitions",
  "sinks": "None; static configuration data",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or dynamic processing",
  "anomalies": "Presence of absolute file paths and inclusion of '@' in character list, but these are benign configuration choices",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions with no dynamic code, input/output, or network activity. The file paths are hardcoded, which could reduce flexibility but do not pose security risks. The '@' character in the character list is standard and not suspicious. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is correctly 0, as there is no malicious intent. The security risk score is 0, justified by the static, benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9 to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration data related to confusability handling, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
