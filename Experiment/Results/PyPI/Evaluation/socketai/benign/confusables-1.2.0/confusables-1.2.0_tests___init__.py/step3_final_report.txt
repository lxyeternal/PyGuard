  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network/file operations, potential dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/env) to sinks (network, file, subprocess), potentially via dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Potential dynamic execution ('exec'), network calls, or environment variable usage without full context; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign based on descriptions, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. The risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting minimal threat. The confidence is high (0.7-0.75), given the lack of concrete code snippets but cautious assessments. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present. The potential for dynamic features is noted but unconfirmed, justifying low malware and obfuscation scores. The security risk remains low (~0.2), consistent across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The risk levels are appropriately conservative, and the assessments are consistent with the provided descriptions. No revisions are necessary; the overall security posture is benign.",
