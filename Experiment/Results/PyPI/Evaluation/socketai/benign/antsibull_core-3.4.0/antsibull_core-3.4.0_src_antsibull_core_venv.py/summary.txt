  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for managing Python virtual environments and executing commands safely. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily associated with subprocess execution, which is properly validated. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting inherent subprocess risks but well-controlled."
