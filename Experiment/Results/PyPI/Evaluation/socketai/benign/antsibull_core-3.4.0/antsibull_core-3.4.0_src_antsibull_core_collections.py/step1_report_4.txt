  "purpose": "Manage installation of collection tarballs into specified directories, supporting both combined and separate installation modes.",
  "sources": "File paths from 'collection_tarballs' parameter, reading tarball filenames and directory paths.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'tar' commands via async_log_run, creation of directories with os.makedirs and os.mkdir.",
  "flows": "Paths from tarball filenames to directory creation, then to extraction commands executed via async_log_run.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Directory creation modes are strict (0o700). The code performs standard file operations with no external network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code reads tarball file paths, extracts package names and versions, creates directories with controlled permissions, and extracts archive contents into these directories. The use of asyncio for parallel execution and standard library functions suggests typical package installation behavior. No suspicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification beyond file extraction are present. The filenames are expected to follow a specific format, with error handling in case of unexpected formats. No malicious or sabotage indicators detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform legitimate installation tasks for collection tarballs, with appropriate permission controls and no signs of malicious intent. It is standard package management logic with no malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
