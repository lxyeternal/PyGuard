{
  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for argument parsing and configuration validation in CLI programs, specifically handling version and config file options.",
  "sources": "Reads package name for version retrieval, command line arguments for version and config files, and filesystem to verify config file existence.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potential vulnerabilities identified; filesystem access is only to verify file existence.",
  "flows": "Package name used to retrieve version -> command line args for version and config files -> filesystem checks on config files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated or malicious code structures. Exception handling for missing package metadata is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports metadata to determine package version, adds command line arguments for version and config files, and validates config file existence. No external data or untrusted inputs are processed in a way that could lead to security issues. All filesystem checks are for existence verification only. No malicious or harmful behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard argument parsing helper module with no malicious intent or security risks. It mainly handles argument definitions and validation, with no suspicious or malicious actions evident.",
