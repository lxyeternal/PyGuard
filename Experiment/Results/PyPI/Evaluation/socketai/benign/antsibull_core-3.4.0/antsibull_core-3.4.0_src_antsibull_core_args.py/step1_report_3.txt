{
  "purpose": "Provide argument parsing helpers for CLI programs, including version and configuration file handling.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata to determine version; reading 'config_file' argument input; checking file existence on disk.",
  "sinks": "os.path.isfile() used to validate existence of config files; potential exception raising when files are missing.",
  "flows": "Input from command line for --config-file propagates through normalization, which checks file existence; version info retrieved from package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected; use of standard library functions and clear exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard argument parser setup with version retrieval and config file validation. It uses 'importlib.metadata' to get package version info and argparse for CLI handling. The only validation performed is checking for file existence of config files. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated elements are present. The exception handling is normal for missing files, and no secrets or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for argument parsing with standard, safe operations. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present. It performs legitimate tasks without suspicious side effects or hidden functionalities.",
