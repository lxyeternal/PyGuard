{
  "purpose": "The code provides argument parsing helpers for CLI programs, including version display and configuration file handling.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, specifically '--version' and '--config-file'; accesses package metadata via importlib.metadata.version(); checks file existence with os.path.isfile().",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data into system commands, network, or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Command-line inputs are processed for '--config-file' paths, which are then validated for existence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The only operation is file existence checking for user-specified config files.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard libraries for argument parsing and package metadata. It handles user-specified config files and provides version info. The only validation is ensuring config files exist before use, which is a normal security check. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are present. No obfuscation or malware signatures detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard argument parser helper with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply validates user-provided config files and handles version info. There are no indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
