{
  "purpose": "Provides argument parsing helpers for CLI programs, including version display and config file validation.",
  "sources": "Retrieves package version via importlib.metadata, reads command-line arguments, and checks existence of specified config files.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; only filesystem existence checks.",
  "flows": "Source: package metadata and user-supplied config file paths; Sink: existence validation; Flow: metadata retrieval and validation steps.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for argument parsing, retrieving package version info, adding '--version' and '--config-file' options, and validating that config files exist. It uses standard libraries with clear logic. No network activity, code injection, or malicious payloads are present. The validation is limited to file existence checks, which is a common and benign operation. The code is not obfuscated and contains no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI argument helper module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are correctly assigned as malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, and are justified by the code's simplicity and safety.",
