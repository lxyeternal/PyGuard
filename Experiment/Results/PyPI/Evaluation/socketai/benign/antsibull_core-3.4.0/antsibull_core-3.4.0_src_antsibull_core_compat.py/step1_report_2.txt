  "purpose": "Provides compatibility for older Python versions regarding argparse features.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version information from sys.version_info; imports modules sys and argparse; conditionally imports vendored module for specific Python versions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows identified; no external data inputs or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Python version check leads to conditional import of a vendored module or standard library.",
  "anomalies": "Use of vendored code as a compatibility workaround; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the Python runtime version and conditionally imports a specific implementation of BooleanOptionalAction from either the standard library or a vendored module for compatibility. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The vendored import is a common practice for maintaining compatibility. The code structure is standard and purpose-driven, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility shim for older Python versions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It employs normal practices for version-based conditional imports.",
