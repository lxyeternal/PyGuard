  "purpose": "Provide compatibility handling for older Python versions, especially related to argparse's BooleanOptionalAction.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, imports (argparse, sys), vendored module import.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data sinks or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "Conditional logic based on Python version to determine whether to use built-in or vendored BooleanOptionalAction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward compatibility logic. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version compatibility and conditionally imports a vendored version of a class if the environment does not support the desired feature natively. The purpose is to maintain compatibility across different Python versions. There are no data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors present. The code appears to be standard and legitimate, focused solely on ensuring correct import behavior depending on environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility shim for Python version differences in argparse. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The logic is straightforward and pertains solely to version compatibility.",
