  "purpose": "Provide compatibility support for older Python versions related to argparse BooleanOptionalAction.",
  "sources": "The code reads Python version information from sys.version_info and imports a vendored module if needed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, no external data or user input handling beyond standard library calls.",
  "flows": "Python version check -> conditional import -> assignment of BooleanOptionalAction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard library imports and version checks, with a fallback import of a vendored module.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles compatibility by checking Python version and conditionally importing a class from either the standard library or a vendored module. No user input, network access, or untrusted data flows are present. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are detected. The import from a local vendored path is standard for maintaining compatibility and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward compatibility shim with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It responsibly manages imports based on environment, with no suspicious activities detected.",
