  "purpose": "Provide compatibility for older Python versions by importing or defining BooleanOptionalAction.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version detection, import statements for argparse and sys modules, conditional import of vendored module.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data handling or external connections.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info check -> conditional import -> assignment of BooleanOptionalAction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard compatibility code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python interpreter version to decide whether to import BooleanOptionalAction from argparse or from a vendored source. This is a common compatibility pattern. No user input, no data leaks, no suspicious code patterns are present. The vendored module is imported only if the Python version is below certain thresholds. The code does not contain any obfuscation, malicious commands, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility shim for older Python versions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured and standard.",
