  "purpose": "Provides compatibility support for 'BooleanOptionalAction' in argparse across different Python versions by conditionally importing either the standard library or a vendored module based on version checks.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info via sys.version_info; imports either standard library or vendored module accordingly.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external inputs, or network interactions are involved.",
  "flows": "Version check leads to conditional import of 'BooleanOptionalAction' from different sources.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward version-based conditional import for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a version check to determine whether to import 'BooleanOptionalAction' from the standard library or a vendored module. It uses a simple conditional statement with well-defined version thresholds, ensuring compatibility across Python versions. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The vendored import is a common pattern for maintaining backward compatibility. The code is clear, purpose-driven, and employs standard practices without any suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility shim that performs version checks and imports accordingly. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and justified.",
