  "purpose": "YAML handling utilities for loading and storing YAML data.",
  "sources": "The imported functions could potentially load or store data from or to files or streams.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; however, functions like load_yaml_bytes and load_yaml_file can process external input data, and store_yaml_file/stream can write data to files or streams.",
  "flows": "Potential flow: External YAML data → load_yaml_bytes/load_yaml_file → process data → store_yaml_file/store_yaml_stream → external storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs present. No dynamic execution or unsafe behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports functions related to YAML processing without any additional logic or data handling. There are no apparent sources or sinks in this snippet; it just sets up imports. The code's purpose appears to be utility-based, and no malicious or suspicious activity is indicated by these imports. The license comments are standard and do not suggest malicious intent. Overall, this fragment does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import setup for YAML utilities with no suspicious or malicious activity. It appears to be a benign component of a larger project, with no evident security risks.",
