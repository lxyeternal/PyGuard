  "purpose": "Import statements for YAML handling functions from the antsibull_fileutils.yaml module, intended for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "The import statements themselves; no data reading occurs here.",
  "sinks": "None in this snippet; potential sinks would be in functions that utilize these imports, but not present here.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present within this code snippet; it only sets up imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard license comments and unused import disable directive.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for YAML utility functions, with no data processing, execution, or dynamic behavior. The comments are licensing info, and the disable directive indicates these imports are used elsewhere. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The assigned malware score is 0, security risk score is 0.1 at most, and confidence is high, reflecting the benign and standard nature of this setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility setup for YAML processing with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
