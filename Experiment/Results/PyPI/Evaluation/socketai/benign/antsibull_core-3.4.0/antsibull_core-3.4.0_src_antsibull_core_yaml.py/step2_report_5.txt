  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is purely import statements for YAML utility functions.\n- No data processing, execution, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The license comments are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.\n- The functions are imported from a known utility package (`antsibull_fileutils.yaml`).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code snippet does **not** contain any malicious activity, data flow, or security flaw.\n- The functions are imported but not invoked, so no data is processed or stored here.\n- The code is benign and intended as utility setup.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report:\n- The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0 or very low, consistent with the benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is reasonable given the straightforward code.\n- No report mentions any suspicious behavior or assumptions that could be challenged.\n\n### Score justifications:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of data handling, the risk score should be near zero. Some reports assign 0.1, which might be slightly conservative but acceptable, considering potential misuse if these functions are used improperly elsewhere.\n- **Sinks/Flows:** Since the code only imports functions, there are no active data flows or sinks here.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are generally reasonable.\n- The **securityRisk** could be uniformly set to 0, given no evidence of vulnerability or malicious activity.\n- The **malware** score should remain 0.\n- The **obfuscated** score should remain 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Overall, the code is a benign utility module with no security issues.** The reports are consistent with this, and the scores reflect the benign nature.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **malware:** 0\n- **obfuscated:** 0\n- **securityRisk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is straightforward import statements for YAML functions.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or vulnerable behavior is present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and should be maintained as such.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code poses no security concern.",
