  "purpose": "Shared code used by tools for building the Ansible distribution",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; metadata and imports are present",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code mainly defines metadata and module exports",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists of license headers, version information, and module exports. It imports __future__ for compatibility and sets version and __all__ attributes. No user input handling, network operations, or data processing occurs. The code does not contain any obfuscated segments, malicious behavior, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, serving as a module metadata definition without any suspicious or malicious content.",
