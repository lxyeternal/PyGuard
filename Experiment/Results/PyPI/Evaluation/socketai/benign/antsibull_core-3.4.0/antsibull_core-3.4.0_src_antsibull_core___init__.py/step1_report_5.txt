{
  "purpose": "Shared code used by tools for building the Ansible distribution",
  "sources": "The code imports __future__ annotations and defines module metadata (__version__, __all__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks, no sensitive operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets metadata",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any code performing data processing, network access, or security-sensitive operations; very minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module header containing license comments, metadata, and an import statement. No data input, output, or execution of suspicious activities. It does not contain any malware, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. It is standard module boilerplate code for versioning and metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended for distribution metadata, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.",
