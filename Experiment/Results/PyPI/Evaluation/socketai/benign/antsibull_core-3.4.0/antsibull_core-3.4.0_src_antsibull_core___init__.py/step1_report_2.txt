  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code does not process input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of licensing comments, version declaration, and module exports. It imports annotations for future compatibility and defines a version string and an exported list. There are no dynamic or unsafe operations, no user input processing, and no network or file interactions. The code appears standard and benign, serving as a module metadata descriptor.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard module metadata with no malicious or security concerns. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
