  "purpose": "Shared code used by tools for building the Ansible distribution",
  "sources": "Import statements, version assignment, and metadata comments",
  "targets": "No specific sinks or data processing, only metadata and imports",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily defines constants and metadata",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "This code is a straightforward module defining version information and metadata for the Ansible project. It includes only licensing comments, import statements, and constant definitions. No input/output operations, network activity, or data handling occurs. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is standard for Python packages and contains no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as metadata and module initialization for the project. There are no indications of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
