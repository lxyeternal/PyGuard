  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n**Code Content Summary:**\n- Licensing comments (GPL v3.0+)\n- Import of `__future__.annotations`\n- Definition of `__version__ = \"3.4.0\"`\n- Export of `__all__ = (\"__version__\",)`\n\n**Security Perspective:**\n- No data inputs, outputs, or data flows.\n- No network, file, or user input handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive data.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code serves as a metadata module for versioning and licensing info.\n\n**Review of the Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, containing only metadata, licensing comments, and simple variable definitions.\n- They assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n- Confidence is perfect (1), which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n\n**Critical Analysis:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or introduce vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and align with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or errors:**\n- None identified. The reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- No need to adjust scores or reasoning.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis is straightforward, benign boilerplate code with no security concerns. The provided reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the existing reports and the code's nature.",
