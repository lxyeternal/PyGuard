  "purpose": "Metadata and versioning information for the Ansible distribution, including license comments and module exports.",
  "sources": "License comments, import statements, version string assignment (__version__), and __all__ export list.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, network activity, or data processing points; the code does not interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code contains no data flows or dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module with licensing comments, a version variable, and an export list. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or network operations. The absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads indicates a benign purpose. All reports correctly identify the code as metadata-only, with no security concerns. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and static nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as metadata for versioning and licensing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and analysis are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
