  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is minimal, consisting of licensing comments, import statements, version variables, and exports.\n   - There are no data sources, sinks, or flows, and no executable logic, input/output handling, or dynamic behavior.\n   - The code is purely metadata, serving as a module header or version indicator.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are detected.\n   - No network, file, or data processing operations are present.\n   - The code appears standard and benign.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are consistent with the code content.\n   - The confidence score is 1, which seems appropriate given the thorough reasoning.\n\n4. **Potential for Hidden Risks:**\n   - Given the simplicity, there is no basis for higher risk scores.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n   - The lack of obfuscation or suspicious patterns supports the low scores.\n\n5. **Any discrepancies or issues?**\n   - No. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The scores are appropriate and justified based on the code's nature.\n\n6. **Overall assessment:**\n   - The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The reports are thorough and correct.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- I would not change any scores.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence remains at 1, as the analysis is straightforward.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\nThis code is purely metadata and license information, posing no security threat.",
