  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for pca-connector-scep service in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, datetime, and type definitions from local modules and standard libraries. Reads type annotations for request/response structures.",
  "sinks": "None; code primarily defines types and data structures without executing untrusted data or performing IO operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code consists of type definitions and imports, with no runtime data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is standard type definitions with conditional imports based on Python version, no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type annotations for a Python package, including conditional imports for compatibility, and defines various TypedDict classes for API request and response schemas. No code executes at runtime besides imports and type definitions. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious logic are present. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The structure is consistent with typical SDK or API client type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for type annotations and data structure definitions, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard, well-structured type declaration code with no suspicious behavior.",
