{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for pca-connector-scep service, mainly used for data validation and documentation in AWS SDKs.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type annotations, class definitions, and constants.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions on external systems.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines data structures; there are no data flow paths involving untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. Usage of conditional imports based on sys.version_info is standard practice for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of type annotations, class definitions, and import logic for compatibility. It does not include any runtime logic, external data handling, or network communication. No evidence of obfuscated code or malicious payloads. The code appears to be standard, well-structured type definition code for an AWS SDK module.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only type definitions and import compatibility logic, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is a typical schema module for data validation, and there are no signs of malware or security threats.",
