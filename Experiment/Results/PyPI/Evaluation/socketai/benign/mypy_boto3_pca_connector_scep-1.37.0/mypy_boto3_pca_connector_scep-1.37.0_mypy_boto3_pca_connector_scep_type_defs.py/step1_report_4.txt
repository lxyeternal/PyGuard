  "purpose": "Type definitions for pca-connector-scep service for use with boto3 stubs, primarily for API request/response schemas.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, datetime, and local literals; type annotations for TypedDict, List, Dict, Sequence, NotRequired.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no code that executes data manipulation or untrusted data handling; only type annotations and data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "No executable flows; only data structure declarations and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic typing conditional imports based on sys.version_info; no suspicious logic or code execution present; no hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type annotations and data structure definitions using TypedDict and conditional imports to ensure compatibility across Python versions. There is no code logic, input handling, data processing, or network operations. No source-to-sink flows or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type definitions intended for API schema validation or code hinting. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward collection of type definitions for API request/response schemas, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a standard part of SDK or stub generation code, primarily used for type checking and documentation.",
