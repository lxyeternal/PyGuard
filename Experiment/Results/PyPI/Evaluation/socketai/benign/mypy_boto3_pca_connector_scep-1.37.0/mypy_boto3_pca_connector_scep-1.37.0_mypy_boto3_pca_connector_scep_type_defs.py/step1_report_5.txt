{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and annotations for the pca-connector-scep service, providing structured data types for API requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, builtins, collections.abc, typing, and typing_extensions; usage of constants from .literals; type definitions using TypedDict and dynamic creation via TypedDict().",
  "targets": "No specific code execution points or data sinks are present; the code solely defines data structures without runtime behavior.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code is purely type annotations and data structure definitions, with no executable data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs are evident. Usage of conditional imports based on Python version is standard practice for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code provides detailed type definitions for API request and response structures, employing conditional imports for compatibility with different Python versions. No dynamic execution, eval, exec, or runtime code manipulation is present. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. All imported modules are standard or for type annotations. The file is a comprehensive set of structured data types for API interactions, with no runtime logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is solely a set of type definitions and annotations intended for static type checking and documentation. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The structure and content are consistent with standard SDK or API type definition files.",
