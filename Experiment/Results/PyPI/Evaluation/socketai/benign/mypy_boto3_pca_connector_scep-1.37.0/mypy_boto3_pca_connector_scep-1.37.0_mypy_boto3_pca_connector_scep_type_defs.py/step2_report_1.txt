  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll five reports describe the code as a set of static type definitions for the pca-connector-scep service, primarily used for API validation, documentation, and type checking. They emphasize that the code is straightforward, uses conditional imports for compatibility, and contains no executable logic, data handling beyond type annotations, or suspicious patterns. The reports consistently conclude that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is purely static type definitions with no executable logic, network operations, or data manipulation. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Errors or flaws:** None. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. The code's purpose is clear, and no logical errors are evident.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, correctly reflecting the code's transparency and straightforwardness.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the nature of the code as purely type definitions with no executable or data-processing logic.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is for static type annotations, with no runtime or malicious behavior.\n- The use of conditional imports based on `sys.version_info` is standard for compatibility and not suspicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The presence of copyright and documentation links suggests maintained, open-source code, not malicious obfuscation.\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the detailed analysis, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose as type definitions for an SDK or API client.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**In conclusion:** The code is purely static type annotations and data structure definitions, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.",
