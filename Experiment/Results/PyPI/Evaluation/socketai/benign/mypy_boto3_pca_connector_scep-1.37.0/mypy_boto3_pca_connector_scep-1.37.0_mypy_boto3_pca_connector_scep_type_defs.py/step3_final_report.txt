  "purpose": "Static type annotations and data structure definitions for the pca-connector-scep service API schemas, used for validation, documentation, and type checking.",
  "sources": "Definitions of TypedDict classes, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and static data structures; no runtime data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "None; as the code is purely static type definitions, there are no data flows from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard conditional imports and no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility. There are no executable functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The purpose is to define data schemas for API requests and responses, which is typical for SDK stub files. The code is well-structured, clear, and free of malicious or security-compromising elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of static type annotations for API schemas, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence points to it being a well-maintained, non-malicious component of an SDK or API client.",
