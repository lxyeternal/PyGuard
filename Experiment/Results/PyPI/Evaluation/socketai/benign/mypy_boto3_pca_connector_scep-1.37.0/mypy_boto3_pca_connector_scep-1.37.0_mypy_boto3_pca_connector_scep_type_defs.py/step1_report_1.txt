  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for pca-connector-scep service type definitions, used for API communication and data validation.",
  "sources": "Imports (sys, datetime, internal modules, typing extensions), class attribute assignments, and type annotations within TypedDict classes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources, as this code is purely defining types and data structures.",
  "flows": "N/A – The code is static type definitions with no executable logic or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. The code is straightforward, with version-dependent imports and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of TypedDict class definitions used for API request and response validation. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility. There are no dynamic executions, network operations, or data handling beyond type annotations. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are present. The presence of copyright and documentation links suggests maintained, open-source code. Overall, the code is static type definitions without executable logic or potential malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of safe, non-executable type definitions intended for static type checking and data validation within a larger project. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
