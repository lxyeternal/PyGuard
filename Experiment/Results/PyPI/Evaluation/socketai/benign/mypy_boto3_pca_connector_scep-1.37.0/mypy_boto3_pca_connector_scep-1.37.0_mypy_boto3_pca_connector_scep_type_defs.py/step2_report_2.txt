  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clarifies that the code defines static type annotations for the pca-connector-scep service, primarily for API validation.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No data flow or suspicious behavior; purely static definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No executable logic, no malicious patterns, no secrets. The code is straightforward, with standard conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Risk Assessment:** No malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The confidence is high (1.0).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the static nature of the code and its purpose for defining types.\n- No suspicious patterns, no dynamic code, no data leaks.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard type definitions with no malicious intent.\n- **Risk Assessment:** Malware and obfuscation scores are zero; high confidence.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the code being purely type annotations for AWS SDK schemas.\n- No runtime logic, no external data handling, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard, well-structured type definitions.\n- **Risk Assessment:** Zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Highlights the use of conditional imports for compatibility and the absence of executable logic.\n- No suspicious patterns or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical SDK type definitions, safe and straightforward.\n- **Risk Assessment:** No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Emphasizes the code as purely static type definitions, with no runtime or executable logic.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe type annotation code.\n- **Risk Assessment:** Zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code consists solely of static type definitions using TypedDict, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and no executable logic.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Security Risks:** No data leaks, secrets, or risky behaviors.\n- **Confidence Level:** All reports indicate high confidence (1.0) that the code is safe.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Note:** The code is a typical, well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK or API client, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a safe, static type declaration module used for API validation and documentation. It does not contain executable logic, malicious patterns, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a risk score of zero.",
