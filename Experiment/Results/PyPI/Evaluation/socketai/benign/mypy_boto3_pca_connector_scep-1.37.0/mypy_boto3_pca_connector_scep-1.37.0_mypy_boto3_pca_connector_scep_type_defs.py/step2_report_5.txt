  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the code itself to determine if the assessments are accurate and whether any adjustments are warranted.\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n\n- The code is a collection of static type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- There are no executable functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code is purely structural, intended for type checking and API schema validation.\n- The presence of documentation links, copyright, and structured data definitions aligns with standard SDK or stub files.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Each Report\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, purely type annotations, no anomalies.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is static, safe, and standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no suspicious behavior, standard type definitions.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Type definitions for API schemas, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, standard type annotations, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same as others, purely type definitions, no runtime logic.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code. The code is purely static type definitions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation patterns, such as complex evals, encrypted strings, or confusing code structures.\n- **Risk Score:** Since there is no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions, the security risk is minimal or none.\n\n### My Overall Estimate\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward and transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. The code is a standard, safe set of type definitions for API data validation, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scores at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
