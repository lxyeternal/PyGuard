  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to determine if the assessments are accurate and consistent with the code provided.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely defining static type annotations and data structures for API request/response validation.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, network operations, or untrusted data handling are present.\n- The code uses conditional imports for Python version compatibility, which is standard practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as static type definitions for API schemas, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate; the confidence score of 1.0 is justified.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both scores are 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states the code is for type annotations and data structures, with no runtime or malicious logic.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate; high confidence, scores consistent.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both zero, appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above; no signs of malicious code, just type definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate; scores align.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Zero, consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly notes no code execution, only type annotations, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate; scores consistent.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Zero.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Also confirms the code is only static type definitions, with no runtime logic or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; high confidence, scores consistent.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Zero.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking the Scores:\n- All reports assign **malware = 0** and **obfuscated = 0**, which is correct given the static nature of the code.\n- The **risk scores** are all 0 or very low, which is appropriate since there's no security risk present.\n- The **confidence** scores are 1.0 or 1, reflecting certainty that the code is safe.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Code presence of issues:** None; the code is purely type definitions.\n- **Malware risk:** None; no malicious activity or payload.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; straightforward type annotations.\n- **Security risk:** None; no vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### My Expert Conclusion:\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, well-structured set of static type definitions for an SDK or API client, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the absence of any malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is safe, with no security concerns.",
