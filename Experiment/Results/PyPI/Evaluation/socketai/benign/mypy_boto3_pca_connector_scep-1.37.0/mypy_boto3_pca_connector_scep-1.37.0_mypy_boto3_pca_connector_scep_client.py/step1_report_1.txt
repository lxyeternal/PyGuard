  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS pca-connector-scep service client, enabling type-safe API calls in Python.",
  "sources": "Imported modules (sys, typing, botocore, local type_defs), class definitions, method definitions, property getters.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters and return values, especially in methods like generate_presigned_url, create_challenge, create_connector, and other API interaction methods.",
  "flows": "Input data (kwargs) from method calls flow into API request parameters; responses from API calls flow back into return types.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution or hidden network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a type stub and client interface definition for the AWS pca-connector-scep service, utilizing standard type annotations and inheritance from botocore. It defines API methods with clear input and output types, as well as property accessors for exceptions and pagination. No code appears malicious or performs any unauthorized actions. The presence of a copyright date in 2025 is suspicious but not malicious—likely a placeholder or typo. All methods adhere to standard SDK interface patterns, with no evidence of data exfiltration, hidden network calls, or code injection. There are no hardcoded secrets or unusual code flows. The code's structure indicates it's a generated interface for safe API interaction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured Python interface for AWS SDK with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely provides type annotations and method signatures for API calls. No suspicious or harmful code detected.",
