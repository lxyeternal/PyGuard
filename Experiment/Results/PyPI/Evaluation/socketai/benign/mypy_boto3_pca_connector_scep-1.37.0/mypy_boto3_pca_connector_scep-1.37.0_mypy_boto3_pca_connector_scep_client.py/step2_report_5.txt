  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and determine the appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a type stub/interface for AWS pca-connector-scep client, with no malicious or suspicious code. The mention of 2025 copyright is likely a placeholder.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no obfuscation, malware, or security risks. The analysis is thorough.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 seem appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code content. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard type annotations, no malicious activity, and typical AWS SDK patterns.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Consistent with the code. No changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard boto3 client interface, no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 fit well.\n\n**Conclusion:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical boto3 stub/interface, no suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Findings:** No network activity, data leaks, or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** No changes required.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others—standard type annotations, no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code is purely a type stub/interface for AWS SDK.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, and there's no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate as the code is benign.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated type stub for an AWS SDK client.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity, no obfuscation, no data exfiltration, no backdoors.\n- The only odd element is the copyright year 2025, which appears to be a placeholder or typo, but this is not malicious.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**These scores reflect the benign nature of the code.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate. No modifications needed. The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.",
