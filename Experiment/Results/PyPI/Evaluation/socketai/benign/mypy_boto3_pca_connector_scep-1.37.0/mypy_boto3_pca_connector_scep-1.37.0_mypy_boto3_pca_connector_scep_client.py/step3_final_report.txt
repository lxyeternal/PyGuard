{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS pca-connector-scep client, serving as a static SDK stub with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "Class and method signatures, type definitions, import statements, and property declarations; no dynamic input or external data handling.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; purely static type annotations and interface definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year '2025' is in the future relative to current dates, which may be a placeholder or typo but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK interface with no dynamic code, network activity, or secrets. It contains only type annotations and method signatures for AWS service interaction. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The absence of code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors confirms its benign nature. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a placeholder.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured, static interface for AWS SDK interactions, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk, reflecting its benign, stub-like nature.",
