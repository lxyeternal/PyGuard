  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the pca-connector-scep AWS service client, providing a structured and typed wrapper around boto3 functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries, botocore exceptions, and local type definition modules; method parameters and properties.",
  "sinks": "Method calls that invoke AWS APIs, especially those accepting user-defined parameters such as Params, kwargs, or operation_name.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into AWS API calls via method arguments and are used to generate presigned URLs or perform resource actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious string manipulations observed; usage of typing and overloads is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily composed of class definitions, method signatures, and type annotations for a boto3 client wrapper. It imports necessary modules and defines a structured interface. There are no data leaks, malicious network calls, or code that manipulates data in an insecure manner. The functions correspond to AWS API calls and follow standard patterns. The use of type annotations, overloads, and exception classes is typical for stubs. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and interface definitions for a boto3 AWS service client. It contains no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is purely for type hinting and API interfacing, with no suspicious logic or network activity.",
