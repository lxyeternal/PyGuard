  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for interacting with AWS pca-connector-scep service via boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports, class definitions, method definitions, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "Method calls, property accesses, and data flow within class methods and properties.",
  "flows": "Method calls with parameters unpacked from request type definitions, returning responses; property access for exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard AWS SDK patterns. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation. No data exfiltration code, network calls, or system modifications evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard boto3 client wrapper with type annotations for the AWS pca-connector-scep service. It defines a client class with methods corresponding to API operations, including exception handling and paginator methods. The import statements are typical for type hints and AWS SDK usage. No signs of malicious behavior such as data theft, backdoors, or network communications. The code appears to be auto-generated or structured for type safety and documentation, without any suspicious logic or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured type annotation and client interface for AWS SDK, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It primarily provides type hints and method signatures for interacting with AWS services securely.",
