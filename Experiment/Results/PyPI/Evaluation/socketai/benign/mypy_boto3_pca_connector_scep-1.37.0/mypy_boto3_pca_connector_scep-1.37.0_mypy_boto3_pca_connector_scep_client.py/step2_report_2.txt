  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a type stub and interface for the AWS pca-connector-scep client, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis. The confidence is high (0.95). The mention of a 2025 copyright date as suspicious is noted but deemed likely a placeholder.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it confirms the code is a standard, type-annotated AWS SDK interface with no malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, consistent with the analysis. Confidence is high (0.95).\n- **Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Also confirms the code is a benign, auto-generated interface with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, matching the findings. Confidence is perfect (1.0).\n- **Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that the code is a standard boto3 client stub with no suspicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, consistent with the analysis. Confidence is 1.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: a type-annotated, safe interface for AWS SDK, with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, aligned with the analysis. Confidence is 1.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a benign, auto-generated, type stub interface for AWS SDK.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior is detected.\n- The only minor point is the 2025 copyright date, which is suspicious but likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware scores:** All should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All should be 0, as the code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the above, all should be at or near 0, reflecting minimal or no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe, auto-generated AWS SDK interface with no signs of malicious or obfuscated content.",
