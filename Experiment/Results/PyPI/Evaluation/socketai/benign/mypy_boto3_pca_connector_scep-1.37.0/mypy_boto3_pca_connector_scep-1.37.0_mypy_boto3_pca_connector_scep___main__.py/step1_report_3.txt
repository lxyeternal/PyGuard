  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for displaying information.",
  "flows": "User input (--version) triggers print_version, otherwise print_info outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The copyright date is 2025, which is inconsistent with the data cutoff, but this is likely a benign typo or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward CLI script with functions to display package information and version. It reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and writes to stdout using sys.stdout.write. There are no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No unusual or obfuscated constructs. The code's logic is simple and clear, focusing solely on printing static info. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility for displaying package information. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident based on this code snippet.",
