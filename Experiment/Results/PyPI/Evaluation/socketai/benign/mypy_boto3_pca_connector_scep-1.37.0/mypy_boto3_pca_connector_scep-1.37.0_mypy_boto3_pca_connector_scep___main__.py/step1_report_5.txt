  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Writes output to standard output (sys.stdout.write).",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' in sys.argv, then calls print_version() which writes to stdout; otherwise calls print_info() which writes package info to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No network activity, file operations, or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The script serves as a simple CLI interface, responding to a '--version' argument by printing version info, otherwise displaying package info. It uses standard input/output operations and does not handle untrusted data sources. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code appears straightforward and well-structured, focused solely on displaying static information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only prints predefined information based on command-line arguments.",
