  "purpose": "The script functions as a CLI entry point that provides package information and version details when executed.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; outputs information to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout; no other external or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "User supplies command-line arguments -> the script checks for '--version' -> outputs version info or package info -> script terminates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward, mainly printing static information.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to handle command-line arguments and output. It defines two functions for printing static package info and version. The main() function checks if '--version' is in sys.argv; if so, it prints the version; otherwise, it prints package info. The script executes main() if run directly. All output is static and informational. No untrusted data handling or external network activity is present. No obfuscated or malicious code detected. The purpose is purely informational; there are no signs of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package details and version information. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks.",
