  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI entry point to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; writes output to stdout via sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout; no untrusted data sources or external communications present.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, it calls print_version() and outputs version info; otherwise, it calls print_info() to output package details.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward CLI operations: reading command-line arguments, printing static information, and terminating. There are no external data sources, no network communication, or dynamic code execution. The code structure and content are simple, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package information and version details. It does not contain malware or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and safe.",
