  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI utility that displays static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n- It imports only `sys`, defines functions to print static info, and checks for `--version` argument.\n- No external data sources, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns.\n- The copyright year (2025) is inconsistent with the data cutoff (2023), but this is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?** No. The code performs simple, safe I/O operations with no vulnerabilities.\n- **Malicious behavior?** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation?** No, the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risks?** None detected.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\nAll five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. They correctly identify the purpose and flow, with no anomalies or security concerns.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n\n**Confidence levels:** All are 1, reflecting high certainty.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is very simple, static, and safe.\n- The only unusual aspect is the copyright year 2025, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not an indicator of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the code and reports, I would assign the following scores:\n\n| Aspect            | Score | Justification |\n|-------------------|---------|----------------|\n| Malware           | 0       | No malicious activity or code present. |\n| Obfuscated        | 0       | Clear, straightforward code. |\n| Security Risk     | 0       | No vulnerabilities or risky behavior. |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign.**\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are accurate; no changes needed.\n- The high confidence scores are justified.\n- The code does not warrant any escalation in risk scores.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n- Confirm the code is safe and benign.\n\n**This analysis aligns with the consensus in the reports.**",
