  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility.\n- It imports `sys` and defines two functions:\n  - `print_info()` outputs static package info.\n  - `print_version()` outputs the version number.\n- The `main()` function checks if `--version` is in `sys.argv`; if so, it calls `print_version()`, otherwise it calls `print_info()`.\n- The script executes `main()` if run directly.\n\n**Review of the reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is straightforward, static, and benign.\n- No suspicious behavior, external data handling, or obfuscation is detected.\n- The reports note the copyright year as 2025, which is inconsistent with the data cutoff (October 2023), but this is likely a benign typo or placeholder.\n- No hardcoded secrets, malicious patterns, or malware indicators are present.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network calls, or execute dynamic code.\n\n**Security implications:**\n- The code is purely informational and has no apparent security risks.\n- The `malware` score is 0 across all reports, which is consistent.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The `securityRisk` score is 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or points of concern:**\n- The only minor anomaly is the copyright year 2025, which might be a typo or placeholder, but it does not impact security.\n- No evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- `malware`: 0 (correct)\n- `obfuscated`: 0 (correct)\n- `securityRisk`: 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n- The code is a simple, safe CLI utility.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The code is straightforward, with no security concerns. The reports are thorough and align with my assessment.",
