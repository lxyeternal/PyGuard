{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI entry point for a package, providing version and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and outputs information to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout; no untrusted data is processed or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument (e.g., '--version') triggers output functions; otherwise, info is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and defines functions to print package info and version. It checks for '--version' argument to display version; otherwise, it displays package info. The code performs simple input/output operations with no data manipulation or external calls. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility for displaying package info and version. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
