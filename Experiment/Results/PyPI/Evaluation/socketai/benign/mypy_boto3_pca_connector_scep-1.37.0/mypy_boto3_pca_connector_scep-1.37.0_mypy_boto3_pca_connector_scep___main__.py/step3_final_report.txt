{
  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version number based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv; writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Checks sys.argv for '--version' and calls print_version() or print_info() accordingly; outputs static strings.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a copyright date of 2025, which is inconsistent with the data cutoff but likely a placeholder or typo; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static CLI utility with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or data processing. It only reads command-line arguments and outputs predefined static information. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. The code's behavior is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious CLI utility that displays static package info. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
