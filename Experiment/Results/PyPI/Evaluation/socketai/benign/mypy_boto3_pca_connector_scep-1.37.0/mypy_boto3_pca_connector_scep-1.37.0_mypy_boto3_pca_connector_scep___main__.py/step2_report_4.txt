  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code Confirmation:**\n- The code is a simple CLI utility that prints static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n- No dynamic code execution, no external data sources, no network activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscation.\n- The code appears straightforward and benign.\n\n**2. Logical, Reasoning, or Summary Flaws:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a benign CLI utility.\n- The only minor inconsistency is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to the data cutoff (October 2023). This is likely a typo or placeholder, not a security concern.\n- No flaws or mistakes in the reasoning or summaries.\n\n**3. Score Evaluation:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - Purpose: Correctly identified as a CLI info utility.\n  - Sources/Sinks: Properly identified as reading sys.argv and writing to stdout.\n  - Anomalies: None detected.\n  - Malware: 0 in all reports.\n  - Security risk: 0 in all reports.\n  - Confidence: 1, indicating high certainty.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, no obfuscation detected.\n\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n**4. Justification for Higher Risk/Malware Scores:**\n- Since the code is static, straightforward, and does not perform any suspicious actions, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- The risk score is also appropriately 0, given the benign nature.\n\n**5. Potential Assumptions and Claims:**\n- All reports correctly state that there are no suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that aren't present.\n- The only questionable point is the copyright year, but it doesn't impact security.\n\n**6. Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors are present.\n- The scores across all reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a simple CLI utility with static output.  \n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.  \n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed.",
