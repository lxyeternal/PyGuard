{
  "purpose": "Main interface module for pca-connector-scep service, providing access to client and paginator classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator) and the embedded documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up class references and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year is set to 2025, which is in the future relative to current real-world time (2024), potentially suspicious but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, class aliasing, and documentation. It does not execute any untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated code. The only unusual aspect is the future-dated copyright, which is likely an error or placeholder. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "This module serves as an interface layer exposing specific classes and documentation. It contains no malicious or suspicious code. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is unlikely to be malicious.",
