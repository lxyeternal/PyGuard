{
  "purpose": "Provides a static interface for the pca-connector-scep service, importing client and paginator classes and defining exports.",
  "sources": "Static imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), no external data or input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static import and export statements.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which appears to be a typo or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes, assigns a class to a variable, and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code, no user input handling, no network calls, and no obfuscated or malicious patterns. The only unusual aspect is the future year, which does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static SDK interface module with no malicious or security concerns. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or placeholder. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
