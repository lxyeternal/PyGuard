  "purpose": "Main interface module for pca-connector-scep service, providing imports and type aliases for client interaction.",
  "sources": "Code reads static module imports, package metadata, and inline documentation. No external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this module primarily defines imports and constants.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a copyright notice with an unusual future year (2025). No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscated content detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module defining imports, constants, and documentation for a service client. It includes an inline docstring with usage examples, static imports from local modules, and an explicit __all__ declaration. No user input handling, network activity, or executable code with security implications is present. The future copyright year appears to be a typo or placeholder but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured interface module with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as an organized entry point for client interactions with the pca-connector-scep service.",
