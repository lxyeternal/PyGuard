  "purpose": "This code provides the main interface and documentation for the pca-connector-scep service, including imports and class assignments for interacting with the service.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), and the docstring that contains usage instructions and licensing information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted input or data; the code primarily imports modules and defines exports.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes and functions, assigns a class to a variable, and exports them; no data flow from external sources or untrusted input is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors, are present. The docstring contains a standard usage example.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as an interface module, primarily importing classes and defining exports. It includes a descriptive docstring with usage instructions and licensing info. No external input handling, network communication, or sensitive data processing occurs. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard SDK or library interface setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign interface module for a specific AWS service client, with no malicious behaviors or security risks detected. It simply imports, assigns, and exports classes and functions for use elsewhere.",
