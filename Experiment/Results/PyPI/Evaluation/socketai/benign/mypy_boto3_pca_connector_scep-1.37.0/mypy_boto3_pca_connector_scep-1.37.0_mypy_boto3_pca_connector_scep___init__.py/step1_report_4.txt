  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the pca-connector-scep service, including documentation and client setup.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and defines the Client alias; no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up imports and client aliases without any data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; only standard import and alias definitions, no credentials, no obfuscation, no code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, client aliasing, and module exports. It includes a documentation comment and example usage. No external input, no data handling, no network calls, and no security-sensitive operations are present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. It appears to be a typical interface module for a SDK or API wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module that provides access to the pca-connector-scep service. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
