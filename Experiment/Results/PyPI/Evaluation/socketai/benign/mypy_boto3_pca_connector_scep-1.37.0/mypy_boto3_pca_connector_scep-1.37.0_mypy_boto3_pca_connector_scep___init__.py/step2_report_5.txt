  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their findings, scores, and any inconsistencies or issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward interface module, importing classes, assigning a variable, and exporting them. No suspicious activity, no external input handling, no obfuscation, no malware.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's simplicity. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a simple module with static imports and documentation. Notes the future copyright year (2025).\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The future year is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious. The report's conclusion is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—imports, class aliasing, documentation, no dynamic or malicious code.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, just imports and aliasing, with no external data or network activity. No malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n- **Assessment:** No concerns; code is a standard SDK interface.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with the only anomaly being the future copyright year (2025).\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The future date is suspicious but likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious. The overall code remains benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is a minimal interface module, with no dynamic or executable logic, no external input handling, and no network activity. No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Anomalies:** The only anomaly across reports is the future copyright year (2025). This is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Confidence Levels:** High, given the static and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n- **Additional Notes:** The only minor concern is the future year (2025), which should be corrected, but it doesn't impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the static analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nProceed with this assessment unless new information or dynamic analysis suggests otherwise.",
