{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface and documentation for the pca-connector-scep service, exposing client classes and paginators for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), reading module attributes and documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network calls, or user input processing observed.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and assigns class references; no data flow from sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present. Documentation string is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, a documentation comment, and an assignment of a class to a variable, which is typical for an SDK or interface module. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity is evident. The code appears to define an API client interface for a specific service without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK interface module with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It simply exposes classes and constants for external use.",
