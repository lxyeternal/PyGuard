  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward interface module, importing classes and defining exports. No untrusted input, network activity, or malicious code is present. The only oddity is the future copyright year (2025).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully benign. The future year is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it's a simple module with static imports, no dynamic code, no external input, or network calls. The future year (2025) is again noted but not suspicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—imports, class aliasing, documentation. No external input or network activity. No anomalies besides the future year.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Identical to previous reports, straightforward SDK interface code. No suspicious activity. The only minor anomaly is the future year (2025).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** No security issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, with the same structure and no malicious indicators. The future year (2025) is noted but not suspicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is a static interface module with no dynamic behavior, no untrusted data handling, and no network operations.\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign. The only minor point is the future copyright year, which is likely a placeholder or typo.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports assign zero to malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is appropriate given the static, non-malicious nature of the code.\n- **Malware and Obfuscation:** No malware or obfuscation detected; scores are consistent.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code does not process untrusted input or perform sensitive operations.\n- **Overall Confidence:** High, all reports agree on benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code appears to be a benign, well-structured SDK interface module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign an overall estimate based on all reports, I would agree with their assessments and assign scores as above. The only potential concern—though minor—is the future copyright year, which is unlikely to be malicious but might be corrected for accuracy.",
