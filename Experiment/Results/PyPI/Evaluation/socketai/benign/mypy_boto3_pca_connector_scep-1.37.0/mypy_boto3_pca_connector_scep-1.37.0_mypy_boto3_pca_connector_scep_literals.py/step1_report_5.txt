  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS resource and service identifiers used in type annotations.",
  "sources": "Module imports (`sys`, `typing`, `typing_extensions`), module docstring (documentation and copyright), literal type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code solely defines constants and types.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is a straightforward static type definitions module. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a descriptive docstring providing documentation and usage example, which is benign. Imports are standard for version compatibility. The bulk of the code consists of constant type definitions using `Literal` for AWS resource identifiers, which is typical for type hinting in SDKs. There are no runtime operations, user inputs, or external data handling. The code is purely declarative, providing type annotations for other modules to use. No suspicious or malicious activity is detectable. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is present. The code is clean, well-structured, and only for type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static type definition module for AWS resource and service string literals. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a safe utility module for type annotations.",
