  "purpose": "Define type literals for pca-connector-scep service in Python, mainly for type annotations and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Static string literals assigned to type alias variables, imported modules, and version check for typing import.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or output sinks present in the code.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow involving untrusted input or output; the code purely defines constants and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward and primarily static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' and conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version. It then defines multiple string literal types as type aliases for use in type annotations. The string literals are standard identifiers and documented in the module's docstring. There are no inputs, external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code's structure is simple and static, serving as a constants module. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module that defines type literal constants for type annotations, with no indication of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks.",
