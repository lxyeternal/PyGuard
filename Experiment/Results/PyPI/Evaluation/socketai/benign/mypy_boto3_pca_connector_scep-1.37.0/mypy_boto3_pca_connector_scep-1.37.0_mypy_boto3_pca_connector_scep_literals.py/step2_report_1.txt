  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, overestimations, or overlooked issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines string literal types for AWS resource identifiers, with no input/output or external communication. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign, static, and safe. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.\n- **Potential issues:** None. The code is straightforward.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the static nature and compatibility handling. No suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the code's purpose as static type annotations. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the code's role in type safety, with no data flow or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's static, declarative nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the code as a benign constants module, with no external or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly interprets the code's purpose.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the code as static type definitions for AWS identifiers, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's static, safe nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as a benign, static module defining string literals for type annotations. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in each report are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\nThe reports are thorough and accurate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a safe, well-structured static type definitions module with no security concerns. The scores and reasoning in all reports are justified and aligned with the code's characteristics.",
