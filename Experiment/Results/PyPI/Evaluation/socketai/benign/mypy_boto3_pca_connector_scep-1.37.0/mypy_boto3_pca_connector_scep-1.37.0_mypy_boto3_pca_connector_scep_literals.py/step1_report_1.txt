{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for use in type annotations related to the pca-connector-scep service and AWS resource identifiers.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and typing modules; string literals assigned to type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or external communication points present in this code.",
  "flows": "N/A – No data flow from sources to sinks since the code only defines constants and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code includes conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes type aliases for specific string literals used in type annotations, facilitating static type checking in Python projects. It imports standard modules, uses conditional imports for compatibility, and defines various string literal types for AWS service identifiers and resource names. No input/output operations, network calls, or executable code are present. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malware-related patterns. The code appears to be a straightforward, safe, and well-structured type definition module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module containing type annotations and string literals for AWS services. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious code, or security risks identified. It simply provides structured constants for use in type hints. Overall, it is safe and does not pose any security threats.",
