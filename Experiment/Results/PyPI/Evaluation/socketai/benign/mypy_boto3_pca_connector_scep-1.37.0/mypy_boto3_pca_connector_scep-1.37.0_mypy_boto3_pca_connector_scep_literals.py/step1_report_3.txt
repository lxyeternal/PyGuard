  "purpose": "Define type annotations for string literal types used in the pca-connector-scep service, aiding type safety and autocompletion.",
  "sources": "Imported sys module; conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; primarily static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; standard type annotations and conditional import based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains type alias definitions for string literals, with a version check for importing 'Literal'. No input handling, data processing, or external calls are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The structure is straightforward and purely declarative, serving as type hints for other modules.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign, static type definition module with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides string literal types for use in type annotations.",
