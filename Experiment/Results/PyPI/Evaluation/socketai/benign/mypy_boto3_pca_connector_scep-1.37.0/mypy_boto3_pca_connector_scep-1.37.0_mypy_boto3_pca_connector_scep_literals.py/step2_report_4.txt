  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is purely a set of type alias definitions for string literals, primarily for static type checking.\n- It includes conditional imports for compatibility with different Python versions.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The purpose is to facilitate type safety and autocompletion for AWS resource identifiers and service names.\n- The documentation and comments are standard and benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Benign static type definitions for AWS identifiers; no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. The report accurately describes the code as safe and benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; static type annotations, no dynamic behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; purely static type alias definitions.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Static type definitions, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as previous; no malicious activity, purely for type annotations.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a static, well-structured module for type annotations.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0) are appropriate and consistent across reports.\n\n---\n\n### **My final expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior or indicators.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, static, and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, benign, and serves a utility purpose for static type checking. All reports correctly assess the code's security posture.",
