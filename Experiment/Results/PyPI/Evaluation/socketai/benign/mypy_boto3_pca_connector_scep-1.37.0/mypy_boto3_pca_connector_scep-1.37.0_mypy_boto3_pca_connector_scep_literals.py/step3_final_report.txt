  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for AWS resource identifiers, service names, and other constants used for type annotations and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static string literals assigned to type aliases; no input, output, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static type alias definitions with conditional import for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module providing type annotations for AWS resource and service identifiers using Literal types. It includes conditional imports for Python version compatibility. There are no runtime operations, data handling, or external interactions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The purpose is purely for type safety and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type alias definitions for AWS identifiers, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals and scores are consistent with its static, safe nature.",
