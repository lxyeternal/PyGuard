  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, overestimations, or underestimations of risk, malware, obfuscation, and overall security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward static module defining string literal types for AWS resource identifiers and service names.\n- No input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- Conditional import for `Literal` is standard for compatibility.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior or malware patterns.\n- The purpose is primarily for type safety and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Defines string literal types for `pca-connector-scep` and AWS resource identifiers.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n**Conclusion:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining type annotations for string literals.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states that the code is purely for static type annotations, with no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n**Conclusion:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Similar static type definitions for AWS identifiers.\n- **Assessment:** Properly notes the code as static, benign, and free of malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n**Conclusion:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Defines string literal types for AWS resource identifiers.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly describes the code as static, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n**Conclusion:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous, for AWS resource string literals.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriately states the code is benign, static, and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n**Conclusion:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall analysis**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is purely static, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate as there are no security risks or vulnerabilities present.\n\n### **Final recommendations**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment**\n\nGiven the code's nature:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities or risks.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign static type definition module, safe for use in any project. No security concerns or malicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are accurate and appropriately conservative. No further action needed.",
