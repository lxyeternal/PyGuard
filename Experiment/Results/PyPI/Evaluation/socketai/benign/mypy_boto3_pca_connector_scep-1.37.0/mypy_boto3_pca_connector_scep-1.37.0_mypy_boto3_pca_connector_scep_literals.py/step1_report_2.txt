{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations for string literals used as identifiers in the pca-connector-scep service, primarily for input validation and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from static string literals assigned to type aliases, and conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted data, user input, or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations; the code solely defines constants and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code contains license and documentation comments, but no executable or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely for type annotation purposes, providing string literal types for various AWS resource and service identifiers. It includes a conditional import to maintain compatibility across Python versions. No dynamic execution, data processing, or untrusted data handling occurs. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, serving solely as a static type definitions module without any malicious intent or security concerns. It does not perform any data processing or network operations. The high-confidence assessment confirms the absence of malicious behavior.",
