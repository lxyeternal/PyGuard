  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-pca-connector-scep', used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static package metadata (name, version, author, etc.); importing setup from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that send data over network, write to system files, or execute commands.",
  "flows": "N/A - all data are static or file reads with no untrusted input flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard setup script with no unusual or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and setuptools, reads a markdown file for description, and calls setup() with static metadata. No user input, environment variables, or external data influence the behavior. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The script does not execute any commands or network operations. All parts serve legitimate package setup purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python module, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
