  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code and the provided assessments.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a standard Python package setup script.\n- It reads a static README.md file for the long description.\n- It specifies package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and URLs.\n- There are no dynamic inputs, user data, network operations, or code obfuscation.\n- No suspicious or malicious code structures are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code presence of setup configuration**: No issues detected.\n- **No untrusted input handling or data processing**: Correct.\n- **No obfuscated or malicious code**: Correct.\n- **No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns**: Correct.\n- **Dependency management appears standard**: Correct.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **None identified**. All reports correctly identify the script as benign and standard.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n\nThese are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n- Malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious code or behavior.\n- Obfuscated score of 0 is justified; code is straightforward.\n- Security risk of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors detected.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- None. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe setup script is a typical, benign package configuration file with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are correct, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Work-through Summary:**  \n- Confirmed no issues or anomalies.  \n- Scores are appropriate and justified.  \n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is straightforward.  \n- Overall, the package setup script is safe and standard.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
