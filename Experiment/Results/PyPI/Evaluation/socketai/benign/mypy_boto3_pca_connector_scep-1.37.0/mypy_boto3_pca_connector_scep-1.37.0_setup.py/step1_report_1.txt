{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-pca-connector-scep', used for package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and static package metadata defined within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted input handling or data processing that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "The static metadata and file reading flow into the setup() function to prepare package installation data; no dynamic or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code follows standard Python packaging conventions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Path' for reading the README.md file and uses setuptools for package setup. It defines static package metadata such as name, version, author, description, classifiers, and dependencies. The only file read is a static README file, which is common for package descriptions. There are no inputs from users or external sources that could be malicious. The dependencies are specified with a version constraint. The overall structure appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or include obfuscated or malicious code. Therefore, it can be considered safe.",
