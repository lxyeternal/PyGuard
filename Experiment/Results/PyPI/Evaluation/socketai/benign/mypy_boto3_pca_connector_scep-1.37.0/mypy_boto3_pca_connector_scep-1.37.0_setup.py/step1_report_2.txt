  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-pca-connector-scep', primarily for package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the current directory to load 'README.md' for long description; reads package data and dependencies for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no user input or external data sources are processed at runtime.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow paths present; the script configures package metadata without data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code present. Uses standard setup tools.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, loads a markdown file for description, and calls setup() with static package metadata and configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external data processing, or code injection. It follows typical packaging conventions without hidden or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and intended for package distribution.",
