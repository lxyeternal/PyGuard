  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the mypy-boto3-pca-connector-scep Python module.",
  "sources": "Static file read (README.md), fixed metadata, dependencies, and package data definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the script does not process untrusted input or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Reading static README.md -> calling setup() with fixed parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static configuration with no dynamic or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that reads a static README.md file and invokes setuptools.setup() with explicit, fixed metadata and dependencies. It contains no dynamic input, network activity, code execution, or obfuscation. All dependencies are explicitly declared, and no secrets or untrusted data are handled. The script's structure and content follow common packaging practices, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup configuration with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate a safe and well-formed packaging script.",
