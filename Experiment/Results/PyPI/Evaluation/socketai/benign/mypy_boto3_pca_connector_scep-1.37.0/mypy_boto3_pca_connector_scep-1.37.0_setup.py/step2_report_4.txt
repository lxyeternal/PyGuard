  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the script as a standard Python package setup configuration.\n- No dynamic or untrusted input handling is involved.\n- The code reads only a static README.md file and defines static metadata.\n- No network activity, code execution, or obfuscation is present.\n- The package data and dependencies are explicitly specified.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n\n- **Presence of code:** The code is straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious elements.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Security risks:** None identified.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the script only reads static files and calls a well-known setup function.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the script as benign.\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for Risk Score > 0.5:\n\n- Since all evidence points to a standard, safe setup script, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n- The reports correctly reflect this with a score of 0.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- The only file read is a static README.md, which is common and safe.\n- No external inputs or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- No signs of malicious intent or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\nThe package setup script is entirely benign, following standard practices, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a typical, safe setup configuration with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
