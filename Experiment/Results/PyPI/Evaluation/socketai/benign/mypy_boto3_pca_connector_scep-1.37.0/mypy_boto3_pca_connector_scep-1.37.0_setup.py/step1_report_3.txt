  "purpose": "The script sets up and installs the 'mypy-boto3-pca-connector-scep' package with its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for the long description; reads input from setup parameters and environment variables for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "Uses setuptools.setup() to define package installation; no untrusted data sinks or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "Reads package description from a file, then passes static configuration data to setup(), with no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no network activity, and no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script. It reads a markdown file for the description and supplies static metadata to setuptools. There are no dynamic or untrusted data sources, nor any suspicious or malicious code patterns. All dependencies are declared explicitly, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup script for a Python package with no indicators of malicious activity or security risks.",
