{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and paginator classes for the pca-connector-scep service client.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; uses sys.version_info for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; code mainly defines classes and type annotations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code establishes class structures for pagination with type safety.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation observed. Use of sys.version_info for conditional import is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured type annotations for boto3 paginator classes specific to the pca-connector-scep service. It imports necessary modules, defines type-specific base classes with conditional imports for compatibility, and declares paginator classes with type-annotated paginate methods. No data input/output operations, external data handling, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be straightforward, well-documented, and solely focused on type definitions and class structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured type annotation module for boto3 paginators. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves purely as a typing aid with no malicious intent.",
