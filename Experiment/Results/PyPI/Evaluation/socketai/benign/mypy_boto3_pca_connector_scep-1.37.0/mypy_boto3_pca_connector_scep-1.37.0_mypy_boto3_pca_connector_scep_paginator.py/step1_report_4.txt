  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginator classes for the pca-connector-scep service client, facilitating paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; class methods accessing API pagination features.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted input handling or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "The code defines classes and methods for paginating API responses, primarily involving type annotations and class inheritance without data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed. Usage of version-specific imports and type hints aligns with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The script provides type annotations and subclasses for AWS paginator objects, ensuring type safety and clarity. It conditionally imports 'Unpack' based on Python version, which is standard. The classes extend base Paginator classes with appropriate generic types, and the paginate methods are defined with correct type annotations. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears purely for type safety and code clarity, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured module for type annotations and paginator class definitions for the boto3 'pca-connector-scep' client. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code is safe and intended for enhancing developer experience with type safety and documentation support.",
