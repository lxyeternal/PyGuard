  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for the pca-connector-scep service client, facilitating pagination in boto3 interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; class method parameters using Unpack with type definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or output mechanisms observed.",
  "flows": "Paginator classes extend base classes; paginate methods accept kwargs unpacked from specific type definitions and return PageIterator objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code structure is straightforward and documentation links are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines paginator classes with type annotations for a boto3 client. It conditionally imports Unpack for Python >= 3.12, and sets up type hints for paginator classes. No user input, external data sources, or untrusted data flows are present. No malicious or malicious-looking code, backdoors, or obfuscated segments are detected. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured type annotation and class definition module for AWS SDK pagination.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for type annotations and paginator class definitions with no malicious or suspicious elements. It adheres to standard patterns for boto3 stubs and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
