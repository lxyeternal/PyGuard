{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and paginator classes for the 'pca-connector-scep' service client in boto3, providing typed interfaces for paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; reading configuration and type info for paginator classes.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data processing or external data outputs, nor untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A – primarily class definitions and type annotations; no runtime data flows or input/output handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. The code is standard for typed boto3 paginator definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of class definitions for paginators with type annotations, docstrings referencing external documentation, and conditional imports for type checking. There are no data inputs, no processing of untrusted data, and no external network operations or file manipulations. The code appears to be a typical, well-structured type definition module for boto3 paginators. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage, nor obfuscation, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard type annotation and class definition module for boto3 paginators. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, poses no security risks, and is unlikely to be used for malicious purposes.",
