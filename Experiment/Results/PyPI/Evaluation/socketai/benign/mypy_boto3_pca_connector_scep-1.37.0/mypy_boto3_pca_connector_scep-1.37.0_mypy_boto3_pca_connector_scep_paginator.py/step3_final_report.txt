  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the boto3 'pca-connector-scep' service client, aiding in type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads type definitions, system version info for conditional imports, and class inheritance structures.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs, outputs, or external data flows; the code does not process external data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves class inheritance and method signatures for pagination, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured module providing type annotations for boto3 paginators. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, defines classes with documented methods, and contains no runtime data processing or external interactions. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and serves solely as a type stub for AWS SDK pagination classes. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and no adjustments to the scores are necessary.",
