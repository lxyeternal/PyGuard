{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations and paginator classes for the 'pca-connector-scep' service client in boto3, facilitating paginated API responses with type safety.",
  "sources": "The code reads type definitions from imported modules and system information for Python version; no external input or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only sets up class inheritance and type annotations without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code appears to be standard type stub definitions and class extensions for boto3 paginators.",
  "analysis": "The script imports type annotations and conditional typing extensions, defines paginator classes with associated paginate methods, and includes docstrings linking to documentation. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data processing that could indicate malicious intent. The code's structure and comments are consistent with legitimate SDK stub definitions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type annotations and paginator class definitions for boto3, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as type-safe wrappers for paginated AWS API calls.",
