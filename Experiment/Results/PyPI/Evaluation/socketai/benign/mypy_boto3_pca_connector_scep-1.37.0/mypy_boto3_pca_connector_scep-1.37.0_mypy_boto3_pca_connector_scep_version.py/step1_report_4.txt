  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The string assignment '__version__ = \"1.37.0\"'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code simply assigns a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded version number is typical for such files; no suspicious code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a comment, a copyright notice, and a variable assignment for the package version. There are no input sources, no external data handling, no dynamic code, or suspicious behaviors. The version string appears static and hardcoded, which is common for __version__ variables.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a metadata placeholder and contains no potentially harmful logic.",
