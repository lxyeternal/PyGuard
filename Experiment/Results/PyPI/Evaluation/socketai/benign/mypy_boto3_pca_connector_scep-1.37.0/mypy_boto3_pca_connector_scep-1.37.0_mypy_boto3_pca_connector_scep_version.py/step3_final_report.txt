  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a static string for version control and metadata.",
  "sources": "No external sources; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple, straightforward version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to __version__, with a copyright comment. It contains no input handling, network activity, dynamic code, or obfuscation. The code is standard for Python package versioning and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores are appropriate and justified, indicating no security concern.",
