  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a static version string (`__version__ = \"1.37.0\"`) with a copyright comment.\n   - No input handling, data processing, network interactions, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a simple version declaration with no security concerns.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (high confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are zero for malware and security risk, and the code is non-malicious, this is justified.\n   - The code is standard for version declaration and poses no security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - The malware score is zero across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - No malicious behavior or intent is evident.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on code analysis.\n   - No unwarranted security concerns are raised.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Additional Recommendations:\n\n- Given the simplicity of the code, the overall security risk is negligible.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, straightforward version declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
