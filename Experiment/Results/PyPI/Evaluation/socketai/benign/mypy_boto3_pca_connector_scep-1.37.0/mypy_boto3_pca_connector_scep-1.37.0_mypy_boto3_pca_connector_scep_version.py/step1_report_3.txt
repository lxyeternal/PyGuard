  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or potential leaks identified.",
  "flows": "The version string is assigned to __version__, with no further data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The comment about the source of truth appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code solely sets a version string variable with a static value. It includes a copyright notice but no input handling, data processing, or network interactions. There are no signs of malicious code or obfuscation. The structure is straightforward and typical for version declaration modules.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple version assignment with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a standard practice for package versioning.",
