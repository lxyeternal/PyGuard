  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - No dynamic behavior, input handling, or external interactions are present.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code appears standard and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated: 0`\n     - `malware: 0`\n     - `securityRisk: 0`\n     - `confidence: 1`\n   - These are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary unless future context suggests otherwise.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, and the code is a straightforward version declaration, no justification for higher scores is needed.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code contains only a static version string.\n   - No malicious behavior or intent is evident.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No unwarranted security concerns are raised.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, non-malicious version declaration.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical version string assignment with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of this code.",
