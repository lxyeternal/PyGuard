  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`, with no input handling, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code is standard for Python packages to declare version info.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The reasoning is sound: simple static assignment, no dynamic behavior, no security concerns.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - The confidence level is 1, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports conclude zero risk, malware, and obfuscation, there is no justification for higher scores.\n   - The code is trivial and standard, with no malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign malware = 0, which is correct.\n   - No malicious activity is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation.**  \n**The scores are appropriate and justified.**  \n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, and the report scores are accurate. No changes are necessary.",
