  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, reads a markdown file for the package description, and invokes setup() with package metadata. There are no sources of untrusted input, no data flows that lead to insecure operations, and no anomalous or suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be a typical Python package setup script without any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
