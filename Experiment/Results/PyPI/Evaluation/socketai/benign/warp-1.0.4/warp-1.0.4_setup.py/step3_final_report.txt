  "purpose": "To package a Python project named 'warp' with static metadata and description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description",
  "sinks": "Passing metadata to setuptools.setup()",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> Pass content to setup() parameters",
  "anomalies": "None; static file read, no dynamic code or external data",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script that reads a local README.md file and supplies static package metadata to setuptools.setup(). It involves no untrusted input, no code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The script follows typical packaging conventions and does not contain any suspicious patterns or malicious code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify it as benign, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
