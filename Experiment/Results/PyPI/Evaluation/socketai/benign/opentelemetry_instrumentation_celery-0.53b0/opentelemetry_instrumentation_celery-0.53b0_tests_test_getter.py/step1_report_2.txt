  "sources": "Input data from the 'carrier' dictionary and mock objects",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is written or transmitted; no data sinks present",
  "flows": "getter.get reads from mock objects or dictionaries, but only within controlled test scope",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is standard unit test code with mock objects and straightforward method calls",
  "analysis": "The code implements unit tests for the CeleryGetter class, using mocks and simple data structures. No user input, environment variables, or network communication is involved. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious logic is present. The code strictly tests getter methods, with no side effects or external dependencies that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward unit test code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
