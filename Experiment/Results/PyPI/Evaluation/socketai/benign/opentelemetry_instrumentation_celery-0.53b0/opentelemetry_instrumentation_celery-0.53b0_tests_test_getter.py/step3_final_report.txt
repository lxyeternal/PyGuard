  "purpose": "Unit tests for the CeleryGetter class from opentelemetry.instrumentation.celery, verifying get() and keys() methods behavior.",
  "sources": "Mock objects and in-memory dictionaries used as input data for getter.get() and getter.keys() methods.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communication, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from mock objects or dictionaries into getter.get(), with no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward unit testing code that uses mocks and simple data structures to verify class behavior. No external interactions, data leaks, or malicious patterns are present. The tests are standard and do not involve any risky operations. All reports agree on the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, representing standard unit tests with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments are consistent and justified.",
