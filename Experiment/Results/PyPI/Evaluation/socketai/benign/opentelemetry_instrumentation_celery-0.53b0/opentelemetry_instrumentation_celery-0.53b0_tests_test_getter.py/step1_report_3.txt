  "purpose": "Unit tests for the CeleryGetter class in the OpenTelemetry instrumentation for Celery.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from mocked objects and dictionaries, specifically in getter.get() method calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks, system modifications, or external communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from mocked objects or dictionaries into the getter methods, with no external or untrusted input sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code strictly performs unit testing operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests using unittest and mock libraries to verify the behavior of the CeleryGetter class. It tests the get() method with various input types and the keys() method. There are no indications of data leaks, external communications, or malicious behavior. The code appears standard, and its structure is typical for unit testing. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of unit tests for a specific class with no malicious intent, no data leaks, and no security risks. It does not interact with external systems or handle untrusted input in a harmful way.",
