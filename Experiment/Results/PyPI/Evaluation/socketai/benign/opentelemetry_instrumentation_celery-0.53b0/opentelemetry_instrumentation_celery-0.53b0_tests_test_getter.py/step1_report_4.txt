  "purpose": "Unit tests for the CeleryGetter class in the OpenTelemetry instrumentation package.",
  "sources": "Input data from mock objects and empty dictionary for testing getter methods.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent to external sources or sinks; tests only manipulate in-memory objects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; tests simply verify method outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard testing libraries and a specific class from OpenTelemetry. It defines a test case class with multiple test methods that create mock objects and verify the behavior of the CeleryGetter's get and keys methods. All data is derived from in-memory mocks or empty dicts, with no external network activity, credential handling, or data leaks involved. The code strictly tests functionality in a controlled environment without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of unit tests for a getter class, with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks detected.",
