  "purpose": "Unit tests for the CeleryGetter class in the OpenTelemetry instrumentation package.",
  "sources": "Reads from mock objects and a dictionary, specifically accessing the 'test' attribute or key.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input (mock object or dict) -> getter.get() -> return value, or getter.keys() -> keys list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of unit tests that instantiate a CeleryGetter object and test its get and keys methods using mock objects and dictionaries. The data flows are straightforward attribute or key access with no untrusted data handling or external data influence. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident; the code is standard testing code with no external data inputs or outputs that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for testing the behavior of the CeleryGetter class and contains no malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
