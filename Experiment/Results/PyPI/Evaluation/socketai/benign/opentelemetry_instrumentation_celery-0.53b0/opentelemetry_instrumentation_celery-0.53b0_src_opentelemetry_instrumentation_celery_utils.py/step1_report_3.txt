  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for integrating OpenTelemetry tracing with Celery tasks, including context propagation, attribute setting, and task retrieval.",
  "sources": "Reads data from Celery task objects, context dictionaries, signal keyword arguments, headers, and request objects.",
  "sinks": "Sets span attributes, updates context dictionaries, and retrieves task or message identifiers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from task or signal arguments to span attributes and context storage, enabling tracing across Celery task execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. The code mainly deals with context management and attribute setting, with no obvious malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, focusing on tracing context propagation and attribute extraction. It uses standard patterns for context management, logging, and Celery integration. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious commands are present. The functions perform safe attribute handling, with checks for None or empty values. The use of Celery and OpenTelemetry APIs appears legitimate. No obfuscation, code injection, or unsafe practices are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for Celery and OpenTelemetry integration, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or expose vulnerabilities. Overall, it is a benign, well-structured support library for tracing tasks.",
