  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a simple tuple assignment, setting `_instruments` to a string specifying a version range for the `celery` package.\n   - There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, and no signs of malicious behavior.\n   - The code is standard for dependency specification, typical in setup or configuration files.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign and straightforward.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are present in the code snippet itself.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, reflecting high certainty based on the code's simplicity.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent; they recognize this as a dependency declaration.\n   - No unwarranted suspicion is assigned; the reasoning is sound.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward dependency declaration with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No further action or concern is warranted.",
