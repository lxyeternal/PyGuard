  "purpose": "Declare a tuple containing a dependency requirement for the 'celery' package with specific version constraints.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the tuple to the variable '_instruments'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leak points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines a static tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a version constraint tuple for a package dependency and assigns it to a variable. There are no inputs, data processing, network activity, or dynamic behaviors. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The license comments are standard and do not affect security. The code appears to be a benign configuration fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
