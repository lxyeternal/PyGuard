  "purpose": "Dependency declaration specifying acceptable versions of the 'celery' package for the project.",
  "sources": "The tuple assignment '_instruments' which contains the version requirement string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code is static and only defines a dependency constraint.",
  "flows": "The code simply assigns a string to a variable; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static tuple assignment defining a version constraint for 'celery'. It contains no dynamic behavior, input/output, or external interactions. The license header is standard and unrelated to security concerns. All reports correctly identify it as a benign dependency specification with no malicious intent. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0, with confidence level 1, reflecting high certainty. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code poses no security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard dependency declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics. No further action is necessary.",
