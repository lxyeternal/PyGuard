  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports describe the code as a simple tuple assignment containing a version requirement string for the 'celery' package.\n   - The code is standard for dependency specification, with no dynamic behavior, input/output operations, or external interactions.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior**:\n   - The code does not contain any signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated payloads.\n   - The license header is standard and unrelated to security concerns.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, no obfuscation detected.\n   - **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, no malicious activity or payloads.\n   - **Risk Score (0)**: Appropriate, as dependency declarations alone do not constitute a security risk unless combined with other factors.\n\n4. **Any Claims Based on Assumptions?**:\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they identify the code as benign dependency specification.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation**:\n   - The code is a benign, standard dependency declaration.\n   - No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThere is no indication of malicious intent or security risk in this code snippet. The dependency specification is standard and safe.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a straightforward dependency declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
