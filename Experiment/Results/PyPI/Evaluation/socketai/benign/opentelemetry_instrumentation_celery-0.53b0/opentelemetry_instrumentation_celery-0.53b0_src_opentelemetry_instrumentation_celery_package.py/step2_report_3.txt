  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a tuple containing a version requirement string for the 'celery' package.\n   - The code is static, contains no input/output, no dynamic or obfuscated code, and no external interactions.\n   - The license header is standard and unrelated to malicious activity.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscation are present.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, such as code injection, hardcoded secrets, or network activity.\n   - The code serves as a dependency specification, typical in setup or configuration files.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is reasonable given the straightforwardness of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly dismiss any suspicion of malicious intent based on the code's simplicity.\n   - No reports make unsupported claims about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n   - The dependency specification is standard practice and does not introduce security risks by itself.\n\n5. **Critical Evaluation:**\n   - Since the code is just a tuple assignment with a version constraint, there is no basis for higher malware or obfuscation scores.\n   - The consistent scoring across reports is appropriate.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a benign dependency declaration, typical in open-source projects, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
