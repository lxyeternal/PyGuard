  "purpose": "Define a tuple of instrument dependencies for OpenTelemetry instrumentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data or interact with external systems in a way that could cause leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply assigns a tuple to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies present; the code is straightforward and contains only a tuple assignment with version constraints.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a license header followed by a tuple assignment to '_instruments'. There is no input processing, no data manipulation, and no network or file operations. The version string indicates dependency requirements. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard dependency declaration with no malicious or security risks detected. It appears to be a benign part of a larger codebase.",
