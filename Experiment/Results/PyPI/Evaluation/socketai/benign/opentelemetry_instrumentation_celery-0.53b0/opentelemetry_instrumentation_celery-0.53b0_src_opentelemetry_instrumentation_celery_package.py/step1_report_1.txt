{
  "purpose": "Define a tuple containing a version requirement for the 'celery' package, likely used for dependency management or version checks.",
  "sources": "None (no input reading, no data fetching or external data sources).",
  "sinks": "None (no data or untrusted input processing, no potential data leaks or effects).",
  "flows": "Not applicable (no data flow).",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple tuple assignment with a version specification string; no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a variable '_instruments' to a tuple containing a single string that specifies a version range for the 'celery' package. This is typical for dependency specifications in setup files or configuration scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no input/output handling, and no suspicious code patterns. The license header is standard and unrelated to malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign dependency specification used in a Python project, with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
