  "purpose": "Define a tuple of instrument dependencies for OpenTelemetry instrumentation",
  "sources": "The code assigns a string tuple to the variable _instruments",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "Assignment of a static string tuple; no flow of untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward assignment with no unusual language features or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static declaration of a tuple containing a dependency specification string. There are no external input sources, no data flows, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The content appears to be standard licensing and dependency declaration typical in open-source projects. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a dependency declaration with no security risks or malicious intent.",
