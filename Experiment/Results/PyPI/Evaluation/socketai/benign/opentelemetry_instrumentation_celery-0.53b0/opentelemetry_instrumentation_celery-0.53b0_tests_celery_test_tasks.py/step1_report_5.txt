{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Celery task queue with some basic task functions and integrates OpenTelemetry baggage collection.",
  "sources": "Imports from opentelemetry, Celery configuration, and task functions that accept parameters or return baggage data.",
  "sinks": "Return statements in task functions, particularly returning baggage data.",
  "flows": "Tasks accept input parameters (none directly shown as malicious), retrieve baggage data, or raise exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses OpenTelemetry baggage collection, which could potentially expose collected baggage data if misused, but in this context it appears benign. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed. The baggage retrieval is used solely for returning baggage info.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and establishes a Celery app with in-memory broker. It defines a custom exception and three tasks: one adds two numbers, another raises an exception, and the last returns all baggage data. The baggage data retrieval appears straightforward and does not involve any suspicious data handling or external network activity. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns are detected. The baggage collection is used for telemetry purposes, aligning with normal OpenTelemetry usage.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign setup for Celery tasks with OpenTelemetry baggage integration. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The tasks are simple, and the baggage retrieval is safe and common in telemetry contexts.",
