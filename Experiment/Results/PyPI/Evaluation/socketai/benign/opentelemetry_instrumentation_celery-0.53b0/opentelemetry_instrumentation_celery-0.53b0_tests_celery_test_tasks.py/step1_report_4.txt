{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Celery task queue with basic tasks and integrates OpenTelemetry baggage collection.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to task_add (num_a, num_b), and the baggage.get_all() call in task_returns_baggage.",
  "sinks": "baggage.get_all() potentially exposes collected baggage data; tasks could receive or process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to task_add flow directly into addition; baggage.get_all() outputs baggage data potentially collected from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of baggage.get_all() to return baggage data; no other suspicious or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Celery app with in-memory broker and simple tasks for addition, exception raising, and baggage retrieval. The baggage module from OpenTelemetry is used to gather and return baggage context, which could include tracing or contextual data. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The baggage retrieval is standard for telemetry purposes and does not introduce security issues by itself. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard telemetry setup with task definitions and baggage handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of baggage data could expose sensitive context if misused, but in this code, it simply returns the collected baggage. Overall, the code is benign.",
