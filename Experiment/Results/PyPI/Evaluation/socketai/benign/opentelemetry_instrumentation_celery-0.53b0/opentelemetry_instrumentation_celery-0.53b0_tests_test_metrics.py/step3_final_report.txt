  "purpose": "Unit testing suite for Celery task metrics instrumentation using OpenTelemetry, verifying correct metric collection and uninstrumented state.",
  "sources": "Reads task results via task_add.delay(), measures time, and collects metrics internally.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows; metrics are used internally for assertions.",
  "flows": "Task result retrieval flows into metric collection and validation functions; no external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Celery worker in a thread, instruments metrics collection, executes a task, and verifies the collected metrics through assertions. It uses standard libraries and testing patterns without any network activity, external data exfiltration, or obfuscation. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's purpose is purely instrumentation testing, with no suspicious flows or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign test suite for Celery metrics instrumentation with no malicious intent or security risks. The observed patterns are consistent with typical testing code, and no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior are present.",
