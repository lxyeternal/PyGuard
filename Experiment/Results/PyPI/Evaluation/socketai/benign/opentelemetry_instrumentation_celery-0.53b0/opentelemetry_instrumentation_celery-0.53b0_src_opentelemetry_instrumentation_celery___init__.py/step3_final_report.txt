  "purpose": "Instrumentation of Celery for tracing and metrics collection using OpenTelemetry, including span creation, context propagation, and signal handling.",
  "sources": "Celery task signals, request objects, headers, and task/request attributes.",
  "sinks": "Span creation, attribute setting, context injection/extraction, logging, and metrics recording.",
  "flows": "Context is extracted from task requests, spans are created and activated, context is injected into headers, and spans are finished upon task completion or failure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard OpenTelemetry practices for instrumenting Celery tasks, signals, and context management. It reads task info and headers, creates and finishes spans, injects/extracts context, and records metrics. No evidence of malicious activity, secrets, or backdoors. The code structure is clear, well-organized, and follows best practices for observability instrumentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, benign instrumentation for Celery using OpenTelemetry. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low at 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern due to its instrumentation purpose.",
