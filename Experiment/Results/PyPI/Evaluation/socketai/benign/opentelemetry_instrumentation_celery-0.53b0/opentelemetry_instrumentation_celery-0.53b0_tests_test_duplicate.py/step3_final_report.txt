{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test for the OpenTelemetry Celery instrumentation, verifying internal state after instrumentation and uninstrumentation calls.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only creates instances and calls methods on them.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows leading to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves instantiating objects, calling instrument and uninstrument methods, and asserting internal attributes; no external data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test with no external data handling, network activity, or malicious behavior. It verifies internal state of the instrumentation class after method calls. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent are detected. The code is standard testing code for a telemetry library, with no security risks or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard testing code with no malicious behavior or security issues. The scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores all at 0. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
