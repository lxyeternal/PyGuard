  "purpose": "Unit tests for OpenTelemetry instrumentation utilities in Celery context, verifying attribute setting, context propagation, and task ID retrieval.",
  "sources": "Reading from predefined context dictionaries, mock span objects, and Celery task functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; no data leak or unsafe operations detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from context input into span attribute setting functions, and from context into task ID retrieval functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. Code is standard testing code for instrumentation, with no obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed entirely of unit tests, mocking and verifying behavior of OpenTelemetry utilities within Celery tasks. It uses mock objects and static data without external inputs or network operations. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious activities are present. The code appears to serve as a testing suite for proper context and attribute handling, which is typical and expected for such purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard test suite for OpenTelemetry Celery instrumentation utilities. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
