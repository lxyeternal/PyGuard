  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential input sources include environment variables, network interfaces, file I/O, and user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve dynamic code execution functions (exec/eval), network transmissions, file modifications, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network data flow into code execution or data processing functions, which may lead to data exfiltration or system compromise.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (e.g., encoded strings, misleading variable names), use of eval/exec without validation, lack of comments/documentation, suspicious imports, or dynamic code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts. The suspicion is supported by high obfuscation scores (0.8) and moderate malware likelihood (0.4). No concrete malicious activity is confirmed, but the indicators justify a cautious approach. Benign code shows standard patterns with no anomalies. The scores align with the descriptions, with the primary concern in Report 1 due to obfuscation and dynamic code use. Other reports are consistent with benign assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears mostly benign, with some suspicion in Report 1 based on obfuscation and dynamic execution indicators. The current scores are appropriate; however, confirmation of obfuscation and code behavior is recommended for precise risk assessment.",
