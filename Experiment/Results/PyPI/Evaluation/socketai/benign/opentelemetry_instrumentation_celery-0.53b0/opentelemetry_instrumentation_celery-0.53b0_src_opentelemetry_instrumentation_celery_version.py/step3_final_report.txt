  "purpose": "This code serves as a license header and defines the version of the package, providing metadata about the software.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only contains comments and a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code is static and metadata-only.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code does not process or transfer data dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version assignment, with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent and appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose. The confidence level is high (1), as the code is straightforward and standard. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected, and the code poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard license header and version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
