  "purpose": "The code sets the version of the package and includes license information for open-source distribution.",
  "sources": "The version string __version__ and license comments at the beginning of the file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points that process untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; comments and version assignment are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, containing only licensing comments and a version variable assignment. There are no functions, data processing, or external input handling. This is typical for a header or metadata file in a Python package. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as package metadata and license information with no malicious intent or security risks.",
