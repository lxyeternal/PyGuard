{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup and build configuration script for the 'rjsmin' Python package, managing package metadata, optional C extension compilation, and environment-based build options.",
  "sources": "Reads documentation files, version info from source files, environment variables (e.g., CFLAGS), and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or untrusted data processing detected.",
  "flows": "Local reading of files and environment variables; no external data flow or untrusted input processing beyond standard build configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic identified.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks, including reading documentation and version info, configuring build extensions, and handling build errors. It does not contain obfuscated code, network activity, or malicious payloads. The scoring of malware as 0 and obfuscation as 0 is justified. The low security risk score (~0.2) reflects the inherent complexity of build scripts but no actual security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
