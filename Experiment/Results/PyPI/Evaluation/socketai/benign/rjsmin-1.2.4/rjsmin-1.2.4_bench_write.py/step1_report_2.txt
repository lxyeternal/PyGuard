{
  "purpose": "The script generates benchmark result reports in both table and plain formats based on pickled input data.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from standard input via pickle.load, and file contents are read/written using open().",
  "sinks": "Data is written to specified files; the code also writes to standard error and standard output streams.",
  "flows": "Data flows from stdin (pickled input) through loading into variables, then into report generation functions which write to files; no untrusted data is sent over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code processes data for reporting purposes only. No obfuscated code features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured reporting tool for benchmarks, performing data parsing, sorting, and formatting for output files. It handles multiple Python versions and formats data into tables or plain text. No code injection, remote network communication, or malicious activities are present. Use of standard libraries and straightforward data handling indicates a benign purpose. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security threats were identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate benchmark reporting utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It processes input data securely and outputs formatted reports, with no suspicious or malicious code behavior detected.",
