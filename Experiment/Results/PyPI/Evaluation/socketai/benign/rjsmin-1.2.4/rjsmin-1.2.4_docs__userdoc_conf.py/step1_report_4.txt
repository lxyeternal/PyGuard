  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation build, primarily setting up project metadata, theme, extensions, and output options.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, os; hardcoded project info; configuration variables; setup function; string literals in rst_prolog and other settings.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or output; no network calls, file writes, or command executions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration variables are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; all code appears to be standard documentation configuration with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file, setting project info, theme, static paths, and extensions. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or data handling of untrusted input is present. The string literals and setup functions are typical for documentation build scripts. No obfuscated code, malicious routines, or security risks are detected. The file's purpose is solely to configure documentation generation, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or supply chain threats. It is safe and purely functional for documentation setup.",
