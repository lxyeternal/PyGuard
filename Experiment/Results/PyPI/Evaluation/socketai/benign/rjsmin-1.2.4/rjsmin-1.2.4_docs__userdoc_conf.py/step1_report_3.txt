  "sources": "Import statements (sys, os), configuration variables, function definitions",
  "sinks": "None evident; no direct data output or external data transmission points",
  "flows": "Initialization and configuration data flow within the script; no untrusted data flows identified",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected; setup code is standard and typical for Sphinx configs",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior. It imports common modules, defines configuration variables, and includes a setup function to add a CSS file. No user input handling, data transmission, or external code execution features are present. The code mainly contains static configuration settings for documentation generation, theme selection, and project info. There are no suspicious functions, obfuscated code, or potentially harmful operations. Overall, the script is a benign setup file for documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script with no malicious or suspicious features. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security risks. The script is safe for use and appears to be a legitimate configuration file.",
