  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building rJSmin documentation using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, os); configuration variables; setup function; static and theme paths; Prolog strings.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially harmful operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external or untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules (sys, os) and defines static configuration parameters for documentation generation, including theme, extensions, paths, and project info. The setup function adds a CSS file but does not execute any dynamic or untrusted code. The rest of the code consists of comments and static variables for documentation purposes. There are no external input sources, network operations, or data handling routines that could lead to security issues. Overall, it is a typical, safe Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or risky code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign Sphinx documentation configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
