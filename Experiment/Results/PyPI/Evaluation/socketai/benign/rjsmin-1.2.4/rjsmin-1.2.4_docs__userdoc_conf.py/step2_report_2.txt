  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports identify the code as a standard Sphinx configuration file.\n- No external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is static, well-structured, and intended solely for documentation setup.\n- Malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are consistently reported as 0 or 0.5 at most, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- No report mentions any code that could be malicious or suspicious.\n- The only potential concern could be the inclusion of the `setup()` function that adds a CSS file, but this is standard practice and not risky.\n- No anomalies, such as obfuscation or dynamic execution, are present.\n- The code does not perform any file writes, network communication, or execute untrusted data.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- Malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate given the benign analysis.\n- Obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Risk scores are at most 0.5 in some reports, but given the complete absence of malicious or risky behavior, a score of 0 is more justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate; the code is a typical, safe Sphinx configuration file.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The overall risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should remain at **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code poses no security threat, malware, or malicious intent. It is a standard configuration file for documentation purposes.",
