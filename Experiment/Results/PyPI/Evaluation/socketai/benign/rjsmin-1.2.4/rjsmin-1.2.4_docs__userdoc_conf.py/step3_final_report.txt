  "purpose": "This code is a static configuration file for Sphinx documentation generation, setting up extensions, themes, and project metadata without executing any dynamic or malicious code.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`sys`, `os`), static variable assignments, function definitions (`setup()`), and string literals.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input, output, or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, static, and well-structured with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated segments. It only defines static variables and a setup function for styling. All signals indicate benign, intended use for documentation setup. No malicious routines, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration file for Sphinx documentation, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe for inclusion in the supply chain.",
