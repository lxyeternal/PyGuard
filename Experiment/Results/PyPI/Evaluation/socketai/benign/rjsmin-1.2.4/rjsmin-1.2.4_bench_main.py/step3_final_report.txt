  "purpose": "Benchmark jsmin implementations.",
  "sources": "Reads JavaScript files, environment info via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "Outputs results to stdout; serializes data using pickle.",
  "flows": "File reading -> minification -> output or serialization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle for serialization, dynamic module imports, but all are standard and benign in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a performance benchmarking utility for multiple JavaScript minifiers. It reads files, dynamically imports optional modules, times minification, and outputs or serializes results. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The use of pickle is limited to writing data, which is safe here. Dynamic imports are handled with exception handling, typical for optional dependencies. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or credentials are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate benchmarking tool with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate benign behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are accurate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
