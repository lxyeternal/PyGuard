  "purpose": "This code contains header comments, license information, author metadata, and encoding declarations for the rJSMin tests module.",
  "sources": "The code reads input primarily from the license headers, author comments, and encoding declarations.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or data leaks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code consists solely of static comments and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign header block with license, author, and encoding info. It contains no executable code, data processing, or external interactions. The non-ASCII characters are part of author names and do not indicate obfuscation. There are no data flows or sinks, and no suspicious patterns or malicious intent are detected. The code's structure and content are typical for documentation headers, with no security risks or malware behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign header or documentation block with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
