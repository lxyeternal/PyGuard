  "purpose": "A Python-based JavaScript minifier that reduces code size using regex patterns, with optional C extension for speed.",
  "sources": "Reads JavaScript code from stdin, processes it with regex substitutions, and outputs minified code to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Processed script output; no untrusted data execution or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from stdin through regex-based processing functions to output stream.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard regex minification logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a transparent, regex-driven JavaScript minifier with optional C extension (_rjsmin). It reads input, applies complex regex substitutions to remove whitespace and comments, and outputs minified code. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The regex approach is typical for minifiers and does not imply malicious intent. The optional C extension is a performance optimization, not a security concern. The code does not execute untrusted code or perform network operations. Minor risk score (0.1) accounts for potential regex limitations when processing malicious input, but this is theoretical, not actual malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious JavaScript minifier with no security risks or malware. The low risk score reflects the inherent limitations of regex-based minification but does not indicate any active threat.",
