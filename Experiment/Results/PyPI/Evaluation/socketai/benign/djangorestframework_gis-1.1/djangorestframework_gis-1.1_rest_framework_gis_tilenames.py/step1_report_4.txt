{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to convert between latitude/longitude and tile coordinates for slippy map schemes, specifically for OpenStreetMap tile calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; all functions operate on parameters passed directly to them.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not write to files, network, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; functions process input parameters and return computed values without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains straightforward mathematical calculations for map tiling, using standard formulas for Mercator projection. It only performs mathematical operations with no external data fetching, network communication, or execution of dynamic code. The functions are pure and self-contained, and the module is well-documented. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of map tiling calculations for slippy maps. It appears legitimate, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe for use in mapping applications.",
