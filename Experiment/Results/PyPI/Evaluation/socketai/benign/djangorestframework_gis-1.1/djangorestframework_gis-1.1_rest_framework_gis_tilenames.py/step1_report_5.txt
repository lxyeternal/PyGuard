{
  "purpose": "The code converts between latitude/longitude coordinates and slippy-map tile numbering scheme used in web maps like OpenStreetMap.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters: y, x, z (tile coordinates and zoom level). No external input sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations; the code mainly computes geographic and tile coordinate transformations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (x, y, z) through coordinate calculations to return tile edges or latitude/longitude edges.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected. The functions perform standard mathematical calculations for map tiling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to calculate tile edges and geographic coordinates using mathematical formulas based on Mercator projection. It imports only standard math functions without executing any untrusted data or external code. No suspicious or malicious operations are present. The logic is straightforward and consistent with standard map tile computations. There are no embedded backdoors, network activities, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of map tile calculations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
