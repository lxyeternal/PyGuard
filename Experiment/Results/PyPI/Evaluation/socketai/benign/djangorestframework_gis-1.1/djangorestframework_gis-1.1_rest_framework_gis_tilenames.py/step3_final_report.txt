{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to convert between latitude/longitude and slippy map tile coordinates, facilitating map rendering and geographic calculations.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (x, y, z) representing tile indices and zoom level; internal calculations using math functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data input/output; functions return computed geographic edges based on input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input tile coordinates (x, y, z) flow into functions which process them mathematically to produce geographic edges (lat/lon).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and deterministic.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard mathematical formulas for Mercator projection and tile calculations, with no external dependencies or network activity. It is a pure utility module with well-documented functions. No suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The functions do not process untrusted input in a way that could lead to security issues; they perform mathematical transformations only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility for geographic and map tile calculations. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence in this assessment is supported by the code's simplicity and the consistent analysis across multiple reports.",
