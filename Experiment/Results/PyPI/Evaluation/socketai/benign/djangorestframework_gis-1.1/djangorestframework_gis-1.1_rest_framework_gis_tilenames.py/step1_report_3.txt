{
  "purpose": "The code translates between latitude/longitude coordinates and slippy-map tile numbering scheme used by OpenStreetMap.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as y, z, x, which are used in tile calculations.",
  "sinks": "Return values from functions; no untrusted data being written or sent anywhere, no network or file output observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (x, y, z) are used within functions to compute geographic boundaries, with no data transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present. The code performs straightforward mathematical calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports math functions, defines helper functions for tile calculations, and performs geographic coordinate conversions. No code reads external input dynamically (e.g., from files, network, environment variables). The functions accept parameters and produce outputs based solely on these inputs. No code executes untrusted code, accesses system resources, or contains hidden backdoors. The implementation is standard and well-understood for map tile computations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of map tile calculations without any malicious behavior or security risks. It performs geographic computations in a safe manner and does not exhibit any suspicious or harmful features.",
