{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to convert between latitude/longitude coordinates and tile numbering schemes used in slippy maps, primarily for map tile calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters (x, y, z, mercatorY). No external data sources or user inputs are explicitly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output, network communication, or data storage. It only returns computed values.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (x, y, z, mercatorY) are processed through mathematical functions to produce geographic coordinate edges. There are no data flows to external sinks or untrusted outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The functions rely solely on standard math operations to perform coordinate calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of map tile coordinate conversions using well-known formulas involving Mercator projection mathematics. It uses standard math library functions without any dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The functions are deterministic and serve map rendering purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for geographic computations related to slippy maps. No malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
