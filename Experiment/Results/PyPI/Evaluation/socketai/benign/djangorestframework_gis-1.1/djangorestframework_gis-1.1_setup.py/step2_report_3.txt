  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The setup script is standard; no suspicious activity detected.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the script is a typical setup.py, reading README, importing get_version, and configuring setup(). No malicious code, no untrusted data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard setup.py with no suspicious code.\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; no malicious activity, straightforward code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Slight concern about `get_version()` because its implementation isn't shown.\n- **Assessment:** This is a valid point. The function `get_version()` is imported from `rest_framework_gis`, and without its source code, we can't guarantee it's safe. It could contain malicious code if compromised.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — reasonable, given the unknown nature of `get_version()`.\n- **Justification:** The report correctly flags the potential risk associated with the `get_version()` function, which could be malicious if malicious code is embedded there.\n- **Conclusion:** The cautious approach is justified. The overall code is benign, but the unknown implementation of `get_version()` warrants a low security risk score.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, with emphasis on the unknown `get_version()`.\n- **Assessment:** Same reasoning applies. The function's source isn't shown, so potential malicious behavior is possible if `get_version()` is compromised.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** No issues, standard setup script.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Analysis and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** For reports highlighting the `get_version()` function, a low but non-zero risk score (0.2) is justified due to the unknown implementation.\n\n### My own assessment:\n- The core setup script is standard and safe.\n- The only potential concern is the `get_version()` function, which is imported but not shown. If this function is malicious or compromised, it could execute arbitrary code during setup.\n- Given that, I would assign:\n  - **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n  - **Risk:** 0.2 (due to unknown implementation of `get_version()`)\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a typical setup.py script with no inherent malicious behavior.\n- The main point of concern is the `get_version()` function's source code, which should be reviewed to confirm it is safe.\n- No evidence suggests any security breach or malicious activity in the provided code.\n\n**Final notes:**  \nAlways verify the implementation of imported functions like `get_version()` to ensure they are not malicious, especially if they execute code dynamically or fetch data from untrusted sources.",
