  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'djangorestframework-gis' package, configuring package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file for long_description; importing get_version from rest_framework_gis.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or execute system commands; no network or I/O operations involving untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Reading README file -> setting package info -> calling get_version() -> configuring setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The only potentially unusual part is the use of get_version() from rest_framework_gis, but this is standard for version management, assuming get_version() is a legitimate function. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py file for a Python package. It reads a README file to include a long description and retrieves the package version via get_version() from rest_framework_gis. No user input, network communication, or code execution is present. All dependencies are listed explicitly. The code appears straightforward and standard for package distribution, with no suspicious or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It properly handles dependencies and metadata without engaging in any suspicious activity.",
