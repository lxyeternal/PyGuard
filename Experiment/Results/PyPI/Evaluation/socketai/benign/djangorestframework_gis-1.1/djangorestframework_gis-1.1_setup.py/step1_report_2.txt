{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for packaging and distributing the 'djangorestframework-gis' Python project.",
  "sources": "Reads the README file for long description; imports version info from 'rest_framework_gis'; uses standard setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; no network or file output of untrusted data is present.",
  "flows": "Reads data from the filesystem (README file) and module (get_version); no untrusted input flows to critical functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets; standard setup script structure.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: importing modules, reading a README for description, and configuring setup() with metadata and dependencies. The 'get_version()' function is imported from a local module, presumed safe as part of the package. No data is processed from untrusted sources, nor are there network connections or code execution based on external inputs. The code appears typical for Python packaging and contains no malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to configure the package metadata and dependencies. No malware or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
