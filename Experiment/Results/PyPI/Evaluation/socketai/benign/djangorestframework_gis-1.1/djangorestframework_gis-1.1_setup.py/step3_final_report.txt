{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script configures the packaging of the 'djangorestframework-gis' Python module, primarily reading the README for description and importing a version function.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file; importing get_version() from rest_framework_gis",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or code execution points",
  "flows": "Reading README -> importing get_version() -> passing version to setup()",
  "anomalies": "The only potential concern is the imported get_version() function, whose implementation isn't provided",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with no suspicious behavior. It reads a README file and calls an imported function for versioning. No untrusted data handling or malicious code is present. The only uncertainty involves get_version(), which could contain malicious code if compromised, but there's no evidence here. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given this uncertainty.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign and standard for Python packaging. The main point of review is the get_version() function's implementation. If it is verified to be safe, the overall security risk is negligible. The current assessment with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low risk score (around 0.2) is justified.",
