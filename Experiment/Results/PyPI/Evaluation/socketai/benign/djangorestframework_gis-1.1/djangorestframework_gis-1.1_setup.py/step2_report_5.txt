It uses `get_version()` from `rest_framework_gis`, which appears legitimate.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code is straightforward: reads README, imports `get_version()`, calls `setup()`.\n  - No untrusted data handling, no code execution, no network activity.\n  - `get_version()`'s implementation isn't shown, but it's presumed safe.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0 — reasonable.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with no suspicious code. The only potential concern is the `get_version()` function, but it's standard.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Same as above; no untrusted data, no network, no malicious code.\n  - `get_version()` presumed safe, as it's a typical version getter.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** The report notes that `get_version()`'s implementation isn't provided, which could be a concern if malicious.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The script itself is standard.\n  - The only unknown is `get_version()`, which could contain malicious code.\n  - The report assigns a SecurityRisk of 0.2, reflecting uncertainty.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (since no malicious code is confirmed)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 (reasonable given the unknown implementation)\n  - Confidence: 0.7 (moderate, due to uncertainty)\n\n- **Justification for risk score:** Since `get_version()` is imported from within the package, unless its implementation is malicious, the risk remains low. The cautious score is justified.\n\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is cautious but appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above; the main concern is the unknown `get_version()` implementation.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The script is standard.\n  - No suspicious patterns or code.\n  - The unknown `get_version()` could be malicious, but there's no evidence.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (high confidence in benign nature, but cautious due to unknowns).\n\n- **Verdict:** Sound reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as previous, with no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Standard setup script.\n  - No untrusted data or external network activity.\n  - The only unknown is `get_version()`, but it's assumed safe.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis\n\n- **Code presence of malware:** All reports correctly identify that the code itself is standard and does not contain malicious code.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; all reports agree.\n\n- **Security risk:** The only potential concern is the `get_version()` function, whose implementation isn't shown. The reports appropriately assign a low security risk (0.2) when mentioning this uncertainty.\n\n- **Scores consistency:** All are reasonable given the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\n- **Malware score:** I concur with all reports assigning 0, as no malicious code is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** Given the unknown `get_version()` implementation, a small risk (0.2) is justified. If the implementation of `get_version()` is verified to be safe, this score could be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (due to the unknown `get_version()` implementation)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, benign setup script. The only caveat is verifying the `get_version()` function's implementation to ensure it doesn't contain malicious code. If that function is safe, the overall security posture is very low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate and reasonable. The cautious approach regarding `get_version()` is justified. No further action needed unless the implementation of `get_version()` is found to be malicious.",
