  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard setup.py script. It reads the README file for the long description and imports `get_version()` from `rest_framework_gis`.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both are zero, which is appropriate.  \n- **Security Risk:** Zero, as no untrusted data or malicious behavior is evident.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues.\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, standard setup script with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Zero, consistent with the code.  \n- **Security Risk:** Zero.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, noting that `get_version()`'s implementation isn't provided, which could be a concern if malicious.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both zero, but the report flags `get_version()` as a potential risk.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2, reflecting uncertainty about `get_version()`.  \n- **Justification:** Since `get_version()` is imported from the package itself, it's likely safe unless the package has been compromised. Without seeing its implementation, the risk is low but not zero.  \n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable caution; the overall code is standard.\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, emphasizing that `get_version()` could be malicious if compromised, but no evidence in this script.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Zero.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2, acknowledging the unknown nature of `get_version()`.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous, no suspicious code or behavior.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Zero.  \n- **Security Risk:** Zero.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Evaluation\n\n- **Code Analysis:** All reports correctly identify that this is a typical setup.py script.  \n- **Potential Concern:** The only point of uncertainty is the `get_version()` function, which is imported but not shown. If `get_version()` contains malicious code, it could pose a risk. However, based on the code provided, there's no evidence of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscated code present)  \n  - **Risk:** Given the reliance on an external function whose implementation isn't visible, a small risk score (around 0.2) is justified, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- Verify the implementation of `get_version()` in the `rest_framework_gis` package to ensure it does not contain malicious code.\n- The current scores are appropriate: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.**",
