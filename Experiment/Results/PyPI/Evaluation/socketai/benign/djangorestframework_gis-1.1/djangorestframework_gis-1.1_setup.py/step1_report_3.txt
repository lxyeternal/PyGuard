{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'djangorestframework-gis' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file for long description, importing get_version from rest_framework_gis, and accessing environment variables indirectly through os.path and open.",
  "sinks": "No unsafe data sinks detected; no untrusted data is written or transmitted by this script.",
  "flows": "The version obtained from get_version() flows into the setup() call; no other source-to-sink data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The get_version() function's implementation is not provided, which could potentially contain malicious code. Other than that, no suspicious code or unusual behavior is observed in this setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup operations, such as reading a README file for description and configuring metadata. The only external function call is get_version(), which may contain arbitrary code; its implementation is not included, which could pose a risk if malicious. All other code involves standard setup procedures with no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious code constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code structure and usage are typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script appears standard and benign, with the only potential concern being the get_version() function, whose implementation is unknown and could potentially contain malicious code. Overall, the risk is low but warrants verifying get_version() source code for complete assurance.",
