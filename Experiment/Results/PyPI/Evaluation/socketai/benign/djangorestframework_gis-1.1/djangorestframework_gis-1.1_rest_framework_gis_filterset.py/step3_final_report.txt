  "purpose": "This code imports a class 'GeoFilterSet' from a local module 'filters' in a Python package, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module 'filters'. No external input or data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks, external communication, or system modifications occur.",
  "flows": "Import source (local module) to usage point; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is a straightforward import with suppression comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing 'GeoFilterSet' from a local module 'filters'. It does not involve data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. The presence of '# noqa' is a standard linter suppression, not suspicious. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of any anomalies or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence (1). The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no security risks or malicious behavior. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
