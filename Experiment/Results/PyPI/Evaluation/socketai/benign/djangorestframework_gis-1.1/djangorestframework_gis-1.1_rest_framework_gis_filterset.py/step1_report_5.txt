  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external output in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only imports a class without further data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import statement, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement referencing a local module 'filters' and a class 'GeoFilterSet'. It uses a standard import with a 'noqa' comment to suppress linter warnings. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident, and it does not involve any data processing, external communication, or risky behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears benign and typical for Python projects.",
