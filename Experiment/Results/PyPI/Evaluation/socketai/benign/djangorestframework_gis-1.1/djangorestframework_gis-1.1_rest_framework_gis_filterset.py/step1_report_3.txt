  "purpose": "Importing GeoFilterSet class from a local filters module, likely for filtering geolocation data.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module within the package",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable due to the simplicity of the code",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement importing a class named GeoFilterSet from a local module named filters. It uses a relative import, which is standard in Python packages. There is no dynamic code execution, no data input handling, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation detected. This appears to be a typical module import statement with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports a class for use within the package.",
