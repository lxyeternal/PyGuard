  "purpose": "Import the GeoFilterSet class from the filters module, likely for data filtering or validation.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing GeoFilterSet from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external output present.",
  "flows": "N/A, as this is only an import statement without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a comment to ignore linter warnings (# noqa), which is common but not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement, pulling in a class from a local module named filters. It includes a linter directive to ignore style issues. There is no data processing, no input/output, and no suspicious logic. The minimal nature of this code reduces the likelihood of malicious intent or malicious behavior.\n\nNo external network activity, no sensitive data handling, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns are evident. The import suggests this is part of a larger project, but on its own, it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard part of a Python module, and there are no anomalies or suspicious elements present.",
