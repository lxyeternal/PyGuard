{
  "purpose": "This code implements a custom pagination class for REST API responses, specifically formatted for GeoJSON FeatureCollections.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as 'page_size' from query parameters (via 'page_size_query_param') and data passed into 'get_paginated_response'. It also calls methods like 'get_next_link', 'get_previous_link', and superclass methods.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a structured Response object containing paginated data. No untrusted data is directly written to system resources or external endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input from query parameters influences pagination, and the 'data' argument is used to generate the response. The data 'features' are included in the response, but no dynamic evaluation or external data manipulation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard DRF pagination methods and data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom pagination class for GeoJSON responses, overriding 'get_paginated_response' to structure the output as a FeatureCollection. It relies on inherited methods for pagination links and counts, with no user input manipulation or external data handling that could be malicious. The schema adjustment in 'get_paginated_response_schema' is standard for API schema customization. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. The implementation appears straightforward and adheres to common REST framework practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom pagination class for GeoJSON data, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve its intended purpose without any malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
