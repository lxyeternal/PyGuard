{
  "purpose": "To implement a custom geoJSON pagination serializer for a REST API using Django REST Framework.",
  "sources": "Input data likely comes from the 'data' parameter in get_paginated_response, which is provided by the API view.",
  "sinks": "Response object returned by get_paginated_response, which outputs a formatted JSON response; no direct untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input data ('data') flows into the response payload as 'features'; no untrusted data flows into system commands or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward, utilizing standard library and DRF classes; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code extends DRF's PageNumberPagination to customize the JSON response structure for geoJSON format. It formats the response with specific properties, using OrderedDict to maintain key order. No external data manipulation, no dynamic code execution, and no insecure handling of data are observed. The schema modification adjusts the expected response schema but does not introduce security issues. The code uses standard libraries and practices consistent with REST API development.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard, well-structured pagination response for geoJSON data. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The code appears to be purely functional, without malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
