  "purpose": "Implement a custom geoJSON pagination serializer for REST API responses.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from the 'data' parameter in get_paginated_response; reading pagination info from self.page and self.page.paginator.",
  "targets": "Response object construction using data['features'], schema modifications in get_paginated_response_schema.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'data' parameter into the 'features' field in the response; schema modifications adapt the response schema.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or unusual code structures. The schema modification is standard for API documentation adjustments.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the REST framework's pagination to produce geoJSON formatted responses. It reads data from the provided 'data' dict, which must include 'features'. The response construction uses OrderedDict to ensure order, returning a JSON structure with geoJSON-specific keys. The schema modification adjusts the OpenAPI schema to reflect the 'FeatureCollection' type. No untrusted input sources, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The code performs standard data formatting and schema adjustments without any suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of geoJSON pagination serialization for REST API responses. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The modifications are standard for schema representation and response formatting.",
