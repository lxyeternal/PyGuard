  "purpose": "Implement a custom pagination class for GeoJSON data in a Django REST Framework API.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or untrusted data; relies on framework-provided data structures and methods.",
  "targets": "None of the code processes untrusted data directly; responses are constructed from framework data.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks that cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward subclassing of pagination with schema adjustments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of PageNumberPagination with customized response formatting for GeoJSON features. It uses standard DRF methods and OrderedDict for structuring the response. No external data is read directly, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no network calls or obfuscation. The schema modification is purely for API documentation purposes. The code appears to be standard, safe, and intended for formatting API responses.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a custom pagination response for GeoJSON data without any malicious or suspicious elements. It is secure and does not pose a supply chain or runtime security risk.",
