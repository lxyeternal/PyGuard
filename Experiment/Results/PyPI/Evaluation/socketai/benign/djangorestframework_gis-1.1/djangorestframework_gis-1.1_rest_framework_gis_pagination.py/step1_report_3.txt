{
  "purpose": "Implement custom pagination for GeoJSON data in a Django REST Framework API.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'data' parameter in get_paginated_response; inherits from PageNumberPagination which may read query parameters.",
  "sinks": "Returns a Response object with ordered data; no direct data sinks or external data outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Query parameters (page_size) → get_paginated_response → Response with geoJSON structure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Code appears straightforward with standard DRF pagination customization.",
  "analysis": "The code extends DRF's pagination to output geoJSON FeatureCollection format, which is typical for spatial data APIs. It manipulates response schema for documentation purposes. No external data inputs, secret handling, or code execution features are present. The code is clean, structured, and uses standard libraries and patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom paginator for GeoJSON data in a REST API. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It solely modifies pagination response formatting, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
