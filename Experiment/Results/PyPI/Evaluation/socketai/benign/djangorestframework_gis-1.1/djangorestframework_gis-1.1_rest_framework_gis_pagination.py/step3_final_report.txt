{
  "purpose": "A custom pagination serializer for GeoJSON FeatureCollection responses in a REST API.",
  "sources": "Data passed into get_paginated_response, query parameters for page size, inherited methods for links.",
  "sinks": "None; response is constructed from framework data, no external data or untrusted input processed.",
  "flows": "Framework provides paginated data -> get_paginated_response formats response -> schema modification for documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code subclasses DRF's PageNumberPagination, customizing the response to match GeoJSON structure. It uses standard methods and constructs responses with OrderedDict. Schema modifications are for API documentation and do not affect runtime behavior. No external data, secrets, or dynamic code execution are involved. The code is straightforward, relying on well-established libraries and patterns, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of a custom pagination class for GeoJSON data. It poses no security, malware, or obfuscation concerns, and the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate.",
