  "purpose": "Define serializers for handling GeoJSON data in Django REST Framework, supporting geojson features and feature collections.",
  "sources": "Reads model attributes, serializer fields, and input data (e.g., 'properties', 'geometry', 'id', 'bbox') from incoming requests and model instances.",
  "sinks": "Generates GeoJSON formatted output with 'type', 'features', 'geometry', 'properties', 'id', and 'bbox' keys; processes input data for deserialization.",
  "flows": "Extracts data from model instances and input data, transforms into geojson structure; processes 'properties', 'geometry', 'bbox', 'id'; unformats geojson into serializer fields for internal storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network activities present. Checks for correct configuration and field management, but no hidden malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements serializers for geographic data, carefully managing fields and ensuring correct GeoJSON formatting. It includes validation for configuration, proper handling of properties, and unformatting logic for incoming geojson data. No external network calls, file operations, or malicious behaviors are evident. The use of standard Django and DRF classes and methods reduces risk. Overall, the implementation appears clean and aligned with expected functionality, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured implementation of geojson serializers for Django REST Framework, serving its purpose without exhibiting malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly handles data serialization/deserialization and configuration validation, with no indication of sabotage or malware.",
