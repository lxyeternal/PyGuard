  "purpose": "Serializer classes for converting Django models to GeoJSON features and feature collections, and vice versa, with validation and configuration checks.",
  "sources": "Model fields such as 'geo_field', 'bbox_geo_field', and input GeoJSON data in 'to_internal_value' and 'unformat_geojson'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from 'to_internal_value' and 'unformat_geojson' into serializer fields; output flows from 'to_representation' into GeoJSON format.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. Validation checks are explicit and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of GeoJSON serializers for Django REST Framework, handling serialization/deserialization with validation. It performs configuration checks, manages GeoJSON structure, and processes spatial data using standard libraries. No external calls, code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The input handling assumes trust but is typical for such serializers. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs expected serialization tasks without malicious intent. The low malware and security risk scores are justified. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
