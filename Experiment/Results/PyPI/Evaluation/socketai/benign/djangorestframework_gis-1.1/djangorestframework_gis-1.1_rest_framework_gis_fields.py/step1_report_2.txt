  "purpose": "Define custom Django REST Framework fields for handling GeoDjango geometry data and serialization to GeoJSON format.",
  "sources": "Input data from API requests, particularly the 'value' parameter in to_internal_value and to_representation methods; JSON strings in GeoJsonDict constructor.",
  "sinks": "Potentially passes data to GEOSGeometry constructor, which can process untrusted data; returns geojson structures in to_representation.",
  "flows": "Input data → to_internal_value parses and converts to GEOSGeometry object → to_representation serializes geometry to GeoJSON dict.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. Uses exception handling for invalid inputs. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides custom serialization/deserialization for geographic data in a Django REST Framework context. It handles GeoJSON formatting, precision rounding, and duplicate removal. The use of GEOSGeometry and related exception handling appears standard. No evident malicious intent, hidden code, or malicious network activity is present. The GeoJsonDict class handles string inputs safely with json.loads. Overall, the code performs expected GIS data processing without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This module offers standard GIS serialization/deserialization functionality with proper error handling. There are no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. The code appears safe and aligned with its purpose, with no malicious intent detected.",
