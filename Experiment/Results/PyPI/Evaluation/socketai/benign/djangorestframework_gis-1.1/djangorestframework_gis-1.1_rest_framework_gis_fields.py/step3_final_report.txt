  "purpose": "Handle serialization and deserialization of GeoDjango Geometry fields within Django REST Framework, converting between Python objects and GeoJSON representations.",
  "sources": "Input data received via API requests, JSON strings, and GEOSGeometry instances.",
  "sinks": "GEOSGeometry objects, GeoJSON dictionaries, and JSON responses.",
  "flows": "Input data (JSON or GEOSGeometry) -> to_internal_value (parsing and validation) -> GEOSGeometry object -> to_representation (serialization to GeoJSON) -> output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of json.loads in GeoJsonDict constructor is standard; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected. Exception handling is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard GIS serialization/deserialization functions with proper validation and exception handling. No external network calls, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code are present. JSON parsing is safely confined to data conversion. The logic for coordinate rounding and redundant point removal is straightforward and not malicious. The exception handling ensures invalid data does not cause security issues. Overall, the code performs expected GIS data handling tasks securely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured GIS serializer for Django REST Framework with no malicious or suspicious activity. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
