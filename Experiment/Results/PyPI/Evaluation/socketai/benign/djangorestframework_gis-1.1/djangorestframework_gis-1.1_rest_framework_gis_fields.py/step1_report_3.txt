  "purpose": "Define custom Django REST Framework fields for handling GeoDjango geometries and serialize them into GeoJSON format.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.contrib.gis, django.core.exceptions, django.utils.translation, rest_framework.fields, and internal methods and properties within the classes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe JSON handling in __init__ of GeoJsonDict, but it only attempts to parse strings as JSON; no direct data sinks to untrusted sources observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input values in to_representation or to_internal_value methods, possibly through json.dumps and GEOSGeometry conversions; no external network or system calls are made.",
  "anomalies": "Use of json.loads with exception handling, but no dangerous code execution or unsafe dynamic evaluation observed. The code handles geometries and conversions securely, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom serializer fields for GeoDjango objects, converting them to and from GeoJSON format. It includes validation, geometry processing, and optional features like precision control, duplicate removal, and bounding box addition. The GeoJsonDict class attempts to parse strings as JSON, which is safe given the context; it only processes JSON data without executing or evaluating it. No external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious modifications are present. The code does not contain obfuscated elements, backdoors, or suspicious external calls.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom Django REST Framework serializer fields for handling geographic data in GeoJSON format. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. It appears safe and aligned with typical geographic data processing practices.",
