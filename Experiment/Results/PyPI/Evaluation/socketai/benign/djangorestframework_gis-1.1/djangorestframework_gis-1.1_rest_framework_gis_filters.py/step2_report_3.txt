  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements spatial filters in Django REST Framework, handling parameters like 'in_bbox', 'tile', 'point', 'dist', 'order'. It validates input, constructs spatial objects, and applies ORM filters.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies standard spatial filtering practices, proper validation, and no malicious behavior. The reasoning is sound.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n- **Justification:** Given the code's nature, these scores seem appropriate. The low security risk reflects normal spatial filtering, and no malware is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard GIS filters, safe input handling, and no suspicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's purpose. No anomalies or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk score might be due to the general concern about untrusted input, but overall, the code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard spatial filters, input from request.query_params, no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous analyses. The code performs typical spatial filtering with proper validation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Justification:** Similar reasoning; the risk score remains low, appropriate for the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles spatial filters, with input parsing and ORM filtering, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis confirms standard implementation, no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n\n- **Justification:** No security concerns; the risk score is appropriately zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard geospatial filters, proper input validation, no malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no red flags.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n- **Justification:** The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, and given the code's nature—standard spatial filtering in Django with proper validation—this is correct. No malicious activity or backdoors are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is appropriate. The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0 to 0.2 across reports, reflecting low security risk. The code accepts user input but performs standard validation and filtering. No dangerous operations or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — very low, consistent with the analysis; no significant security issues.\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The only potential concern could be the handling of untrusted input, but the code uses proper validation and exception handling.\n- The distance conversion function is approximate but not malicious; it's a known method in GIS.\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided scores are reasonable and align with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimated Score |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                     |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1                   |\n\nThis reflects a standard, well-implemented spatial filtering module with no malicious or obfuscated code, and minimal security risk.",
