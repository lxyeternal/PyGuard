{
  "purpose": "The code provides filters for geographic queries using Django REST Framework and GeoDjango, enabling spatial filtering such as bounding boxes, tiles, and distance-based queries.",
  "sources": "Input sources include request.query_params for bbox strings, tile strings, point coordinates, and distances.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily constructs spatial filter objects and applies them to querysets. No direct sinks like system commands, network connections, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input from query_params flows into spatial filter functions, creating geometry objects (Polygon, Point), which are then used in ORM filter queries.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for spatial filtering; no suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are evident. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs spatial filtering based on input parameters for bounding boxes, tiles, and distances, using standard Django and GeoDjango features. Input validation is handled with ParseError exceptions. No external system calls, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The logic relies on well-established spatial queries and standard library functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of spatial query filters for a Django REST Framework application. It processes user-provided spatial data securely, with proper validation and without suspicious or malicious behavior. No malware or security risks are detected.",
