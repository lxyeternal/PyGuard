  "purpose": "Provides spatial filtering capabilities for Django REST Framework, including bounding box, tile, and distance-based filters, with input validation and ORM query integration.",
  "sources": "Request query parameters for spatial bounds ('in_bbox', 'tile', 'point', 'dist', 'order'), and view attributes defining filter fields.",
  "sinks": "Django ORM filters applying spatial queries; potential for malformed input to influence query behavior but no direct data leaks or malicious system calls.",
  "flows": "User input from request.query_params parsed and validated, then used to construct spatial objects (Polygon, Point), which are applied via ORM filters to the queryset.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard use of Django GIS features; input validation is proper; no obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard spatial filtering with proper validation and exception handling. It parses user input for bounding boxes, tiles, and points, converting them into spatial objects. These are then used in ORM filters with appropriate lookup types. The distance filter includes a conversion from meters to degrees, which is a common GIS practice. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The input validation via ParseError is appropriate, and the use of external libraries is standard. The overall structure is clear and adheres to best practices for spatial filtering in Django.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented spatial filtering module with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The low risk and malware scores are justified, and the assessments in the reports are accurate.",
