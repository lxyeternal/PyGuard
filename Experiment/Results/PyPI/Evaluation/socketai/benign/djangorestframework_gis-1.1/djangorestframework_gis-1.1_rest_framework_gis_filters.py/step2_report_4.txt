  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the issues, reasoning, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements spatial filters in Django, with input validation and no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code reads user input (bbox, tile, point, distance, order), parses it, and applies spatial filters.\n  - Input validation via ParseError is appropriate.\n  - No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n  - No external system calls or data exfiltration.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Risk: 0.1 — acceptable, given the standard filtering logic.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment is accurate. The code is standard spatial filtering with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard spatial filters with proper validation.\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No suspicious patterns, no malicious code.\n  - Input validation appears correct.\n  - No external calls or data leaks.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment; no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard spatial filters, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Same pattern: request parameters parsed, used in ORM filters.\n  - Proper validation with ParseError.\n  - No signs of malicious code.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard spatial filtering.\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No suspicious or malicious behavior.\n  - Input validation appears proper.\n  - No external or dangerous operations.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Risk: 0 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard spatial filters.\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No malicious activity.\n  - Input validation is appropriate.\n  - No external system calls or data leaks.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Risk: 0.1 — acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Analysis:** All reports correctly identify that the code performs spatial filtering based on user input, with proper validation and no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero but low, reflecting normal operational risk, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — acceptable for spatial filtering code accepting user input.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly assess that the code is a standard, well-validated spatial filtering module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk score is justified, and the overall security posture appears sound.",
