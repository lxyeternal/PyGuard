  "purpose": "This code maps Django GIS model fields to JSON schemas for API documentation, facilitating schema generation for geographic data types.",
  "sources": "Reads model fields via model_meta and serializer fields, primarily for schema mapping; no external data sources or untrusted input handling.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data exfiltration points; purely static schema generation without external communication.",
  "flows": "Uses model and serializer metadata to produce JSON schema components for GIS fields; no runtime data flow involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Warnings issued for unsupported fields are benign and informational; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static utility for generating JSON schemas for GIS fields in Django REST Framework. It maps model fields to schema components, issues warnings for unsupported fields, and handles various GIS types. No external network activity, data leaks, or code execution occurs. Warnings are benign and serve as notices for unsupported customizations. The code is well-structured, readable, and purpose-specific, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a schema generator for geographic data in Django REST Framework. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The warnings are benign and do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, it is a safe, benign utility for API documentation purposes.",
