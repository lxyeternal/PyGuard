{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom OpenAPI schema class for mapping Django GIS model fields to JSON schema, specifically for GeoJSON features and geometries, to support API documentation generation.",
  "sources": "Imports from Django models, REST framework schemas, serializers, and custom fields; class attributes and methods accessing serializer fields, model fields, and static schema definitions.",
  "sinks": "Usage of serializer fields and model fields to produce schema; warnings are issued for unsupported geometry types; no direct data sinks or external network operations.",
  "flows": "Serializer field access → _map_geo_field or _map_geo_feature_model_serializer → schema construction, including optional warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs. The warnings are informational for unsupported geometry fields. No data leaks or malicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a schema mapping class for generating GeoJSON schemas from Django GIS models. It defines schema templates for different geometry types and constructs property schemas based on model fields and serializer configuration. There are no indications of malicious behavior; the warnings are standard and relate to unsupported geometry serialization. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code functions purely for documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a schema mapping utility for Django REST Framework with GIS extensions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign, well-structured schema generator for GeoJSON features. There is low confidence in any malicious activity detection.",
