{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom OpenAPI schema generator for geographic data models in Django REST Framework, specifically mapping Django GIS fields to JSON schema for API documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from Django models, REST Framework, and rest_framework_gis; use of serializer classes, model fields, and GeoField schemas.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code primarily generates schemas without executing or handling external data inputs at runtime.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code maps serializer fields to JSON schema definitions for API documentation purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Warnings are used for unsupported fields, not for malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically maps geographic Django model fields to corresponding JSON schema components, including Point, LineString, Polygon, and their multi-geometry counterparts. It handles schema definitions, warns about unsupported geometry fields, and manages serializer types. No code execution based on untrusted input, network operations, or data leakage mechanisms are present. It appears to be a schema generation utility with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a schema generator for GIS-related API documentation, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs structured mapping of model fields to JSON schemas, using warnings for unsupported features. Overall, it appears safe and intended solely for schema generation.",
