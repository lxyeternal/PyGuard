{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom OpenAPI schema for geographic data models in Django REST Framework, mapping various spatial fields to JSON schema definitions for API documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes, class inheritance structures, serializer fields, and model meta information. It also accesses model fields via 'model_meta.get_field_info' and serializer.Meta attributes.",
  "sinks": "The code generates JSON schema components, warnings, and mappings; it does not execute external commands, handle raw user input, or write to files. No untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "The schema mapping functions read model and serializer metadata (sources) and produce JSON schema definitions (sinks), with flow passing through mapping methods (_map_geo_field, map_serializer). There is no dynamic execution or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are warnings issued via 'warnings.warn', but these are informational. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically maps spatial Django model fields to JSON schema representations for API documentation. It uses static mappings, class inheritance, and model meta info. No external data handling or suspicious behavior is observed. The use of warnings and static attribute access aligns with standard schema generation patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, schema-mapping utility for geographic models in Django REST Framework. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to generate API documentation schemas.",
