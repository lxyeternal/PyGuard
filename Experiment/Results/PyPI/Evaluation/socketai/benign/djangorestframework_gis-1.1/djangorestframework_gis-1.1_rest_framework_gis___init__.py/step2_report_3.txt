  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as handling version information and conditional Django configuration.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The logic is straightforward, involving version string construction and optional Django import with version checks.\n- No external input, untrusted data, or security-critical operations are involved.\n- The code appears safe, standard, and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description; no discrepancies.\n- **Malware presence:** All reports agree malware score is 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and not obfuscated; scores are 0.\n- **Security risk:** No security risks are evident; scores are 0.\n\n### Critical review of scores:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- No reason to adjust these scores; they reflect the code's benign nature accurately.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The only minor point is the use of `default_app_config = 'rest_framework_gis.apps.AppConfig'` in some reports. This is a standard Django pattern, but in newer Django versions, `default_app_config` is deprecated in favor of `AppConfig` subclasses. However, this is not a security concern, just a versioning/configuration note.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the total lack of suspicious activity, should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical version and configuration handler with no malicious or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the code is safe, and the scoring reflects that.",
