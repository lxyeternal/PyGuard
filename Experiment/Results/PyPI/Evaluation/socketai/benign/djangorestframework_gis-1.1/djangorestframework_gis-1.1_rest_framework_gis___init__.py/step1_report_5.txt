{
  "purpose": "Define and retrieve the version string of the package, and conditionally set a default Django app configuration based on Django version.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the VERSION tuple, and imports the django module if available.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns a string to default_app_config if certain conditions are met; this is a benign assignment.",
  "flows": "Version tuple is used to construct a version string; import and version check influence setting of default_app_config.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution or data leaks present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines versioning information and performs a conditional import to set a configuration based on Django version. The get_version() function assembles a version string from a predefined tuple, including handling pre-alpha tags. The import of django is enclosed in a try-except block, avoiding errors if Django is not installed. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard version and configuration setup with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
