{
  "purpose": "Define and retrieve the version of a software package, and conditionally set a Django application configuration based on Django version.",
  "sources": "The VERSION tuple, the get_version() function, and the import statement for django.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the use of import django and accessing django.VERSION if installed.",
  "flows": "The get_version() function constructs a version string from the VERSION tuple. The import and version check flow leads to setting default_app_config if django is present and version is less than 3.2.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual dynamic execution observed. The code appears straightforward, with version handling and conditional import.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version tuple and a function to generate a version string. It conditionally sets a configuration based on whether Django is installed and its version. The logic is typical for package versioning and conditional configuration; no suspicious or malicious behavior is present. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The import is standard, and the version check is safe. No data leaks or malicious sinks are involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version and configuration handler with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for a Python package module.",
