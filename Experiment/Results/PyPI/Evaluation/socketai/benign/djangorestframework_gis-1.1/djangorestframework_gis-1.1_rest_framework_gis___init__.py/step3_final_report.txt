{
  "purpose": "The code defines a version tuple, constructs a version string with optional pre-alpha labeling, and conditionally sets a Django app configuration based on the Django version installed.",
  "sources": "The version tuple (VERSION), the get_version() function, and the import statement for Django.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input or data; it only constructs version strings and sets a configuration variable based on a version check.",
  "flows": "The get_version() function reads the VERSION tuple to produce a version string; the import block reads the Django module and its version to determine whether to set default_app_config.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for version handling and compatibility settings.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a version string based on a predefined tuple, handling pre-alpha labels and other version suffixes. It safely imports Django within a try-except block, then checks the Django version to conditionally set a configuration variable. The logic is simple, with no dynamic code execution, untrusted input, or external system interactions. The code follows common practices in Python packaging and Django app configuration, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for version management and Django compatibility handling. All reports correctly identify its safe and straightforward nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting the benign and secure design. No modifications or concerns are warranted.",
