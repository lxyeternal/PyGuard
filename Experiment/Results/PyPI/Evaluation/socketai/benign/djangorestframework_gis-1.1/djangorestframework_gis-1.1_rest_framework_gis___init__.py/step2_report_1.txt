  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward version handler and conditional Django configuration setter.\n- No report indicates any suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code.\n- The code snippets are standard practices in Python packaging and Django compatibility handling.\n- The \"malware\" scores are all 0, aligning with the analysis that no malicious activity is present.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are also 0, which seems appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- The \"obfuscated\" scores are 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Confirmations and logical assessments:**\n- The code's logic for version string construction is correct and standard.\n- The conditional import of Django with try-except is safe and common.\n- The check for Django version < 3.2 and setting `default_app_config` is typical for compatibility.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- All reports agree on the benign nature, and their assessments seem reasonable.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the code's analysis.\n- No claims are made based on assumptions; all conclusions are justified.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n- The code is a typical version and configuration handler with no malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned by all reports are appropriate and justified.\n- No modifications are necessary; the analysis aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. The scores reflect the benign nature of the code. No further action or concern is warranted.",
