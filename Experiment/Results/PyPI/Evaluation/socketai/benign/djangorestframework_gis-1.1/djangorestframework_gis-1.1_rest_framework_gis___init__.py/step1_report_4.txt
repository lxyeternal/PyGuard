  "purpose": "Defines version information and provides a function to retrieve formatted version string, also conditionally sets a Django app configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads the VERSION tuple, imports django module if available",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data output or external system interaction",
  "flows": "Version tuple is formatted into a string, optional import influences configuration based on django.VERSION",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version formatting and optional import with conditional assignment",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version tuple and provides a get_version() function to format this tuple into a human-readable version string, including pre-release labels. It also attempts to import Django and, if successful, checks the Django version to conditionally assign a configuration string. The import is guarded with try-except to avoid errors if Django isn't installed. There are no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no external system interactions. The code appears to be standard version handling and conditional configuration logic typical of Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard version formatting and optional Django configuration based on the Django version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks present.",
