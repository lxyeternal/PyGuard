  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the validity of their conclusions and scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is straightforward: defines a version tuple, a function to format it, and a conditional import for Django to set a configuration variable.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The import of Django is guarded with try-except, which is standard practice.\n- The version string construction is simple and based solely on the tuple.\n- No untrusted input, data leaks, or suspicious sinks are present.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as standard version handling and conditional configuration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct, the code is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is straightforward and safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct, standard version and configuration handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No issues.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identified no malware, and the code does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the simplicity and safety, all scores should be 0 or very close to it.\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, standard version handling, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.",
