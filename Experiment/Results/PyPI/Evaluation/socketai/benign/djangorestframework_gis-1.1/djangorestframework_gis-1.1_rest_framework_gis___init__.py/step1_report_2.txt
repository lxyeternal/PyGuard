{
  "purpose": "Define and retrieve package version information, and conditionally set a Django app configuration based on Django version.",
  "sources": "Reading the VERSION tuple, accessing __version__, reading Django's VERSION if imported.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to or process untrusted input directly; no sink indicates data leak or security breach.",
  "flows": "The get_version() function processes the VERSION tuple to produce a version string; the try-except block conditionally sets a variable based on Django version.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The version string logic is standard. The import check is safe.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages version info and conditionally configures a Django app. No external input or untrusted data flows into security-critical sinks. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, handling version information and Django compatibility logic with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
