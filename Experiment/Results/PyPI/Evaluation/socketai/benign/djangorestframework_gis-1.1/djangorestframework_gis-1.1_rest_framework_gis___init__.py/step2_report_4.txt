  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The code defines a version tuple and a get_version() function that constructs a version string, with handling for pre-alpha labels.\n- It conditionally sets `default_app_config` if Django is installed and its version is below 3.2.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is observed.\n- The logic is straightforward, and the source and sink are benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This aligns well with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on version handling and conditional Django configuration.\n- No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.\n- The code is standard for version management.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, similar structure: version string creation, optional Django import, conditional configuration.\n- No suspicious behavior or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: version tuple, get_version(), conditional Django import and configuration.\n- No anomalies or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar version and configuration logic.\n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe straightforward, standard version handling and optional Django configuration.\n- **Malware suspicion:** None of the reports identify or imply malicious code. The code does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or data leaks.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and readable; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All are correctly set to 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The malware scores should remain at 0 for all reports.\n- Obfuscated scores should stay at 0.\n- Security risk scores are correctly at 0.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. The code is a standard version and configuration handler with no malicious or obfuscated behavior.",
