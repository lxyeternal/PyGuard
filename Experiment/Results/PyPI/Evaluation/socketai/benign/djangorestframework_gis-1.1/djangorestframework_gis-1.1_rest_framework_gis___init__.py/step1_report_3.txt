  "purpose": "Define and retrieve the version string of the package, and conditionally set a Django app configuration based on Django version.",
  "sources": "Reading VERSION tuple, importing django module",
  "sinks": "Returning version string, setting default_app_config variable",
  "flows": "get_version() constructs version string from VERSION tuple; import django influences setting of default_app_config",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors; simple version handling and optional Django import",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version tuple and constructs a version string with optional pre-release labels. It conditionally sets a Django app configuration if Django is installed and version is below 3.2. No malicious or suspicious code behavior detected. No external data inputs, untrusted data, or security-critical operations are present. The code appears to be straightforward version and configuration logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version management and configuration setup with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
