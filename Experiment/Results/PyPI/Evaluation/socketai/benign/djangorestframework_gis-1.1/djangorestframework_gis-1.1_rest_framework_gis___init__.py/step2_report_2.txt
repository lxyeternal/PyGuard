  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is straightforward: defines a version tuple, a function to generate a version string, and a conditional import for Django to set a configuration variable.\n- No dynamic code execution, no untrusted input, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns are present.\n- The import of Django is guarded with try-except, which is standard practice.\n- The version string logic is typical and correct.\n- The setting of `default_app_config` based on Django version is standard for Django apps.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears correct and consistent. The version string is generated properly, and the conditional Django import and version check are safe.\n- **Malicious code or backdoors:** None detected.\n- **Data leaks or external system interactions:** None.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent.\n\n### Evaluation of each report:\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n- **Purpose:** Version handling and conditional Django config.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious intent, straightforward.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - securityRisk: 0 (correct)  \n  - confidence: 1 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Fully accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, version info and Django config.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No issues or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0  \n  - confidence: 1\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n- Same as above, straightforward version and Django version check.\n- **Scores:** All zeroes except confidence at 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n- Same reasoning applies.\n- **Scores:** Zeroes across malware, obfuscated, securityRisk, confidence at 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n- Same as others, standard version and conditional configuration.\n- **Scores:** All zeroes except confidence at 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** All are 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1 in all cases, justified by the straightforward, standard code.\n\n---\n\n### Final thoughts:\n\n- The code is a typical versioning and configuration pattern used in Python packages.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. No modifications are necessary. The overall security assessment should remain at zero risk, with high confidence.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code is a standard, safe pattern for version handling and conditional Django configuration. No malicious or suspicious activity is present.",
