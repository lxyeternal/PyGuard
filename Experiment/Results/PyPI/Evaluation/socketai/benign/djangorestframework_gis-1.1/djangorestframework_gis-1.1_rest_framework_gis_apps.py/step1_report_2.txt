{
  "purpose": "This code customizes the Django Rest Framework serializer mappings for GeoDjango geometry fields, enabling proper serialization of geographic data types.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.contrib.gis.db, rest_framework.serializers, and local fields; internal class attributes; possibly user-defined GeometryField.",
  "sinks": "None identified that process untrusted input or lead to data leakage or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Code updates the _field_mapping or serializer_field_mapping with geometry-related field classes, but does not handle external input or execute untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs observed. The code is straightforward configuration logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an AppConfig subclass that, during the Django app initialization, updates the serializer field mappings for various GeoDjango geometry fields to custom GeometryField. It safely accesses internal serializer attributes with a try-except block, ensuring compatibility across DRF versions. The purpose is to correctly serialize geographic data types, with no external input handling, security-sensitive operations, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration module for Django REST Framework with GeoDjango; it performs no malicious actions, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious behavior. It simply maps geometry fields to a custom serializer. No malware or security risks are evident.",
