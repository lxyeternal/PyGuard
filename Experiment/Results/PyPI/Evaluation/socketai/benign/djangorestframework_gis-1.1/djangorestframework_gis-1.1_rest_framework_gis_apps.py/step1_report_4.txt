  "purpose": "Configure and update Django Rest Framework serializer mappings for GeoDjango spatial fields.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.contrib.gis.db and rest_framework.serializers; access to ModelSerializer's internal mapping.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies ModelSerializer's internal field mapping, which could affect data serialization but not directly lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Imports models and serializer, attempts to access and update the internal field mapping, mapping GeoDjango fields to a custom GeometryField.",
  "anomalies": "Accesses internal attributes of ModelSerializer, which could change in future versions, but no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose is to modify the internal field mapping of Django Rest Framework's ModelSerializer to associate various GeoDjango spatial fields with a custom GeometryField for proper serialization. It attempts to handle different DRF versions by trying two different attribute paths. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or obfuscated code. The code performs a standard configuration task within a Django application. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical configuration snippet for a Django project that integrates GeoDjango with Django Rest Framework. It modifies internal serializer mappings to support geographic fields. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
