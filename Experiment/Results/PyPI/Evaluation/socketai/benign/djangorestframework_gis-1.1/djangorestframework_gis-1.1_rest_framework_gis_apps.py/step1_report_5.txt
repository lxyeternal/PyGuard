{
  "purpose": "This code configures a Django app to map GeoDjango spatial fields to a custom serializer field for the Django REST Framework GIS extension.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules from Django (django.apps, django.contrib.gis.db), rest_framework.serializers, and internal modules (.fields). It reads from the ModelSerializer's _field_mapping or serializer_field_mapping attributes.",
  "sinks": "The code updates the field_mapping dictionary, which is used for serializing spatial fields. No external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads the serializer's field mapping attributes (sources), then updates the mapping with custom geometry fields (sink), affecting how spatial data is serialized.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present. The try-except structure handles differences across DRF versions but is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass that, upon application readiness, updates the serializer field mappings for geographic fields. It imports necessary modules, handles version differences in DRF, and extends the serializer mapping with custom geometry fields. All operations are within normal configuration scope. No external data inputs, user input processing, or insecure patterns are evident. The logic is straightforward and intended for proper serialization of GIS fields.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration component for integrating GIS features with Django REST Framework serializers. It performs no malicious activity or suspicious behavior, focusing solely on mapping serializer fields for geographic data. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
