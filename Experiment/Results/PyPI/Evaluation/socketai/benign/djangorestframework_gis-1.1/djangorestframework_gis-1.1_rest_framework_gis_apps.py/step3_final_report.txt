  "purpose": "Configure Django REST Framework serializers to map GIS model fields to a custom GeometryField serializer for proper geographic data serialization.",
  "sources": "Internal serializer attributes (_field_mapping or serializer_field_mapping), imported GIS model fields, and version-dependent serializer classes.",
  "sinks": "Updates to internal serializer field mapping dictionaries; no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "flows": "Static assignment updating internal serializer mappings during app initialization; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django AppConfig subclass that, upon app startup, updates internal serializer mappings to associate GIS model fields with a custom GeometryField serializer. It handles different DRF versions via try-except blocks. There is no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The modifications are confined to internal mappings, serving a configuration purpose. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's intent is to enable correct serialization of geographic data types within Django REST Framework with GeoDjango support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet for integrating GIS support into Django REST Framework serializers. It does not contain malicious behavior, security vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, security risk score is 0, and obfuscated score is 0, reflecting its safe and standard nature.",
