  "purpose": "Configure and update Django Rest Framework serializer mappings for GeoDjango spatial fields.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.contrib.gis.db and rest_framework.serializers, local import from .fields.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; mainly configuration and class attribute updates.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this code sets static mappings and class configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic code, no obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django AppConfig subclass that customizes serializer mappings for geographic fields. It imports necessary Django GIS modules and rest_framework serializers, then updates the serializer field mapping to include custom GeometryField for various geometry types. Exception handling distinguishes between DRF versions. There are no external input sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The code's structure is straightforward and intended for configuration purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical configuration module for Django REST Framework GIS support with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
