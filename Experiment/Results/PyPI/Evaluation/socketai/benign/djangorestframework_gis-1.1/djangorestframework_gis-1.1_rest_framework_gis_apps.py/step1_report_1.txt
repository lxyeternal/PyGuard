{
  "purpose": "The code modifies Django REST Framework serializer mappings to associate GIS model fields with a custom GeometryField serializer.",
  "sources": "The code reads from 'ModelSerializer._field_mapping' or 'ModelSerializer.serializer_field_mapping' to update serializer field mappings.",
  "sinks": "The code updates internal serializer mappings; no external sinks or untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "Source (serializer field mappings) is updated with GeometryField for various GIS model fields; no external data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code primarily updates internal mappings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Django GIS and REST Framework modules, then attempts to access and update serializer field mappings depending on DRF version. It maps various GIS model fields to a custom GeometryField for serialization purposes. There are no inputs from external sources, no data leaks, and no execution of untrusted code. The logic appears straightforward and intended for serializer configuration. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration adjustment for Django REST Framework GIS integration. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The purpose is to ensure proper serializer field mappings, and it operates within expected patterns without suspicious anomalies.",
