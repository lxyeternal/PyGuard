  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a comment-only placeholder or template for user customization.\n- No executable code, data processing, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk score is also 0, which aligns with the absence of executable or malicious content.\n- The confidence score is 1, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The original code is just comments and documentation; no issues are present.\n- The reports correctly identify that there are no data flows, sources, sinks, or anomalies.\n- The reasoning that the code poses no security threat is sound.\n\n**Potential issues or points of critique:**\n- Since the code is purely comments, assigning any malware or obfuscated scores greater than 0 would be unreasonable.\n- The reasoning is consistent across all reports, and the scores reflect the actual content.\n\n**Suggestions for score adjustments:**\n- No adjustments needed; the scores are appropriate.\n- The high confidence (1) is justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n- The reports' conclusions are accurate.\n- The scores align with the content.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation, just comments)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the nature of the code as purely documentation and placeholders. No security concerns are present, and the scores are appropriate.",
