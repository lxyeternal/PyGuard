  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is only comments/documentation with no executable code.\n- The scores assigned are consistently zero for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n- No anomalies, data flows, or suspicious patterns are present in any report.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**1. Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Placeholder init file for custom distribution code.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly states that the code is only comments, no executable logic, no malicious content.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n**2. Report 2**\n- Same reasoning as above, emphasizing that it’s purely documentation.\n- **Scores:** all zero, appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**3. Report 3**\n- Same conclusion, emphasizing the absence of code or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** all zero, appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**4. Report 4**\n- Same reasoning, confirming no executable code or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** all zero, appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**5. Report 5**\n- Same as others, just comments for user customization.\n- **Scores:** all zero, appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** No executable code, no data handling, no network activity.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not applicable; code is plain comments.\n- **Security risk:** None.\n\n**The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are entirely justified.**\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are consistent and correctly interpret the code as a benign, documentation-only placeholder.\n- No changes needed to the scores or reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat.",
