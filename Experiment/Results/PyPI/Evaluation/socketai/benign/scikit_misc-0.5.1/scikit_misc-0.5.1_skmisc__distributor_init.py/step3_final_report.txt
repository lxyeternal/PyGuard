  "purpose": "Placeholder init file for custom distribution support in scikit-misc, intended for user modifications such as hardware checks.",
  "sources": "Comments and documentation within the file; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code contains only comments and no executable or data processing code.",
  "flows": "No data flows; as there are no executable statements, no source-to-sink paths exist.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, or suspicious patterns; only comments and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely comments serving as a template or placeholder for user customization. No executable logic, data processing, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence score of 1 reflects certainty given the straightforward, comment-only content. No anomalies or security concerns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, consisting solely of comments for user customization. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports accurately assess the code as benign, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
