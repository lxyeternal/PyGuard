{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to retrieve the version of the 'scikit_misc' package, import a configuration show function, and define a test function to run pytest-based tests.",
  "sources": "Reading package version using importlib.metadata.version, importing show from skmisc.__config__, and importing pytest.",
  "sinks": "None of the sources directly lead to untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or sensitive data exposure points are present.",
  "flows": "Version retrieval flow from importlib.metadata to __version__; import flow from skmisc.__config__ to show_config; test function flow from import to pytest execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a comment suggesting it should not be run in the source directory, which may indicate a concern about development environment exposure. The test function imports pytest dynamically, which is standard, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code handles package version retrieval safely, catching PackageNotFoundError. It conditionally imports a configuration show function, raising an ImportError with a clear message if it fails, indicating an environment check. The test function dynamically imports pytest and runs tests with arguments, which is typical for test scripts. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. No external network connections, data leaks, or malicious actions are evident. Overall, the code performs standard package management and testing routines with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization and testing script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It includes environment checks and test execution functions typical for development and testing environments.",
