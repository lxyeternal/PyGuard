  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- Retrieves the version of 'scikit_misc' via `importlib.metadata.version`, handling `PackageNotFoundError`.\n- Deletes the imported `version` and `PackageNotFoundError` after use.\n- Conditionally imports `show` from `skmisc.__config__`, raising an informative `ImportError` if it fails.\n- Defines a `test()` function that runs pytest on the current directory, optionally with additional args and plugins.\n- Uses dynamic code execution (`pytest.main()`), which is typical for test utilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Concerns:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code?**  \n  No. The code performs standard package management and testing routines. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n\n- **Error handling:**  \n  Properly handles missing packages and import errors with informative messages.\n\n- **Dynamic execution:**  \n  The `pytest.main()` invocation is typical for test scripts; no malicious intent is implied.\n\n- **Use of `del` statements:**  \n  Unusual but benign; they clean up namespace, not malicious.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  The only point of concern could be the `args` passed to `pytest.main()`. If externally influenced, this could cause arbitrary test execution, but this is standard in test runners and not malicious.\n\n- **Malware or obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk | Justification |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|--------------|\n| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0.1 | Standard package info and test runner; no malicious code. Slight risk due to dynamic test execution, but typical. |\n| 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Similar to #1, no malicious behavior. |\n| 3 | 0 | 0 | 0.2 | Slightly higher due to potential external influence on `args`, but still benign. |\n| 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Standard utility code, no malicious activity. |\n| 5 | 0 | 0 | 0.1 | Same as above, standard package management and testing code. |\n\n**All reports** indicate no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The highest risk score is around 0.2, which is low.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1-0.2** — minimal, mainly due to dynamic test execution, which is standard in test scripts.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign utility module for package version management, configuration display, and testing. No supply chain security issues are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nWhile the code could be misused if external inputs to `args` are malicious, this pattern is typical for test runners and not inherently dangerous. Proper validation of external inputs can mitigate this concern, but it's outside the scope of this static review.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain current scores: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0.1-0.2**. The code is safe and typical for its purpose.",
