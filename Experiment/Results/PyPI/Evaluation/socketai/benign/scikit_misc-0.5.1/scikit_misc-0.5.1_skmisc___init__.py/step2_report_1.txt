  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code retrieves package version, conditionally imports a config display function, and defines a test runner. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Analysis:** The dynamic execution of pytest.main() could be misused if test code is malicious, but no such evidence here. The error message is informative, and no secrets or malicious patterns are present.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard package utility code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on environment checks and standard testing routines.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; the code handles import errors gracefully.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; standard code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—package version retrieval, optional import, test function with pytest.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Analysis:** The only slight concern is passing external args to pytest, which could be manipulated, but this is typical for test scripts.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar functions—package version, config import, test runner.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; standard testing utility.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same core functionality—package version, import handling, pytest-based testing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; potential for misuse if args are externally controlled, but typical for test scripts.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity (score 0). The code is standard for package management and testing.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all reports; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly due to the dynamic execution of pytest.main() with user-provided args, which is common in testing scripts but could pose a risk if args are maliciously manipulated. However, no evidence suggests malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code performs routine package version retrieval, optional configuration display, and test execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The dynamic invocation of pytest is standard but should be used with caution if args are externally influenced—yet, this is typical for test utilities.\n- The use of `del` statements to remove imported functions is unusual but not malicious.\n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (benign)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, mainly due to test execution with external args, which is standard in testing code but warrants cautious use)\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n**Malware: 0**  \n**Obfuscated: 0**  \n**Risk: 0.1–0.2**\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analyses and the nature of the code as a benign utility module.",
