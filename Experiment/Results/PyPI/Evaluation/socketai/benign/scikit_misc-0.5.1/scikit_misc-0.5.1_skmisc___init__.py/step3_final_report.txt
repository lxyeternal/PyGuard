  "purpose": "Retrieve package version, optionally display configuration, and run tests using pytest.",
  "sources": "version('scikit_misc') call, import of show from skmisc.__config__, __file__ for path, external args for pytest.main()",
  "sinks": "pytest.main() execution with args, potential for executing arbitrary tests if args are manipulated",
  "flows": "version retrieval → optional import of show → test() function calling pytest.main() with args",
  "anomalies": "Use of del to remove imported functions, passing external args to pytest.main(), which could be manipulated externally",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package version retrieval, conditional import of a configuration display function, and defines a test runner invoking pytest. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of 'del' is unusual but benign. The dynamic execution of pytest.main() with external args is typical for test scripts but could be misused if args are maliciously controlled. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The risk mainly stems from the potential misuse of external inputs in test execution, which is common in testing utilities but warrants cautious use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for version management, configuration display, and testing. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The slight risk associated with external input in test args is typical for such scripts. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
