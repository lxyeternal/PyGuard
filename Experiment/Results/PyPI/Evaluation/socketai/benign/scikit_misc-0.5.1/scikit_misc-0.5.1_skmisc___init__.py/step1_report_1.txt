{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to retrieve the version of the 'scikit_misc' package, optionally import a configuration display function, and define a test runner function for the package.",
  "sources": "Reading package version via importlib.metadata.version, importing skmisc.__config__, and local file path for tests.",
  "sinks": "Potentially raising ImportError with detailed message, executing pytest.main() which may run test code.",
  "flows": "Version retrieval (source) to exception handling; import of show_config (source) to possible ImportError (sink); test() function from local file path to pytest.main() execution (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of del to remove imported functions, which is unnecessary but not malicious; the test() function dynamically executes pytest.main(), which may run arbitrary test code. Error message in import exception includes detailed instructions but no malicious content; no hardcoded secrets or credentials observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages package version information, conditional import of a configuration function, and running tests via pytest. No suspicious code or backdoors are present. The dynamic import of pytest and test execution is typical for test utilities but could be misused if the test code itself were malicious. The error handling is straightforward, and no obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present. Overall, the code appears benign with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard package version retrieval, conditional configuration import, and a test runner. No malicious behavior or backdoors are detected. The dynamic pytest execution could be misused if test code is malicious, but nothing indicates malicious intent here.",
