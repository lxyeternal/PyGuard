{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to retrieve the version of the 'scikit_misc' package, import a configuration display function, and define a test runner function for the package.",
  "sources": "Reading package version with importlib.metadata.version, importing show from skmisc.__config__, and importing pytest.",
  "sinks": "Potential for executing untrusted code via pytest.main, but only if pytest is installed; no other significant sinks detected.",
  "flows": "The version info is retrieved and stored; the show_config function is imported and appended to __all__; the test() function calls pytest.main with arguments based on the file path.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The exception handling for import errors is standard. The test function dynamically constructs arguments for pytest, which is typical for test runners.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily deals with package version retrieval, conditional import of a configuration display function, and defining a test function. It handles missing dependencies gracefully. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The test function uses pytest, a common testing framework, without executing any untrusted code directly. The use of del to delete imported functions is unusual but not malicious. Overall, the code appears legitimate and intended for package version management, configuration display, and testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard package management and testing functions with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The code is safe for use.",
