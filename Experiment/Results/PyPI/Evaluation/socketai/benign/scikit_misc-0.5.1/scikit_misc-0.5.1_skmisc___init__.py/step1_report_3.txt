{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to retrieve the version of the 'scikit_misc' package, handle import errors for 'skmisc.__config__', and define a test function for running pytest on the current package.",
  "sources": "Reading package version via importlib.metadata, importing show from skmisc.__config__, reading __file__ for current directory, importing pytest.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted input in 'args' passed to pytest.main (if externally influenced), and dynamic import errors that could be manipulated if package structure is compromised.",
  "flows": "Version retrieval from package metadata → error handling and cleanup → import of configuration module → execution of test function with arguments (possibly influenced externally).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The use of 'del' for cleanup is normal. The test function dynamically constructs arguments for pytest, which could be manipulated if 'args' or 'plugins' are externally controlled, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations: retrieving package version info, importing configuration, and defining a test runner. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. Error handling for import issues is straightforward. The test function appends the current directory to args for pytest, which is typical for running local tests. No malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage is evident in these operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate component for package version management, configuration display, and testing. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious code. The only consideration is ensuring that 'args' passed to pytest are not externally manipulated in an unsafe manner, but this is a standard pattern.",
