{
  "purpose": "The code provides a version string for the package, supporting versioning and source control.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ = \"0.5.1\") is the primary data source.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to assigning a static string to __version__, with no external data input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and does not contain hidden or unusual logic.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a static version string, which is common in Python packages for version management. It explicitly states not to edit manually and is generated by the build system, indicating standard package versioning practice. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. There are no input sources, external data handling, or runtime behaviors that could introduce security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple version assignment with no malicious intent or security risks. It is typical boilerplate code for package versioning and contains no indicators of malware or security issues.",
