  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`. The code is static, simple, and typical for package versioning. No dynamic code, no input/output, and no external interactions are present. Therefore, **no issues or malicious behaviors are detected**.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the code's purpose, its auto-generated nature, and the absence of suspicious activity. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware: 0  \n   - Obfuscated: 0  \n   - Security risk: 0  \n   - Confidence: 1  \n   \n   These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature. The high confidence score aligns with the clear, straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for any high risk scores:**  \n   Since the code is a static version string assignment with no dynamic or external elements, there's no justification for a risk score higher than 0. The malware score is correctly set to 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as auto-generated boilerplate with no suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   The scores are consistent and appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\nGiven the nature of the code, I agree with the assessments provided. There are no hidden behaviors, no obfuscation, and no malicious intent. The code is standard boilerplate for versioning.\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is benign, and the scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
