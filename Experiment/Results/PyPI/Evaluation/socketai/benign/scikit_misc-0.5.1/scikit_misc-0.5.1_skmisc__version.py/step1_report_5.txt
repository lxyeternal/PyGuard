  "purpose": "This code defines the version string for the package, supporting version control and build processes.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ from a string literal.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "None; simple assignment without external input or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard version declaration with a comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard versioning comment and variable assignment. It explicitly states not to edit the file manually and assigns a version string to __version__, a common practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. No input/output or data processing occurs beyond the version string assignment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves only to specify the package version. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements.",
