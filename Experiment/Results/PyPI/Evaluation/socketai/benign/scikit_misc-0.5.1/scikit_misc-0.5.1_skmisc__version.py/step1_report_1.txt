{
  "purpose": "The code sets a version string for the package, likely used for version control and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ variable from a string literal.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "None; the code simply assigns a static string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "The comment suggests this file is auto-generated, which is common and not suspicious. No dynamic code, secrets, or unusual constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a comment and a straightforward assignment of a version string to __version__. It is a typical pattern in Python packages for versioning. No input sources, no data flow, and no suspicious behavior are present. The file is likely auto-generated for version management, and there are no indications of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a metadata placeholder for versioning purposes. It does not contain malware, security risks, or obfuscation. No malicious behavior is detected.",
