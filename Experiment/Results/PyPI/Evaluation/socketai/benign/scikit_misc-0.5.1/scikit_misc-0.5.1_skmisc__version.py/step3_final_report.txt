  "purpose": "Assigns a static version string for package versioning, auto-generated by build system.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, input handling, or suspicious constructs; comments indicate auto-generation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string (__version__ = \"0.5.1\"). It contains only comments about auto-generation and explicitly states not to edit manually. No dynamic behavior, external data, or malicious code is present. The code is typical boilerplate for versioning in Python packages. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assign zero malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores, and confidence of 1. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and auto-generated for versioning purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current assessments and scores are appropriate and require no modifications.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
