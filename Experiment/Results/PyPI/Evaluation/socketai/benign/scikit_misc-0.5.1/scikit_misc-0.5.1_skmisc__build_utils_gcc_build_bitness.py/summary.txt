  "conclusion": "The script is a simple, benign utility for detecting system architecture via gcc. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scoring of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1) is appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
