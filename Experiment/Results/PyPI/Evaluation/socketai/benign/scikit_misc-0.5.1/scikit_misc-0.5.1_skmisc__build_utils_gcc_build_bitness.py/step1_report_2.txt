  "purpose": "Detect the bitness (32 or 64) of a Mingw-w64 gcc build target on Windows.",
  "sources": "Executes 'gcc -v' command to get version and target info from subprocess output.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.run to execute external gcc command; no direct data sinks for untrusted input within this code.",
  "flows": "Runs 'gcc -v', captures stderr, extracts target architecture info, and prints '32' or '64'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Uses regex on subprocess output, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code runs an external compiler command, captures its output, and parses the target architecture information. The subprocess call is straightforward and does not handle untrusted data inputs or user-controlled inputs. The code raises an exception if the target is unrecognized, but this is standard error handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed. It is a utility script intended for environment detection.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign utility for environment detection with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
