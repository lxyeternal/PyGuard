{
  "purpose": "Detect the bitness (32 or 64) of Mingw-w64 gcc build target on Windows.",
  "sources": "Subprocess call to 'gcc -v' which retrieves compiler version and target info.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess output is parsed, but no direct sink for untrusted data leading to data leaks or malicious actions is present.",
  "flows": "Run 'gcc -v' -> Capture stderr -> Regex search for target -> Output bitness based on target prefix.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs straightforward system info retrieval. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The script runs a subprocess to execute 'gcc -v' and captures its output. It then extracts the target architecture info from stderr using regex. Based on the target prefix ('i686' or 'x86_64'), it prints the bitness. The flow is simple and standard for system info gathering. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code does not perform network communication, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for detecting the system's compiler bitness. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It is a straightforward script with no security risks identified.",
