  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a standard Sphinx configuration file (`conf.py`) for the `scikit-misc` project.\n- They emphasize that the code:\n  - Imports standard modules (`os`, `sys`, `skmisc`, and conditionally `mock`)\n  - Uses environment variables (`READTHEDOCS`) to modify behavior\n  - Sets up documentation options, extensions, paths, and themes\n  - Does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle sensitive data\n  - Contains no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs\n  - Uses typical patterns for documentation setup, including conditional mocking for ReadTheDocs environments\n\n**Security and Malware Assessment:**\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected. The code is purely configuration-oriented.\n- **Use of environment variables:** Only influences conditional imports and path modifications; no untrusted data flows into critical operations.\n- **External modules:** The only external dependency is `skmisc`, which is expected for documentation versioning. The optional `mock` module is used in a standard way.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No evidence of code injection, remote code execution, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or techniques.\n- **Backdoors or secret keys:** None present.\n- **Malware score:** Zero across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious activity or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, readable configuration code.\n- **Risk:** 0 — No security risks identified; standard configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration file with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, safe Sphinx configuration script for documentation. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present. The scores should all be zero, reflecting its benign nature.",
