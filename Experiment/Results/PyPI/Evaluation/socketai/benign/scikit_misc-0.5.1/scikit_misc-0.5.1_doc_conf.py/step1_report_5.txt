  "purpose": "Configuration file for building documentation using Sphinx for the 'scikit-misc' project.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('READTHEDOCS'), os and sys modules, skmisc module import.",
  "sinks": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; no network, file, or system command executions are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'READTHEDOCS' influences conditional imports; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors; the code strictly configures documentation build settings without performing any runtime or system modification tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script with environment checks and path modifications. It conditionally imports mock modules based on environment variables but does not execute external commands or handle sensitive data. No malicious or suspicious code patterns, such as network calls, credential handling, or obfuscation, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical documentation configuration script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages documentation build settings and environment configurations.",
