  "purpose": "Configuration file for building the documentation of the scikit-misc project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (READTHEDOCS), importing skmisc, standard library modules (os, sys).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data being sent over network, no file modifications, or sensitive data usage observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variable READTHEDOCS influences import logic; no flow of untrusted data to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code primarily manages documentation build configurations.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration with environment-based module mocking, extension settings, and output configurations. It imports standard modules safely, uses environment variables appropriately, and does not execute any untrusted code or include dynamic code execution. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or malicious intent are observed. All operations are related to setting up documentation build parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script for documentation generation with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It manages environment variables, imports, and documentation options securely and transparently.",
