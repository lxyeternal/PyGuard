{
  "purpose": "Retrieve version information for a package using Git SCM or a version file",
  "sources": "run() executes shell commands; run() called with 'git' commands; reading _version.py file",
  "sinks": "run() executes system commands that could potentially execute arbitrary code if manipulated; reading files is generally safe",
  "flows": "User input could potentially influence commands run via run() if externally influenced, but in this code, commands are hardcoded; file reading is static",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic execution of untrusted input; no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns; use of regex is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The script primarily executes git commands to retrieve version info or reads from a static file. The commands are predefined and not constructed from external input, reducing risk. The run() function safely handles command execution with shlex.split for POSIX systems, preventing command injection. The overall code appears to be a standard version retrieval utility with no malicious intent. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or privilege escalation mechanisms are present. The code’s structure and behavior are consistent with legitimate version management functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version retrieval utility that does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It uses standard practices to execute predefined shell commands and read a version file. No security risks or malicious intent are evident.",
