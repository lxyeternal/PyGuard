{
  "purpose": "The script copies a specific file from a build directory to a distribution directory based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'MESON_DIST_ROOT' and 'MESON_BUILD_ROOT'; file path 'skmisc/_version.py' in the build directory",
  "sinks": "shutil.copy function that copies the file from source to destination",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables -> constructs source and destination paths -> copies file if it exists",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; straightforward file copy operation",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves directory paths from environment variables, constructs source and destination paths, and copies a file if it exists. The environment variables are used to determine source and target directories, which could be manipulated externally but are typical in build scripts. The copy operation itself is standard. There are no obfuscated elements, malicious network activity, or suspicious logic. The code is simple and appears to serve a benign purpose related to build or distribution processes.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard build utility for copying a version file from build to distribution directory, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
