  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The script copies a specific file (`skmisc/_version.py`) from a build directory to a distribution directory.\n- It relies on environment variables `MESON_DIST_ROOT` and `MESON_BUILD_ROOT`.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic.\n- The only potential concern is reliance on environment variables without validation, which is typical in build scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code performs the intended file copy operation correctly.\n- No issues are present in the code itself; the logic is sound.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident. The report's reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- The environment variables are unvalidated, but this is standard in build scripts and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no malicious behavior is observed.\n- **Security Risk:** Given the simplicity and benign nature, a low score (around 0.1 to 0.2) is appropriate, acknowledging the reliance on environment variables without validation.\n\n### Specific Comments:\n- The reports correctly identify the purpose and flow.\n- They all agree that the script is benign and standard.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1.0), which is justified.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- No changes needed; the assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Systematic Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (standard build script, minimal risk, reliance on environment variables)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low risk, standard build operation, no malicious intent)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, straightforward build utility copying a version file. The reports' scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
