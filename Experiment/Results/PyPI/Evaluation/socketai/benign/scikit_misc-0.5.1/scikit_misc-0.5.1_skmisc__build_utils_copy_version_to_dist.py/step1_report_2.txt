{
  "purpose": "The script copies a specific version file from the build directory to the distribution directory, likely as part of a build or deployment process.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'MESON_DIST_ROOT' and 'MESON_BUILD_ROOT' used to determine source and destination directories.",
  "sinks": "shutil.copy() function copies files from source to destination, potentially overwriting files if paths are manipulated.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables for directory paths -> constructs source and destination paths -> copies file if it exists.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no unusual behaviors. Use of environment variables is standard but depends on external setup.",
  "analysis": "The code reads two environment variables to determine source and destination directories. It then constructs file paths based on a relative path input and copies the file if it exists. The function is straightforward, with no signs of malicious logic or backdoors. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden network activity. The use of environment variables is common for build scripts, and the file copying process is standard.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign build utility that copies a version file from the build directory to the distribution directory. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code.",
