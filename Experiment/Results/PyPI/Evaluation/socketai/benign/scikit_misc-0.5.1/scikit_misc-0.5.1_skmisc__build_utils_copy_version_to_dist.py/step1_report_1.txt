{
  "purpose": "The script copies a specific file from a build directory to a distribution directory, likely as part of a build or packaging process.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'MESON_DIST_ROOT' and 'MESON_BUILD_ROOT' which specify the source and destination directories.",
  "sinks": "The shutil.copy function that copies files from source to destination based on paths constructed from environment variables.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables -> constructs source and destination paths -> checks if source exists -> copies file to destination if it exists.",
  "anomalies": "Relies on environment variables without validation, which could be manipulated, but no suspicious or malicious code is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves directory paths from environment variables, constructs file paths, and copies a specific file if it exists. It appears straightforward and intended for packaging. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior identified. Potential concern is dependency on external environment variables, but this is standard practice in build scripts. No suspicious or malicious actions detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard build utility script that copies a file based on environment variables. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
