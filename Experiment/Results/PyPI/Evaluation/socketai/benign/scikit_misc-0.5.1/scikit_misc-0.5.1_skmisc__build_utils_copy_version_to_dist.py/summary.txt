  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard build utility that copies a version file during packaging. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The reliance on environment variables is typical and does not constitute a threat in controlled environments. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and can remain as is."
