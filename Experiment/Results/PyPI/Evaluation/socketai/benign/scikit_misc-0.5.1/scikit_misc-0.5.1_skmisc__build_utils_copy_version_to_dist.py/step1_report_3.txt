{
  "purpose": "The script copies a specific version file from the build directory to the distribution directory, likely as part of a packaging or deployment process.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'MESON_DIST_ROOT' and 'MESON_BUILD_ROOT', and the relative path 'skmisc/_version.py' used in the copy operation.",
  "sinks": "The shutil.copy() function which writes a file to a destination path based on the source path and environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables provide directory paths; these paths are combined with the relative filename to locate source and destination files; the file is copied from source to destination.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior observed. The code performs straightforward file copying based on environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves two environment variables to determine source and destination directories. It defines a function to copy a specific file from build to distribution directory if it exists. The script runs this function with a fixed relative path. No user input processing, no network activity, and no suspicious code patterns are present. The operations are standard for build or packaging scripts, with no evident malicious intent or malicious code inclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate build utility script that copies a version file between directories. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues within this code segment.",
