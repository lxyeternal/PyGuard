  "purpose": "Copy a specific version file from the build directory to the distribution directory during build or packaging.",
  "sources": "Environment variables MESON_DIST_ROOT and MESON_BUILD_ROOT used to determine source and destination directories.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (shutil.copy) copying files based on environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Path objects (src and dest) -> shutil.copy if src exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward file copy operation. Reliance on environment variables without validation, but standard in build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables to determine source and destination directories, then copies a specific file if it exists. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present. The reliance on environment variables without validation is typical in build scripts but could be a minor concern if environment variables are manipulated maliciously. The code is simple, clear, and performs a benign operation. No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious logic are detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: ~0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard build utility that copies a version file during packaging. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The reliance on environment variables is typical and does not constitute a threat in controlled environments. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and can remain as is.",
