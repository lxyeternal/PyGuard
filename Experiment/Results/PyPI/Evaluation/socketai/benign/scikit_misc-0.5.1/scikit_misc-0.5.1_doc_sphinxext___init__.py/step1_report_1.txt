{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python module that performs some data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be determined without more context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external files or network requests if present.",
  "sinks": "Data could be written to files, sent over network connections, or logged; specific sinks are not clearly evident due to lack of full code context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or function arguments through processing functions and potentially to output sinks such as files or network sockets.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or malicious code snippets detected. The code structure and variable naming appear standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated sections observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard use of Python features. No suspicious imports or unusual patterns. Without further context, no signs of malicious behavior are evident. The absence of external network calls, obfuscated code, or secret handling suggests low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no clear indicators of malicious activity or security risks. The code appears to be a benign utility or processing module. Confidence is high that this is safe and not malicious.",
