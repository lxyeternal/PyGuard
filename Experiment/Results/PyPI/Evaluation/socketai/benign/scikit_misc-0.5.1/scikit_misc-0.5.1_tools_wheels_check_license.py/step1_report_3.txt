{
  "purpose": "The script checks for the presence and content of a LICENSE.txt file in a specified Python module directory, verifying it contains specific text indicative of a distribution license.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the command line argument for the module name, dynamically imports the specified module, and reads the LICENSE.txt file located in the module's directory.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to the console via print statements and terminates with sys.exit(), but does not write or send data elsewhere or execute external commands based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input: command line argument -> import module -> access module's __file__ attribute -> read LICENSE.txt file -> evaluate license text -> output result",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution beyond standard import. No suspicious network activity or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward license check by importing a module, locating its LICENSE.txt file, and verifying specific content in the file. The process relies on safe Python standard library functions and does not handle untrusted input beyond command line arguments, which are used solely for module selection. No external network calls, no execution of untrusted code, and no modifications to system or files besides reading the license file. The logic is transparent and appears solely for license verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for license verification that does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It neither leaks data nor performs any harmful actions. No signs of malware or malicious anomalies are detected.",
