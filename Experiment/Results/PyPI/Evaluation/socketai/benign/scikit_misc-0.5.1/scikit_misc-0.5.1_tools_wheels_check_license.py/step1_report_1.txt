  "purpose": "The script checks for the presence and content of a LICENSE.txt file in a specified Python module directory to verify license consistency.",
  "sources": "Reads module name argument from command line, imports the specified module, and reads the LICENSE.txt file from the module's directory.",
  "sinks": "Reads the LICENSE.txt file; outputs error messages if license content does not match expectations.",
  "flows": "Command line input -> import module -> access module's __file__ -> read LICENSE.txt -> check license text -> output result",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The script's logic is straightforward and intended for license verification.",
  "analysis": "The code takes an optional module name argument (default 'skmisc'), modifies sys.path, imports the module, then reads a LICENSE.txt file located in the module's directory. It checks whether the license text contains specific fragments indicating proper licensing. The process involves reading files and printing messages based on license verification. No suspicious code, external network calls, or data exfiltration activities are present. The logic is simple and aimed at license compliance, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a license check on a Python module by verifying the presence and content of LICENSE.txt. It does not contain malicious behavior or suspicious code. The purpose is legitimate, and there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
