{
  "purpose": "To verify the presence and content of a LICENSE.txt file within an installed module directory, ensuring it contains expected license text.",
  "sources": "sys.path.pop(0) (modifies sys.path), __import__(args.module) (imports specified module), open(license_txt) (reads LICENSE.txt file)",
  "sinks": "open(license_txt) (reads license file), sys.exit() (terminates script based on license check result)",
  "flows": "User provides module name -> module imported -> license file located in module directory -> license file read -> content checked -> script exits with success or error message",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.path.pop(0) to modify import path, dynamic import of user-specified module without validation, reading arbitrary license files based on module location, no input validation on module name",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically imports a module specified by the user, then locates a LICENSE.txt file in that module's directory, and verifies whether the license text contains specific expected strings. The dynamic import and file reading are controlled by user input but do not execute any code from the license file itself. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code simply performs a license check, which is a benign and standard practice. The use of sys.path.pop(0) appears intended to prevent the current directory from interfering with imports but does not introduce security risks. The script does not connect to network resources, handle sensitive data, or execute untrusted code beyond the import process. Overall, no malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign license verification script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs a straightforward check for license text within a module directory, using standard Python features. There are no backdoors, malware, or data leaks present.",
