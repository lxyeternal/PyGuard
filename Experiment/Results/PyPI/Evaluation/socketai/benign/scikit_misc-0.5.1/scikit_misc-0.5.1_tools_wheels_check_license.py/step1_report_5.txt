  "purpose": "The script checks for the presence and content of a LICENSE.txt file in a specified Python module's directory to verify compliance with distribution requirements.",
  "sources": "sys.path (modification), sys.modules (imported module), module's __file__ attribute, open() function reading LICENSE.txt",
  "sinks": "Reading LICENSE.txt file, printing error message to stdout, sys.exit() calls",
  "flows": "Import module -> access module file path -> locate LICENSE.txt -> read content -> check content -> output results",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; standard file handling and module inspection methods are used. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious functions present.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by parsing optional input for the module name, defaulting to 'skmisc'. It then removes the first element from sys.path to prevent interference. It imports the specified module, retrieves its __file__ attribute to locate its directory, and reads the LICENSE.txt file within that directory. It checks the content for specific license-related text. If the check fails, it outputs an error and the license text; otherwise, it exits successfully. All operations are straightforward, relying on standard Python modules and functions, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a license compliance checker for Python modules. It performs standard module inspection and file reading without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks in this code.",
