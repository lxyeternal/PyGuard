  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python library, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads package version via dynamic import (__import__(PACKAGE).__version__) and reads README.md if it exists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external commands; no network activity or malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads version and README content, then calls setup() with collected metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import for version can cause import errors if package is missing; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script following standard practices. It reads package metadata, including version, and prepares the package for distribution. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic import of the version is common but can be fragile if the package isn't installed in the environment during setup. No external data, network calls, or untrusted inputs are processed. The code's structure and content indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious activity or security issues. The minor risk associated with dynamic import is a known pattern and does not constitute malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the code's nature.",
