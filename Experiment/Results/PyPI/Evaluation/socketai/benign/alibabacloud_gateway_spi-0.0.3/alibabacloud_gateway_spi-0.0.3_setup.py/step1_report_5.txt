{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python SDK library for Alibaba Cloud Gateway SPI.",
  "sources": "Reads the version from the package's __version__ attribute and reads 'README.md' if it exists.",
  "targets": "No specific targets in the code that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations. No data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The version is imported from the package and used in the setup configuration; README content is read but not processed further.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Use of dynamic import to get version info is standard but could pose issues if the module has malicious code, though unlikely in this context.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py for packaging a Python library. It dynamically imports the package to get its version, which is a common practice. It reads the README file for long description. No external network calls, no data leaks, no code injection, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behaviors detected. The code relies on standard packaging libraries and functions, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and standard for Python package distribution. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code.",
