  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard setup.py script with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** No code injection, no external data handling, no malicious commands.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign. The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script; dynamic import of version is common but could cause import errors if package isn't available.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; the dynamic import is typical but could be problematic if the package isn't installed beforehand.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is accurate; no malicious behavior is suggested. The risk score is appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Typical packaging script; reads README and version; no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** No external data, network calls, or code injection.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup.py; no untrusted data processing.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard practices.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Typical setup script; dynamic import could pose issues if the package has malicious code, but unlikely.\n- **Analysis:** No network activity or malicious behavior; reliance on standard packaging practices.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score due to the dynamic import, but overall, no malicious activity is indicated.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable setup.py.\n- **Risk:** All are very low, with only one report assigning a small 0.1 due to the dynamic import, which is standard practice but could potentially cause issues if the package is malicious or missing.\n\n### My Final Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.05** — very low, mainly due to the dynamic import pattern which is common but slightly risky if the package is compromised.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign setup.py script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and align with the code's nature.",
