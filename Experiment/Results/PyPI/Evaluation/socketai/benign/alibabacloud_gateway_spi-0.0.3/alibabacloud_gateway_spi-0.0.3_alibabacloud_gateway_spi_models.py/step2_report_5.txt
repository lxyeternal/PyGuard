  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a set of data models for API request/response handling, with validation and serialization methods. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, justified by auto-generation comment)\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is boilerplate, standard data models with no signs of malicious activity. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on data models for request/response, validation, and serialization. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes the absence of malicious activity. The malware score remains appropriate at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines data models for API handling, with no dangerous operations. The presence of a credential client is typical SDK usage.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard data models with no malicious intent. Credential objects are typical SDK components.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The evaluation aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Data models and configuration classes, auto-generated, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is boilerplate data models.\n- **Use of credential object:** Standard for SDKs, not malicious.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Suspicious behaviors:** None. No network calls, file manipulations, or code execution.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate. The risk scores are low, justified by auto-generation comments and standard patterns.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is detected.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain low (~0.1), reflecting the boilerplate nature and auto-generated comments.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Justification:** The code is purely data models with validation and serialization functions, typical for SDKs, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The presence of credential objects is standard, and no dynamic or external code execution is present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed. The code is safe, legitimate SDK boilerplate, with no malware or obfuscation.",
