  "purpose": "Data models for API request and response handling, including validation and serialization.",
  "sources": "Input data via from_map methods, credential object as a class attribute, data passed to constructors.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flow from from_map inputs to class attributes, serialization in to_map methods.",
  "flows": "from_map inputs to class attributes, to_map outputs, validation checks on required fields.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data classes representing request, response, and configuration models with validation, serialization, and deserialization methods. No network calls, code injection, or malicious logic are present. The credential object is used as a type hint, which is standard in SDKs. The code is auto-generated, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The malware score is 0, as there is no evidence of malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, with straightforward class definitions. The risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern due to data handling but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, auto-generated SDK boilerplate for data modeling, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scoring is appropriate and consistent across all reports.",
