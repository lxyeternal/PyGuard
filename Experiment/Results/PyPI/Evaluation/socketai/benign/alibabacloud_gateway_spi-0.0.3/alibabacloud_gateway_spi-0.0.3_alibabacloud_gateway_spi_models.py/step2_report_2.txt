  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines data models for API request handling with validation and serialization. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Assessment:** The code is boilerplate, auto-generated, with no suspicious patterns. Validation methods only check required fields, no code execution or external calls.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, given the code's purpose.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment is accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Data models for managing request, response, and configuration, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Standard pattern, with no dangerous operations. Credential object is used as a type, not for malicious purposes.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, typical for SDK models.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct. No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Data models for API handling, with no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** No network calls, code injection, or dangerous operations. Credential object is a standard pattern.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1.\n\n**Conclusion:** The analysis is sound. No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines data models for SDK with no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** No external calls, no obfuscation, credential objects are standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid assessment. Safe code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Data models with no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No network or system calls, standard data handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is purely data modeling, auto-generated, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate. Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Mostly 0.1 or 0, which is reasonable given the context.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, auto-generated data models.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, typical for SDK boilerplate code.\n\n**Note:** There are no indications of hidden malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this code snippet. The presence of credential objects is standard in SDKs and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, standard SDK boilerplate, with no malware, obfuscation, or security issues.",
