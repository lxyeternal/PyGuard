{
  "purpose": "Define data models and validation methods for an interceptor context used in API request handling.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include constructor parameters, 'from_map' methods, and external API responses.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include 'to_map' methods that serialize data, and 'validate' methods that may process input data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through validation and mapping functions, with no evident untrusted data execution or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No obfuscated code detected. No hidden network calls, file modifications, or cryptominers.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data model classes with attributes, constructors, validation methods, and serialization/deserialization functions. All data handling appears standard, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious data flows. External libraries are used only for modeling and typing. Validation functions check required fields but do not execute code or access sensitive information. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of data model classes for API request/response handling, with no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or malware. It appears to be boilerplate code for API data structures without any harmful or suspicious behavior.",
