  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, serving as a version indicator in a Python package.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to or expose data to sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow; simple assignment with no input/output or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, minimal, and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal assignment of a version string to __version__, a common pattern in Python packages. No input sources, data flows, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is clear, un-obfuscated, and contains no malicious activity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious activity. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
