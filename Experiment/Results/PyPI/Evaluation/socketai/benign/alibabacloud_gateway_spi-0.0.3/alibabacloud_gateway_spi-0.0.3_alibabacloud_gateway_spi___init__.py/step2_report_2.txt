  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the original code:\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\n__version__ = \"0.0.3\"\n```\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Assigns a version string to a variable `__version__`.\n- No inputs, outputs, functions, or complex logic.\n- Typical pattern in Python packages for versioning.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports uniformly describe the code as a simple version string assignment.\n- They correctly identify that there are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious activity.\n- The conclusions are consistent: the code is benign, standard, and without malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a version string and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - `obfuscated`: 0 — correct, code is clear.\n  - `malware`: 0 — correct, no malicious activity.\n  - `securityRisk`: 0 — correct, no security issues.\n  - `confidence`: 1 — justified, the analysis is thorough and correct.\n\n- **Scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  No. All scores are 0 or 1, and in this context, 0 or 1 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Should be 0, as there is no indication of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated code:**  \n  Clearly not obfuscated; code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Zero, as the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The code is a standard version string assignment with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is benign.\n- No changes needed to the scores or analysis.\n- The reports are correct in their reasoning.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current assessment: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
