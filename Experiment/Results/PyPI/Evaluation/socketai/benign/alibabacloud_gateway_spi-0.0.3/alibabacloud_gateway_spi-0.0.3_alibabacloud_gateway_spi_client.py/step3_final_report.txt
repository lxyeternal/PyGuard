{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Client class with multiple unimplemented methods intended as an interface or stub for future extension, serving as part of an SDK or plugin system.",
  "sources": "The code imports models from 'alibabacloud_gateway_spi.models' and does not process external input or data.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data flows; the methods raise exceptions without handling input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; methods are placeholders raising exceptions, with no execution or data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "The code is auto-generated, contains only method signatures with 'Un-implemented' exceptions, and lacks any logic, data handling, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, auto-generated interface with no operational logic, data processing, or security-sensitive operations. It serves as a scaffold for future implementation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The methods do not process data or communicate externally, and the code structure is straightforward and clear.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, placeholder interface with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
