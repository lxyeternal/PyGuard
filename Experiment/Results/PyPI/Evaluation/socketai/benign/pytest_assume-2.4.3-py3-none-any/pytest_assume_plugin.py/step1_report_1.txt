{
  "purpose": "The code implements custom pytest hooks and a context manager for soft assertions, enabling detailed assumption tracking and reporting within pytest test runs.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the inspect.stack() call (stack frames and context), environment variables may be indirectly accessed through os.path (filename handling), and optional imports may load external modules. No explicit untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted strings for reporting purposes, logs assumption details, and raises exceptions with formatted messages. No data is written to external systems, files, or network sources.",
  "flows": "Input from inspect.stack() and context locals flows into formatted output strings for assumption success/failure reports. Exceptions are raised with formatted messages, but no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. Use of conditional imports and dynamic hooking appears standard for pytest plugin development. No unusual obfuscation, malicious network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a soft assertion mechanism using a context manager, hooking into pytest to track assumptions during tests. It manages assumption pass/fail states, logs detailed info including local variables on failure, and raises custom exceptions for test failures. No suspicious code or malicious behavior, such as network activity, system modifications, or hidden backdoors, is detected. Use of inspect, formatted output, and exception handling appears standard for test tooling. No indications of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a pytest extension for assumption handling, reporting, and failure management. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks, serving a benign purpose within testing workflows.",
