  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest extension for assumption management with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The initial high risk scores (0.9) are overestimations; a risk score around 0.1-0.2 is more accurate, reflecting minimal security concern primarily due to internal data handling."
