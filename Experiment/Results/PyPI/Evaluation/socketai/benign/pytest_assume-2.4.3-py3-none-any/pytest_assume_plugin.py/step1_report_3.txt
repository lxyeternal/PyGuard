{
  "purpose": "This code provides custom assumptions and hook implementations for pytest to facilitate soft assertions, assumption tracking, and reporting during testing.",
  "sources": "Reads from the inspect.stack() for call context, reads environment options via 'config.getoption', and accesses local variables within test frames.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'raise_' (from six) to re-raise exceptions; potential for exception manipulation but not malicious; no data leaks or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Sources (call stack, configuration options) flow into assumption handling and reporting functions; exceptions are caught and re-raised through 'raise_', with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, or backdoors; code structure is complex but appears consistent with test framework utilities; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines test assumption handling with context managers, hooks, and reporting functions for pytest. It reads call stack info and test frame locals to provide detailed failure reports. It manipulates exceptions for test reporting but does not perform any network activity, file system tampering, or data exfiltration. Use of 'raise_' is for exception reraising, not malicious. The code is focused solely on test diagnostics, with no signs of malicious intent. No suspicious code patterns or suspicious data handling were found.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate pytest utility module for managing assumptions, test result reporting, and hook integrations. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The complexity is consistent with test framework internals, with no signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malware.",
