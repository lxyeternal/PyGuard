  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Implements a pytest extension for assumption tracking, using inspect.stack() for call context, no external untrusted data sources.\n- **Sinks:** Reports assumption results, raises exceptions with formatted messages; no external communication.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Standard flow; no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; serves as a benign testing utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.9 — justified, as it's a test utility with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar pytest extension, reading test context via inspect.stack().\n- **Sinks:** Uses repr() and saferepr() for locals; no malicious sinks.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Standard; potential info leak if locals contain sensitive data, but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent; primarily for test diagnostics.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.9 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Assumption handling, reading call stack, config options, locals.\n- **Sinks:** Uses 'raise_' from six to re-raise exceptions; no external communication.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Standard exception manipulation; no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Utility for pytest testing; no malware or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.9 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar assumption management, dynamic hook imports, reading locals.\n- **Sinks:** Hook calls, exception handling; no external data leaks.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Use of internal pytest structures; environment manipulation possible but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical pytest plugin; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.9 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard pytest assumption extension, reading call stack, config.\n- **Sinks:** Reports, hook calls; no external data exfiltration.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Typical for pytest plugins; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign testing utility, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior. The code is primarily for soft assertions, assumption tracking, and reporting within pytest.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code uses standard patterns for testing plugins.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—test utility with internal hooks, exception handling, and no external communication—the risk score of 0.9 in each report seems high. However, since the code manipulates internal pytest structures and can leak local variables, a slightly lower but still cautious score (around 0.3–0.4) might be more appropriate.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.3 (due to internal data handling, but no external or malicious activity)\n\nThis code is a standard pytest extension for assumption handling, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The high risk scores appear to be overestimations considering the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.3   |\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further or review additional reports.",
