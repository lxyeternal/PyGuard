{
  "purpose": "The code provides placeholder hook functions for handling assumption pass/fail events and a summary report in a testing framework, likely pytest.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data outputs or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists, as the functions are empty and do not process data.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation, simply passing; no unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions intended as hooks for a testing framework, with docstrings explaining their purpose. All functions are empty and only use 'pass'. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The functions do not perform any operations, network activity, or data manipulation. This appears to be a scaffold or template for future implementation rather than malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of placeholder functions with no active logic or malicious intent. It does not exhibit any security risks or malicious behavior. It appears to be benign scaffolding for testing hooks.",
