{
  "purpose": "These functions appear to be hooks for a testing framework (likely pytest) to handle assumption failures, passes, and summary reports.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters: 'lineno', 'entry', and 'failed_assumptions'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "The code receives data through parameters and does not perform any data flow or manipulation; the functions are placeholders.",
  "anomalies": "All functions are empty pass statements; no actual code execution occurs, no suspicious operations or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists of stub functions intended for hook implementations in a testing framework. They do not perform any data processing, I/O, or system operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code structure is straightforward, and no obfuscation, code injection, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely boilerplate, placeholder hook functions for a testing framework with no operational or malicious code present. It does not pose any security threat or malicious intent.",
