{
  "purpose": "These functions are hooks for handling assumption results in pytest, a testing framework, to manipulate or report assumption outcomes.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read; the functions do not process input data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; functions do not perform any data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the functions only have placeholder 'pass' statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are observed. The code consists solely of function definitions with docstrings and no executable logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides stub functions intended for pytest hooks to handle assumption failures, successes, and reporting. All functions are empty with no internal logic, data processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities. The presence of these placeholders alone does not indicate malicious intent; they are likely intended for user customization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be boilerplate or template functions for pytest hooks without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or system modifications. Therefore, it poses no security concern.",
