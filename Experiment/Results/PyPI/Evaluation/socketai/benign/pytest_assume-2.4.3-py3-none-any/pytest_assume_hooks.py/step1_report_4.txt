{
  "purpose": "These functions serve as hooks for handling assumption failures, successes, and summaries within a testing framework, likely pytest.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it operates on internal parameters passed to the functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the functions do not process or output untrusted data or perform any data manipulation.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; all functions are placeholders without logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The functions are defined with descriptive docstrings but contain no executable code, logic, or data handling. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three placeholder functions intended as hooks for a testing framework. Each function accepts parameters related to assumption outcomes but does nothing with these parameters. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The structure and content are consistent with standard testing hook definitions. The lack of implementation indicates these are either stubs or templates.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning as placeholders for testing hooks with no actual logic or malicious content. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
