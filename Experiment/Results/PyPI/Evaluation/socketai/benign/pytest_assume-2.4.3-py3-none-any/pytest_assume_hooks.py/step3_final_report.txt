  "purpose": "Placeholder functions for pytest hooks to handle assumption failures, successes, and reporting.",
  "sources": "Function definitions and docstrings; no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "None; functions are empty with no internal logic or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of stub functions with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only empty functions with docstrings, serving as scaffolding for pytest hooks. There are no data processing, external interactions, or malicious patterns. The functions are placeholders intended for user implementation. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as scaffolding for pytest hooks with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing reports correctly identify this, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
