  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, considering the code's actual content and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- All functions are placeholders with no logic (`pass` statements).\n- They are intended as hooks for a testing framework (likely pytest).\n- No external data processing, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The code appears to be boilerplate or scaffolding for user-implemented logic.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain any active logic, malicious code, or vulnerabilities. It’s just a template.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Data flow or external interactions:** Absent.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None based on the provided code.\n\n### Review of each report:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks.\n- The reasoning is consistent: placeholder functions with no implementation, no external communication, no suspicious patterns.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified. No malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 is appropriate, given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- They correctly identify that the code is just scaffolding.\n- No need to increase scores or assign higher risk levels.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable given the clear benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, my estimated scores are:**\n\n| Metric            | Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|-------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0      | No malicious activity or code present.                                       |\n| Obfuscated        | 0      | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.                            |\n| Security Risk     | 0      | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious behaviors.                     |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, and the reports are accurate.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a set of placeholder functions intended for user customization in pytest. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
