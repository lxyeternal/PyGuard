{
  "purpose": "The code defines three hook functions for handling assumption failures, assumption passes, and summary reporting in a testing framework, likely pytest.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines functions with parameters that are provided during test execution (lineno, entry, failed_assumptions).",
  "sinks": "The functions do not perform any operations or data outputs; they do not contain sinks that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the functions only contain placeholder 'pass' statements and do not process data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The functions are stub implementations without operational logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides placeholder functions intended for test hooks, with docstrings describing their purpose. It lacks actual logic or data processing, and does not include any dynamic execution, external network calls, or potential malicious behaviors. The functions are safe, and their purpose appears to be to allow user-defined handling of test assumptions during pytest runs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a scaffold for test hooks. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are evident.",
