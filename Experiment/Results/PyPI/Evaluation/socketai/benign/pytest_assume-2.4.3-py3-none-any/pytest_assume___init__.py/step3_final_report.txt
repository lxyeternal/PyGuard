  "purpose": "Assign a benign version string to a variable, with no malicious or suspicious intent.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static assignment of a version string.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; simple static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line assigning a version string to a variable. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no inputs, outputs, or malicious behavior. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The reasoning across reports is consistent and accurate, with high confidence. There are no indications of malicious intent or obfuscation, and the code poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious characteristics. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
