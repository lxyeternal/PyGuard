  "purpose": "Bootstrap script for AWS Lambda runtime, initializing environment and delegating execution to external bootstrap module.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument args[1] for handler, environment variable AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API.",
  "sinks": "The call to bootstrap.run() which may execute the handler or perform network operations depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Input source (args[1], environment variable) passed directly to bootstrap.run() as parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; minimal and standard implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward AWS Lambda bootstrap entry point. It retrieves the handler name from command-line arguments and the runtime API address from environment variables, then calls bootstrap.run() with these parameters. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident within this snippet. The external bootstrap module's behavior is unknown, which could influence security, but based solely on this code, there is no indication of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical AWS Lambda bootstrap script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The external dependency 'bootstrap' is a potential point of concern if compromised, but no evidence of malicious behavior is present in this snippet. Overall, the code is safe and low risk.",
