{
  "purpose": "The script initializes and runs an AWS Lambda function by retrieving the handler name and environment variables, then invoking bootstrap procedures.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API', command-line argument 'args[1]'",
  "sinks": "The 'bootstrap.run' function potentially acts as a sink, executing code based on input parameters",
  "flows": "Command-line argument 'args[1]' flows into the 'handler' variable, then used in 'bootstrap.run'; environment variable 'AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API' flows into 'bootstrap.run'",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; usage of environment variables and command-line args is standard but warrants caution if 'bootstrap.run' executes untrusted code",
  "analysis": "The code reads the current working directory, retrieves a handler name from command-line arguments, and reads an environment variable for the Lambda runtime API address. It then calls 'bootstrap.run' with these parameters. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The only potential concern is reliance on external 'bootstrap' module, but no malicious behavior is evident in this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical AWS Lambda bootstrap script without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It relies on external modules and environment variables as expected for AWS Lambda functions. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security issues are detected based on this code.",
