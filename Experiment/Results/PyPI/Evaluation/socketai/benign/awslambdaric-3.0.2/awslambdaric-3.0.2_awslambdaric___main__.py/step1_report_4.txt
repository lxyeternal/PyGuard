{
  "purpose": "This script initializes a Lambda function runtime environment by retrieving environment variables and command-line arguments, then delegating execution to a bootstrap module.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd() for current directory, sys.argv for command-line arguments, os.environ['AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API'] for environment variables",
  "sinks": "bootstrap.run() function call, which likely executes code based on provided arguments and environment variables",
  "flows": "Main flow involves reading command-line args and environment variables, then passing them to bootstrap.run()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves the current working directory and the first command-line argument as a handler. It also reads an environment variable 'AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API'. These are standard practices for AWS Lambda runtime setup. The code then calls bootstrap.run() with these parameters, which is typical for initializing Lambda functions. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code segments are present. The code relies on external bootstrap module functionality, which is not examined here, but the provided code itself is straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard AWS Lambda runtime initialization script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It securely reads environment variables and command-line arguments, then delegates execution appropriately.",
