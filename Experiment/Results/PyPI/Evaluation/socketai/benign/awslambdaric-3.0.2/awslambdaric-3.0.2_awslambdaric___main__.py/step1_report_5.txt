{
  "purpose": "The code appears to serve as an entry point for a serverless AWS Lambda function, initializing the environment and invoking a bootstrap process.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (args[1]) and environment variable 'AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'bootstrap.run' which likely executes code based on the provided arguments and environment variables.",
  "flows": "The code takes the handler from command-line arguments, reads the environment variable, and passes these to 'bootstrap.run'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; reliance on environment variables is standard. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns. No backdoors or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves the current working directory and extracts the handler name from command-line arguments. It then reads a specific environment variable required for AWS Lambda runtime operation. The bootstrap module's run function is called with these parameters, likely initializing the Lambda environment. The code structure is straightforward, with proper error handling for missing arguments. There is no evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The use of environment variables and external modules appears standard for Lambda functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a typical Lambda bootstrap script. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It simply orchestrates the startup of a Lambda environment using standard practices.",
