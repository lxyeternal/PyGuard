  "conclusion": "The code is a typical AWS Lambda bootstrap script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The external dependency 'bootstrap' is a potential point of concern if compromised, but no evidence of malicious behavior is present in this snippet. Overall, the code is safe and low risk."
