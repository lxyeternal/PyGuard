{
  "purpose": "This script initializes and runs a Lambda function handler by retrieving environment variables and command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "os.environ['AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API'] retrieves an environment variable; sys.argv retrieves command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "bootstrap.run() potentially executes the handler, possibly executing untrusted input if not properly sanitized.",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1] (handler) -> bootstrap.run() with app_root, handler, and environment variable",
  "anomalies": "Direct access to environment variable AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API without validation; no input sanitization or validation for handler parameter.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a critical environment variable AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API, which is necessary for Lambda runtime operation. It also reads the handler name from command-line arguments. The handler is passed directly to bootstrap.run() without validation or sanitization. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. It does not include any network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of environment variables and command-line arguments is typical for serverless functions. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple Lambda startup script that retrieves environment variables and command-line arguments to initialize the runtime. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. However, it relies on external bootstrap.run() implementation for execution, which is assumed to be safe.",
