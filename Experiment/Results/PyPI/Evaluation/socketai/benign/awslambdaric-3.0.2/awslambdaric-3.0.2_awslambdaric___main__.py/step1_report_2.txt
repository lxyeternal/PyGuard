{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and runs a serverless application using AWS Lambda runtime, setting up environment variables and invoking bootstrap procedures.",
  "sources": "The code reads the command-line argument for the handler (args[1]) and the environment variable 'AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API'.",
  "sinks": "The handler argument is passed to bootstrap.run, which likely involves executing user-specified functions. The environment variable is used for runtime API communication.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument (handler) and environment variable (AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API) flow into bootstrap.run, which is invoked with application root, handler, and API address.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; environment variable access is standard. No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code relies on standard AWS Lambda environment and bootstrap functions.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily collects runtime parameters and invokes bootstrap.run. It expects the handler argument and environment variable to be set, which are typical in AWS Lambda environments. No untrusted input handling beyond command-line arguments; no code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious code behavior. The code does not perform any network communication directly, nor does it manipulate files or data in a suspicious manner.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard AWS Lambda entry point, responsible for starting the runtime environment. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, contain hidden backdoors, or perform malicious actions. It relies on external bootstrap logic, which should be reviewed separately, but this snippet alone is benign.",
