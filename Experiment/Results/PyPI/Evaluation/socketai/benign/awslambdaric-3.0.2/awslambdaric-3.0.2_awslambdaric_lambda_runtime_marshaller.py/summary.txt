  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured JSON utility tailored for AWS Lambda, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The main potential issue is the use of math.nan in JSON output, which could cause downstream JSON parsing errors if not handled properly. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 due to the NaN handling. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
