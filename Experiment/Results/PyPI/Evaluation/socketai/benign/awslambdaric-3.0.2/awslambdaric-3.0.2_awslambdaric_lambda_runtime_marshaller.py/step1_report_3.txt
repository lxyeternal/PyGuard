  "purpose": "Custom JSON encoding and decoding for AWS Lambda functions with special handling for decimal types.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AWS_EXECUTION_ENV), input request data via 'unmarshal_request', response data via 'marshal_response'.",
  "sinks": "json.loads and json.encode functions, which process input/output data, potentially untrusted if sourced externally.",
  "flows": "Environment variable AWS_EXECUTION_ENV influences constructor behavior; unmarshal_request reads input data; marshal_response encodes output data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'math.nan' for NaN values in JSON encoding, which can produce non-standard JSON. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code correctly handles exceptions during JSON serialization/deserialization.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom JSON encoding and decoding tailored for AWS Lambda environments, particularly handling decimal.Decimal objects with care for NaN values. It relies on environment variables to configure behavior but does not access or store sensitive data. The use of 'math.nan' as a JSON value could lead to non-standard JSON output, but this is consistent with the comment and expected behavior. The unmarshal_request and marshal_response methods are straightforward wrappers around standard JSON functions with exception handling. No external network access, file system modification, or suspicious activity is present. Overall, the code appears to serve a utility purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements custom JSON serialization/deserialization with environment-aware configuration. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The handling of NaN is noteworthy but not malicious. It appears safe and intended for internal use in AWS Lambda functions.",
