  "purpose": "Custom JSON encoding and decoding for AWS Lambda functions, with special handling for decimal.Decimal objects and environment-specific settings.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'AWS_EXECUTION_ENV', input request data via 'unmarshal_request', data to be marshaled via 'marshal_response'.",
  "sinks": "json.loads, json.encode, raise FaultException for errors.",
  "flows": "Input request (via unmarshal_request) -> json.loads (parsing request) -> response encoding via json.encode in marshal_response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of math.nan for NaN decimals is standard practice. Environment variable check for execution environment is typical for environment-specific configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a custom JSON encoder that handles decimal.Decimal objects, converting NaN values to math.nan and encoding other Decimals as strings. The 'to_json' function encodes objects using this encoder. The LambdaMarshaller class handles request unmarshalling with json.loads and response marshalling, catching exceptions and raising FaultException on errors. No malicious behavior or sabotage indicators are present. There are no suspicious external calls, secret leaks, or backdoors. Usage of environment variables is standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for JSON serialization/deserialization tailored for AWS Lambda, with environment-specific configurations and error handling. No malicious intent or security risks detected.",
