{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom JSON encoding and marshalling logic for AWS Lambda functions, handling decimal support and request/response processing.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('AWS_EXECUTION_ENV'), input request data, and objects to encode.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs encoded JSON strings, exceptions, and encoded responses.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences encoder initialization -> request unmarshalling -> response marshalling -> exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; exception handling is standard; no external network activity or file manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code safely handles JSON encoding with special treatment for decimal.Decimal objects, including NaN values. It respects environment variables for configuration, and exception handling for marshalling/unmarshalling appears standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels. Usage of custom encoder and exception raising is typical for robust Lambda functions. The code does not perform any dangerous operations beyond JSON processing. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, safe JSON encoding and request/response marshalling logic for AWS Lambda, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
