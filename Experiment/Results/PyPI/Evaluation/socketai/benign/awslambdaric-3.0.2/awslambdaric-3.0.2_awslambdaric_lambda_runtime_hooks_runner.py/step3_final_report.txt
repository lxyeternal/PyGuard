  "purpose": "Execute callback functions retrieved from external functions before and after snapshot restore operations.",
  "sources": "The functions get_before_snapshot() and get_after_restore() which return lists of callables with their arguments.",
  "sinks": "The execution of callables via func(*args, **kwargs), potentially executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Callbacks are retrieved from external functions and then invoked in sequence (reverse order for before snapshot, forward for after restore).",
  "anomalies": "Use of pop() for reverse execution is standard; no suspicious or obfuscated code detected; reliance on external callback lists without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly executes callback functions from external sources without internal validation. The use of pop() for reverse order execution is typical. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws are present within this snippet. The primary risk depends on whether the external functions provide malicious callables, which is outside the scope of this code. The malware score is zero, and obfuscation is absent. The security risk score is low (around 0.2), reflecting reliance on external trustworthiness. The scores across reports are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of external callback sources. The assigned scores are appropriate, indicating low malware risk and minimal obfuscation, with a moderate security risk due to external dependencies.",
