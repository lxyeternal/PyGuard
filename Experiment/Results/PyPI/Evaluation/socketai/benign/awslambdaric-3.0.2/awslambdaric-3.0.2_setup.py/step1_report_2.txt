  "purpose": "Setup script for AWS Lambda Runtime Interface Client, including building native extensions and managing dependencies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., 'BUILD'), subprocess calls ('check_call', 'check_output'), and file reads ('read').",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls (executing './scripts/preinstall.sh' and curl-config), potential network calls via subprocess, and file reads for requirements and README.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'BUILD' influences whether build steps are executed. 'check_call' executes build scripts, and 'check_output' retrieves linker flags. Files are read for package info and requirements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Use of subprocess to run scripts and external commands is standard in build scripts, but it could be misused if scripts are malicious. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a setup script for building a Python package with native C++ extensions. It conditionally executes build scripts and external commands based on platform and environment variables, which is typical for build processes. The subprocess calls invoke scripts and tools like curl-config, which are common in build environments. The code reads files for package metadata and dependencies, with no indications of malicious intent. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network abuse, or backdoors. All external commands appear related to legitimate build steps.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with conditional build steps and no malicious behavior detected. It performs typical package build operations and manages dependencies securely. No malicious or suspicious activities are present.",
