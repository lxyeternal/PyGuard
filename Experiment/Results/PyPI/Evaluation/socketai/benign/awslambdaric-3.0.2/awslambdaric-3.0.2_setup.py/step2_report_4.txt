  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or similar setup scripts for building the AWS Lambda Runtime Interface Client.\n- The scripts execute external shell scripts ('preinstall.sh') and commands ('curl-config'), which is standard in build processes.\n- No report mentions any suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads.\n- The scripts rely on environment variables and external scripts/commands, which could be manipulated if those external components are compromised, but this is typical for build scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- External script execution (`./scripts/preinstall.sh`) and command execution (`curl-config`) are present.\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks within the provided code.\n- The code is standard for building native extensions and managing dependencies.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify the reliance on external scripts and commands, which could be a security concern if those external components are compromised, but this is a common practice.\n- No actual code errors or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The code does not perform any insecure operations beyond standard build procedures.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis that there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low), justified given reliance on external scripts but no direct malicious activity.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n- The only concern is external script execution, but this is typical in build scripts, not malicious.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly identifies that the external scripts and commands could be manipulated outside this code, but this is a standard caveat.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, obfuscation, and low security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to external dependencies but no malicious intent)\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard build setup script with external script and command execution, which is typical in such contexts. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The low risk score is justified, but the reliance on external scripts and commands warrants standard security practices, not an elevated concern.\n\n**Final note:** Ensure external scripts like 'preinstall.sh' are maintained securely and verified to prevent supply chain risks.",
