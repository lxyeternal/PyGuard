  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a build/setup script for the AWS Lambda Runtime Interface Client, involving external scripts and commands.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware signatures is found.\n- The code executes external scripts ('preinstall.sh') and commands ('curl-config') without input sanitization, but this is standard in build scripts.\n- External scripts and commands could be manipulated if compromised, but the code itself is benign.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or malware.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The reliance on external scripts and commands without validation could be a concern but is typical for build scripts.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, with low security risk (~0.2), which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Critical points:\n- The **external scripts and commands** (e.g., 'preinstall.sh', 'curl-config') are external dependencies. If these are compromised, malicious behavior could be introduced outside this code's scope.\n- The code **does not** perform any network activity beyond calling external commands, nor does it handle sensitive data.\n- The **use of subprocess** is standard for build scripts, and no malicious patterns are evident.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0, since no malicious activity or payloads are detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is reasonable given reliance on external scripts, but the code itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard build setup script, executing external scripts and commands as part of the build process.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected within this code snippet.\n- The main security concern is external script integrity, which is outside the scope of this code review.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to external dependencies, but not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and does not exhibit any malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores provided by the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
