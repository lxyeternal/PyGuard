{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for building the AWS Lambda Runtime Interface Client, managing dependencies, and compiling native extensions.",
  "sources": "External scripts ('./scripts/preinstall.sh') and commands ('curl-config') invoked via subprocess during build time.",
  "sinks": "External scripts and commands could potentially execute malicious code if compromised, but within this code, no direct sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The script calls external scripts and commands without input validation, which could be manipulated externally, but no malicious flow is detected within the code itself.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are present. External script reliance is standard but warrants external integrity checks.",
  "analysis": "The code executes external scripts and commands during setup, which is typical for build processes. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The reliance on external scripts ('preinstall.sh') and commands ('curl-config') could be a vector if those external components are compromised, but this is outside the scope of the code review. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The scores assigned by the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the analysis, reflecting a low security risk primarily due to external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build/setup script with no malicious or obfuscated behavior detected. The low risk score is justified, and the malware score remains at 0. External script integrity should be verified in supply chain management, but the code itself is safe.",
