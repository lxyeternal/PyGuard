{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom JSON-based log formatter for Python's logging module, providing structured logging with optional stack trace and error information.",
  "sources": "Reads logging records, environment variables, and standard Python modules (json, logging, traceback, enum).",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted JSON strings representing log records.",
  "flows": "Logging record creation → formatting via JsonFormatter.format() → output as JSON string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of environment variables is limited to log levels, which is safe. No dynamic code execution or network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on formatting log records into JSON format, with functions to handle stack traces, exception info, and log levels. The use of static mappings for frame types and log levels suggests straightforward, controlled behavior. No user input or untrusted data sources are processed outside logging records, and output is strictly formatted JSON. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, network connections, or credential theft. The code appears well-structured and intended solely for logging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a safe and standard logging formatter implementation with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
