  "purpose": "A JSON log formatter for Python's logging module that formats log records into JSON, including exception info and custom attributes.",
  "sources": "LogRecord attributes such as levelno, levelname, exc_info, pathname, funcName, lineno, message, and custom attributes like aws_request_id.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON-formatted log strings to standard output or log handlers; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "LogRecord data flows into a dictionary, which is serialized into JSON via _encode_json, then output as a string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data handling. Environment variable usage is limited to log level mapping, which is safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a structured logging formatter that converts log records into JSON, capturing exception info, stack traces, and custom attributes. It uses standard libraries and safe practices. No network, file, or code injection activities are present. The exception formatting functions are straightforward, and the environment variable handling is limited to log level mapping. The code is clear, readable, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard JSON logging formatter with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It handles exception info and custom attributes safely, with no external communication or risky behaviors. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to logs potentially containing sensitive data if misused, which is a common concern in logging systems but not specific to this code. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for production use.",
