{
  "purpose": "Defines AWS Lambda context objects, handling environment variables, identity info, and logging mechanisms for Lambda functions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_GROUP_NAME, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME), input dictionaries for object attributes, logging handlers.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs to sys.stdout or custom log_sink objects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and input dicts into object attributes; logs are sent to handlers or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, standard boilerplate for AWS Lambda context management. It reads environment variables, constructs context objects, and logs messages. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious data flows. All observed signals are benign, and the code aligns with typical AWS Lambda utility patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard AWS Lambda context setup code with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. The overall security posture is very low risk.",
