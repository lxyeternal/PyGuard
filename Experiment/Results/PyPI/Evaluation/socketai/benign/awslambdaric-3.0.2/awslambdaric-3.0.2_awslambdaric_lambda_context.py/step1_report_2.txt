{
  "purpose": "Define classes and functions to represent and initialize AWS Lambda execution context, including environment variables and identity information.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_GROUP_NAME, AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_STREAM_NAME, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_VERSION); input parameters to class constructors (e.g., client_context, cognito_identity).",
  "sinks": "Logging via sys.stdout.write; potentially vulnerable if msg contains untrusted input, but no external data outputting to network or files is directly present.",
  "flows": "Input data from environment variables and function arguments populates object attributes; log messages flow from method calls to stdout or log sink handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. Usage of environment variables is typical for Lambda contexts; no obfuscated code or malicious functions present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely creates classes modeling AWS Lambda context and identity, initializes their attributes from environment variables and parameters, and provides logging functions. No external network communication, file modifications, or malicious data handling is present. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for Lambda environment simulation or testing. It does not contain any malicious logic or indicators of supply chain attack.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for AWS Lambda context modeling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It uses environment variables and parameters in a typical manner without any suspicious operations.",
