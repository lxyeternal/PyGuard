{
  "purpose": "Define classes and functions for creating and handling AWS Lambda context objects, including environment variables and identity information.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ.get; function arguments such as client_context and cognito_identity; time.time() for current timestamp.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs via logging handlers or sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and input dictionaries to class instances, with potential logging output to stdout or handlers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for AWS Lambda context; no suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly sets up context objects for AWS Lambda functions, reading environment variables, and mapping input dictionaries to objects. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or suspicious behavior are evident. Logging is directed to standard output or handlers, with no evidence of data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The code appears standard and safe for its purpose, primarily focusing on context object management without external or malicious interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of AWS Lambda context classes with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions as a utility for managing context data, with standard logging practices. No malicious behavior or supply chain security issues are detected.",
