{
  "purpose": "This code implements an AWS Lambda runtime bootstrap, handling request processing, logging, error management, environment variable updates, and traceback processing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, JSON headers, modules, traceback frames, request data, environment variables for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Logs to log_sink (stdout or custom), environment variables, invocation result or error posting via lambda_runtime_client, environment variables for trace IDs.",
  "flows": "Input data from environment variables and headers flows into request handling functions; errors or responses flow into logs and invocation result/error posting; environment variables are updated for tracing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected. Traceback filtering and error handling are standard. No external connections or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard AWS Lambda bootstrap implementation with request handling, logging, error processing, environment variable management, and traceback extraction. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The environment variables are used for configuration, not secrets. Logging is consistent, and traceback filtering avoids including bootstrap frames. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified by the code's clarity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate AWS Lambda runtime bootstrap with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The operational risk is minimal and consistent with standard runtime code.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
