  "purpose": "The code initializes, handles, and logs AWS Lambda functions, including error handling, event processing, and logging setup.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_FORMAT, AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_LEVEL, AWS_EXECUTION_ENV, _LAMBDA_TELEMETRY_LOG_FD, AWS_LAMBDA_INITIALIZATION_TYPE, _X_AMZN_TRACE_ID), sys.stdin, sys.stdout, sys.stderr, imported modules, and request parameters.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs to sys.stdout, sys.stderr, and files via os.fdopen; external network calls are not present; logs are formatted and written through custom handlers.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> logging setup -> event handling -> request processing -> error handling -> logging -> output responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation observed. The code appears to be standard AWS Lambda bootstrap logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages Lambda function invocation, including dynamic module import, error handling, logging setup, context creation, and event processing. The logging functions adapt based on log format, but do not perform any suspicious data collection. Error handling includes traceback extraction and structured error reporting, which is typical for debugging and monitoring. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or credential theft mechanisms are present. The import statements are standard, and there are no hidden or malicious side effects. Overall, the code is consistent with a typical Lambda bootstrap and runtime handler without signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard AWS Lambda runtime bootstrap implementation with no detected malicious behavior or security risks. It manages logging, error handling, and event processing securely without any suspicious patterns. The overall security risk is low.",
