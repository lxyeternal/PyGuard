      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard JSON logging formatter with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It handles exception info and custom attributes safely, with no external communication or risky behaviors. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to logs potentially containing sensitive data if misused, which is a common concern in logging systems but not specific to this code. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for production use."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured JSON utility tailored for AWS Lambda, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The main potential issue is the use of math.nan in JSON output, which could cause downstream JSON parsing errors if not handled properly. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 due to the NaN handling. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
