  "purpose": "The code snippet appears to be a simple metadata declaration for a Python package, specifying the version number.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or sensitive operations are present, so no sinks are identified.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks since the code is limited to a version string assignment and a comment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a comment and a variable assignment; no unusual or suspicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a copyright comment and a version variable assignment. It does not perform any input/output, data processing, or security-sensitive operations. The content is typical for a module's metadata header. There is no evidence of malicious activity or hidden behavior. The overall structure and content are straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard header snippet for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain any suspicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation.",
