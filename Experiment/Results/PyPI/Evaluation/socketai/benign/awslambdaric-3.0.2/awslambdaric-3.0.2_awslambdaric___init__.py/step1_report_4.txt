  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python module with version information and a copyright notice.",
  "sources": "The only source is the hardcoded __version__ variable and the comment with copyright info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets beyond version info, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of a version string assignment and a copyright comment. There are no functions, no data input, no network activity, and no suspicious constructs. The absence of any dynamic or sensitive operations indicates low risk. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a metadata or informational fragment with no signs of malicious intent or security risk.",
