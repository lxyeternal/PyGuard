  "purpose": "Metadata declaration containing version information and copyright notice.",
  "sources": "The code reads a copyright comment and assigns a version string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static snippet with a comment and a version string assignment. It contains no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious constructs. The code serves as metadata in a package, typical for versioning and licensing info. Given its simplicity, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in all reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, static metadata snippet with no security concerns or malicious intent. All assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
