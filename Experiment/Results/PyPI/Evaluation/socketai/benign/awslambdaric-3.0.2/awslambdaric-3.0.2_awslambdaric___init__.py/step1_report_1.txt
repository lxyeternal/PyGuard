  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple module declaration, likely part of a larger Python package, setting a version number.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; code does not process any data.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with only a copyright statement, version assignment, and a docstring; no unusual or suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a copyright comment, a version string assignment, and an empty or non-executing docstring. There are no functions, no data processing, no network operations, or any suspicious logic. It appears to be a benign, standard metadata snippet typical in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless, minimal fragment providing licensing and version information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
