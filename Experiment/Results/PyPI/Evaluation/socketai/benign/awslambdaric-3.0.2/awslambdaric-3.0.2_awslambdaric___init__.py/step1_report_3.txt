{
  "purpose": "This code snippet appears to be a minimal module or script that primarily contains a copyright statement and a version identifier.",
  "sources": "The only source is the string assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external interactions are observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident, as the code consists solely of a metadata assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal and lacks any functional or operational logic. No suspicious or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a copyright comment, a version string assignment, and no further logic or data processing. It does not include input/output, external calls, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are evident. It appears to be a fragment or metadata component of a larger codebase, with no security concerns in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "There is no malicious behavior or security risk present in this code snippet. It is a benign piece of metadata, likely part of a larger project. The code does not perform any actions, leaks data, or contain suspicious constructs.",
