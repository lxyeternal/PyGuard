  "purpose": "Define warning messages related to AWS Lambda runtime issues and unhandled exceptions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the string 'LAMBDA_WARNING' and converts a formatted string into 'lambda_unhandled_exception_warning_message'.",
  "sinks": "The string concatenation and conversion are local operations; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "flows": "No external data flows; only internal string operations are performed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden malicious intent detected. The code simply defines constants and a descriptive message.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a constant warning message for Lambda functions, explicitly mentioning AWS Lambda behavior and referencing official documentation. There are no inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The code appears to be for documentation or logging purposes only, with no indication of malicious behavior or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a set of warning message constants related to AWS Lambda runtime issues. No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
