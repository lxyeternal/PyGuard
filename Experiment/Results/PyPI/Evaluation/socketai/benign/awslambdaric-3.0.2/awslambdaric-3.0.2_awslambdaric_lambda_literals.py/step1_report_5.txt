  "purpose": "Define warning messages related to AWS Lambda runtime issues and unhandled exceptions.",
  "sources": "String concatenation and assignment operations, reading no external input.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs straightforward string handling and variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a warning string variable with a message about unhandled exceptions in AWS Lambda functions. The message is constructed using string formatting and concatenation, referencing AWS documentation URL. No external inputs are processed, and there are no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution. The code is purely informational and related to documentation or logging messages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard documentation-related string initialization for AWS Lambda warning messages. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It is a benign snippet intended for informational purposes.",
