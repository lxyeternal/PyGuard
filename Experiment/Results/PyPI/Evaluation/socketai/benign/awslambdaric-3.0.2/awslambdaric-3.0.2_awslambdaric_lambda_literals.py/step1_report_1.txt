{
  "purpose": "Define warning messages related to AWS Lambda unhandled exceptions and runtime updates",
  "sources": "The code reads a constant string for the warning message and constructs another string using str()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or output sinks involved",
  "flows": "Constant string assignment and string formatting; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior observed; the code appears to be standard documentation and warning message setup",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a string variable 'lambda_warning' and constructs a detailed warning message 'lambda_unhandled_exception_warning_message' based on it. The content is static, includes no dynamic input, no user data handling, and no network activity. The message references AWS Lambda runtime management, which is standard documentation. No evidence of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup of warning messages related to AWS Lambda runtime issues. It contains no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
