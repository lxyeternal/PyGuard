  "purpose": "Static string definitions for AWS Lambda runtime warning messages, intended for documentation or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "No dynamic input, external data, or network activity; only string assignments and formatting.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static strings assigned without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string variables defining warning messages related to AWS Lambda runtime issues. There are no dynamic inputs, external data sources, or network interactions. The code is simple, clear, and free of obfuscation or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no security risks or malware. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are present. The code does not process untrusted data, nor does it perform any operations that could lead to security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of warning message definitions with no malicious intent or security implications. The reports accurately assess this, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
