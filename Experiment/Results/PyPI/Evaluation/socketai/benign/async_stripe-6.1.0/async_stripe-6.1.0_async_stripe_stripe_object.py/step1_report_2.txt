{
  "purpose": "This code provides asynchronous methods for making HTTP requests to Stripe's API, updating the StripeObject class with patched request functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as api_key, idempotency_key, stripe_version, stripe_account, headers, and params; also reads from util.read_special_variable.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request via api_requestor.APIRequestor.request and request_stream, converting responses to StripeObject, and potentially exposing sensitive data via headers or parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed via util.read_special_variable, then used to configure APIRequestor; request is made, response is processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic patching of StripeObject methods; reliance on util functions to read variables; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns; no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code patches StripeObject with asynchronous request methods, incorporating configuration and security parameters from input or object properties. It uses utility functions to read variables securely and performs network requests through the APIRequestor class. No suspicious or malicious activities, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic detected. The structure aligns with standard API request handling patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, focusing on API request handling with proper parameter processing. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. It functions as a standard extension or patch to Stripe's object methods.",
