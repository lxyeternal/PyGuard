{
  "purpose": "The code defines asynchronous patch request methods for Stripe API interactions, allowing customized API calls with optional parameters and headers.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from function parameters, local variables, and utility functions such as util.read_special_variable.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network request functions (api_requestor.APIRequestor.request and request_stream) which send data over the network.",
  "flows": "Input data from parameters and utility functions flow into request construction, which then triggers network requests to Stripe's API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of dynamic parameter handling appears standard. No unusual code structures or obfuscation are present. The code relies on external utility functions and an API requestor class, which appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements async wrapper methods for HTTP PATCH and stream requests to Stripe API, utilizing flexible parameter handling and optional headers. It does not include any suspicious or malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system manipulation. The use of utility functions and API request classes seems typical for SDK or API client code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The functions' purpose is to facilitate secure and configurable API communication, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard API client code for Stripe with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It manages API requests and headers in a typical manner without suspicious behavior.",
