{
  "purpose": "Asynchronous methods patching the StripeObject class to facilitate PATCH and stream requests, handling parameters and headers dynamically for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Parameters provided to the functions, utility functions reading environment variables or special variables, class attributes such as self.api_key, self.stripe_account, self.stripe_version.",
  "sinks": "Network requests via api_requestor.APIRequestor.request and request_stream methods, transmitting data over the network to Stripe's API endpoints.",
  "flows": "Parameters and headers are read and potentially modified, then passed into network request functions which send data to Stripe's servers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. Use of dynamic method patching is standard in SDKs but could be considered unusual if context suggests malicious intent, which it does not here.",
  "analysis": "The code patches existing classes with async methods to perform API requests, utilizing utility functions for parameter handling and constructing requestor objects for network communication. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or insecure practices are evident. The code is consistent with standard SDK patterns, with parameters and headers managed securely and requests made asynchronously. Utility functions are assumed to be safe, and no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are justified based on the code's clarity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard extension of the Stripe SDK for asynchronous API interactions. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scoring in the reports is accurate and appropriate.",
