  "purpose": "Extend the Stripe Charge class with methods to mark a charge as fraudulent or safe by sending POST requests to the Stripe API.",
  "sources": "self.instance_url() and util.populate_headers(idempotency_key) which generate the URL and headers for API requests.",
  "sinks": "self.request(\"post\", url, params, headers) which performs the API call with specified parameters and headers.",
  "flows": "From source methods (instance_url, populate_headers) to the request method, which sends the data to the Stripe API to update fraud status.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code uses standard Stripe SDK methods. The functions are defined as async and modify the stripe.Charge class dynamically, which is common but should be checked for malicious intent. No obfuscated or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code adds two asynchronous methods to the stripe.Charge class for marking a charge as fraudulent or safe. These methods prepare parameters, generate headers, and perform a POST request to update the charge's fraud status via Stripe's API. The code relies on existing SDK methods, and the logic is straightforward for API interaction. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious network connections. The code appears to be intended for legitimate fraud management within Stripe's API ecosystem.",
  "conclusion": "This code extends the Stripe SDK with methods for marking charges as fraudulent or safe, using standard API requests. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code is typical for SDK customization and does not pose a security threat.",
