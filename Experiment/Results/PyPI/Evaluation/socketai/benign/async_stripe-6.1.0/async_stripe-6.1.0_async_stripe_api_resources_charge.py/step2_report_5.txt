  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the same core functionality: dynamically adding two async methods (`mark_as_fraudulent` and `mark_as_safe`) to the `stripe.Charge` class, which perform POST requests to Stripe's API to update fraud details.\n- The sources, sinks, and flows are consistent: obtaining the URL, headers (via `util.populate_headers`), and making API requests with parameters.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are identified.\n- The code is described as a legitimate extension or utility for managing fraud status within Stripe's SDK.\n- The overall confidence in these assessments is high (~0.9), with no malware or obfuscation scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Concerns:\n\n**Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n- The code snippets match the described functionality.\n- No errors, flaws, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The dynamic method patching, while somewhat unconventional, is a known pattern in Python for extending classes at runtime and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Malware & security risk:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious intent.\n- The security risk is low (~0.1–0.2), primarily because the code performs API calls that could be misused if embedded maliciously, but there's no evidence of such misuse here.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n- The code relies on `stripe.util.populate_headers`, which likely manages API keys securely, assuming proper SDK practices.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious data exfiltration or malicious network activity.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1–0.2) are consistent with the analysis.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low given the functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n- No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.1–0.2**  \n- Slightly above zero due to external API calls, but these are standard SDK interactions. The code is intended for legitimate fraud management, not malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a legitimate extension of the Stripe SDK to manage fraud status on charges. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities beyond normal API interaction risks, which are minimal here.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect a safe, transparent, and standard SDK extension.",
