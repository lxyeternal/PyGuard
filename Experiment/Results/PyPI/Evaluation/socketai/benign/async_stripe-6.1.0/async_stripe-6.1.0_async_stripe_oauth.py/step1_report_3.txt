{
  "purpose": "This code customizes the Stripe Python library's OAuth token and deauthorization functions with asynchronous implementations.",
  "sources": "The code reads parameters passed to token_patch and deauthorize_patch functions, including API keys and OAuth parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with Stripe's API endpoints '/oauth/token' and '/oauth/deauthorize', which handle sensitive OAuth tokens and deauthorization data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (including API keys and OAuth parameters) flow into request construction, which then executes HTTP requests to Stripe's OAuth endpoints, returning response data.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses asynchronous functions with Stripe's requestor, which is unusual since Stripe's standard SDK is synchronous. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are observed. The assignment of static methods to OAuth class overrides default behavior but appears to be a customization, not malicious. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines Stripe OAuth token and deauthorize methods with async variants, possibly for integration with an async environment. It constructs requests using API keys and a base URL, then executes them asynchronously. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present. The modifications do not appear to perform any malicious actions, such as data exfiltration or backdoor access. The use of async functions for Stripe's API is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate customization of Stripe's OAuth methods for asynchronous operation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. The modifications serve to enable async calls, which are not suspicious in themselves.",
