  "conclusion": "The code is a benign customization of Stripe's OAuth methods to support asynchronous operations. It does not contain malicious code or payloads. The main concern is potential misuse if parameters are maliciously crafted, but overall, the code is not malicious. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low to moderate security risk score (~0.2-0.4)."
