  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code replaces Stripe's OAuth methods with custom async functions. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No input validation or error handling shown; potential misuse if parameters are malicious, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0. The low security risk aligns with the absence of malicious intent.\n- **Justification for scores:** Since the code only overrides methods without malicious payloads, the scores seem appropriate.\n- **Overall:** No malicious activity detected. The override could be misused if parameters are malicious, but the code itself is not malicious.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to Report 1, overrides OAuth methods with custom async functions.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No input validation, and calling `set_client_id` on `params` without validation could lead to unintended behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.4, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher security risk due to method overriding and parameter handling, but no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Overall:** The risk is moderate but not malicious.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Custom async OAuth methods, unusual but not malicious.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious payloads.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Justification:** The code is a legitimate async adaptation, low risk.\n- **Overall:** No malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Overrides OAuth methods with async functions.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No validation, potential for misuse if parameters are malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n- **Justification:** Similar to previous reports, low risk, no malware.\n- **Overall:** The modification could be exploited but is not malicious per se.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Custom OAuth management functions.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, standard practice.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n- **Overall:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious payloads or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Generally low (0.2), reflecting potential misuse if parameters are malicious, but no direct malicious activity.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3 (low, primarily due to method overriding without validation)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate customization of Stripe's OAuth methods for asynchronous operation. While the method overrides could be exploited if parameters are malicious, the code itself does not contain malicious logic. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the low malware and obfuscated scores. Slightly increase the security risk score to 0.3 if considering potential misuse in a supply chain context, but overall, the code is not malicious.",
