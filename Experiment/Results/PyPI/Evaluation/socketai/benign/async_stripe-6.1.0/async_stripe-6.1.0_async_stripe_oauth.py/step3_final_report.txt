  "purpose": "Override Stripe's OAuth token and deauthorize methods with asynchronous implementations to facilitate non-blocking OAuth operations.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to token_patch and deauthorize_patch functions, including api_key and other params used in request.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Stripe's OAuth endpoints (/oauth/token and /oauth/deauthorize) with sensitive data such as tokens and client IDs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into APIRequestor requests, which send POST requests to Stripe's OAuth endpoints, returning response data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of async functions to override SDK methods; no input validation or error handling shown; straightforward code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines Stripe's OAuth methods asynchronously, creating APIRequestor instances with provided API keys and making POST requests to OAuth endpoints. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The use of async functions is unusual but not malicious. Lack of input validation and error handling could pose risks if malicious parameters are supplied, but this does not constitute malicious activity. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is moderate (~0.2-0.4) due to method overriding without validation. The code appears to be a legitimate customization for async OAuth handling, with potential misuse if parameters are malicious, but no evidence of malicious intent or payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign customization of Stripe's OAuth methods to support asynchronous operations. It does not contain malicious code or payloads. The main concern is potential misuse if parameters are maliciously crafted, but overall, the code is not malicious. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low to moderate security risk score (~0.2-0.4).",
