  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code redefines Stripe's OAuth token and deauthorize methods with asynchronous functions.\n- These functions create an APIRequestor with provided API keys and perform POST requests to Stripe OAuth endpoints.\n- The functions are assigned as static methods to `stripe.OAuth`, replacing default implementations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code lacks input validation and error handling, but this alone does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose:** Overrides OAuth methods with async implementations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8\n- **Comments:** The report states no malicious behavior, just method overriding for async handling. The low malware and risk scores seem appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. The code itself is not malicious, but the override could be misused if parameters are maliciously crafted.\n\n**Adjustment:** The security risk could be slightly higher due to method overriding, but given no malicious activity, 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, overriding OAuth methods.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.4, confidence=0.7\n- **Comments:** Slightly higher risk score due to potential misuse of method overriding and parameter handling.\n- **Verdict:** Given the lack of malicious payloads, the risk score of 0.4 might be a bit high but still acceptable. The malware score remains 0, which is correct.\n\n**Adjustment:** No change needed; the reasoning aligns with the low malicious potential.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same override with async functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Comments:** The report emphasizes the unusual use of async but finds no malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** The low malware and risk scores are justified.\n\n**Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar override with async functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8\n- **Comments:** The code modifies SDK methods, which could be misused but isn't malicious per se.\n- **Verdict:** The low malware score is appropriate; the risk score is also justified.\n\n**Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Comments:** No malicious behavior; the code appears legitimate.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious payload or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all cases, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.2–0.4). Given the method overrides and lack of validation, a slightly higher risk could be justified, but the current scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3 (method overriding without validation is a minor concern but not inherently dangerous)\n\n**Final justification:**\n\nThe code is a legitimate attempt to customize Stripe OAuth handling for asynchronous operation. While method overriding can be risky if misused, there is no evidence of malicious intent or payloads. The lack of input validation is a concern but not a sign of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric          | Estimated Score | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                 | No malicious payloads or behaviors present.                |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                 | Code is clear and straightforward.                          |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2–0.3           | Overriding SDK methods without validation; moderate concern.|\n\n**Recommendation:** The current scores are reasonable. If stricter, consider raising the risk slightly due to method overriding, but overall, the code appears benign.",
