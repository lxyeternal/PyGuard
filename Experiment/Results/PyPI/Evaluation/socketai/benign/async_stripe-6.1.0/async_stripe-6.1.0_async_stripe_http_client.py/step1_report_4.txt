{
  "purpose": "Implement a custom asynchronous HTTP client using Tornado for Stripe API communication with retry logic.",
  "sources": "Imports from stripe, tornado, and util modules; internal functions and class methods handling HTTP requests and retries.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the request handling methods could process untrusted data, but they only make network requests and handle responses.",
  "flows": "HTTP request is initiated in _request_internal, with retries managed by _request_with_retries_internal, responses are processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code or malicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code follows standard patterns for an async HTTP client.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Tornado-based asynchronous HTTP client for Stripe with retry logic. It captures request and response handling, including error management. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious network connections, or backdoors. The retry mechanism and error handling are standard, with no suspicious behavior. The code appears to be legitimate, focused on resilient API communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an async HTTP client for Stripe, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It uses standard practices for retries and error handling without any malicious payload or obfuscated logic.",
