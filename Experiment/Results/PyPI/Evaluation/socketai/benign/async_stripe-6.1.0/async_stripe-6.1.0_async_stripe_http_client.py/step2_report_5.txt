  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: an async HTTP client for Stripe using Tornado, with retry logic, error handling, and standard network request patterns.\n- No mention of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads.\n- The code appears to be a typical, well-structured implementation for network communication within an SDK context.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1–0.2), reflecting minor concerns about network errors or potential misconfigurations but no active vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No, all reports agree that the code is standard, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No significant errors or flaws are identified. The code is consistent with typical async HTTP client implementations.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which is consistent with the analysis. The security risk scores are low, reflecting standard retry and error handling without active vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Given the absence of malicious behavior, the malware score of 0 is justified and should remain.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports state no obfuscation; score 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  The scores (~0.1–0.2) are reasonable. The only minor concern is network errors or potential misconfigurations, but nothing indicates active vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Potential issues or assumptions:**  \n  No suspicious assumptions or claims are made in the reports. The code does not perform any suspicious operations like data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of an async HTTP client for Stripe.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to network error handling, not active vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a well-structured, standard async HTTP client with retry logic, no malicious indicators, and appropriate scoring. No changes are necessary to the report scores or conclusions.",
