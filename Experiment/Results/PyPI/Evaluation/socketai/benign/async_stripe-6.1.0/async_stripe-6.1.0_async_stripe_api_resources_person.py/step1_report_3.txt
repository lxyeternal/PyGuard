{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the stripe library's Person class by overriding the modify and retrieve class methods to raise NotImplementedError, effectively disabling these methods with custom messages.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines functions and assigns methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only redefines class methods with static behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The code reassigns existing methods to functions that only raise errors; no malicious or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the stripe library, then defines two asynchronous functions that raise NotImplementedError with instructions for proper API usage. These functions are then assigned as class methods to stripe.Person. The code's intent appears to be to prevent modification or retrieval of person data via the stripe library, possibly to restrict access or enforce specific workflows. There are no suspicious behaviors such as malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The functions simply raise errors with guidance messages. No external data is read, and no sensitive operations are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code disables certain methods of the stripe.Person class by replacing them with functions that raise informative errors. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code's purpose seems to be to prevent specific API calls, possibly for security or compliance reasons.",
