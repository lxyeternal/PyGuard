  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports the `stripe` library.\n- Defines two asynchronous functions:\n  - `modify_patch`: raises `NotImplementedError` with a message guiding to use `stripe.Account.modify_person`.\n  - `retrieve_patch`: raises `NotImplementedError` with a message guiding to use `stripe.Account.retrieve_person`.\n- Assigns these functions as class methods to `stripe.Person.modify` and `stripe.Person.retrieve`.\n\n**Purpose of the code:**\n- To override the default `modify` and `retrieve` methods of `stripe.Person` with placeholders that prevent direct modification or retrieval without proper account context.\n- To guide developers toward correct API usage.\n- No data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive actions are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Issues\n\n**Are the reported issues present?**  \n- The code does **not** contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.\n- It simply overrides methods with functions that raise `NotImplementedError`.\n- No external input, data leaks, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**No security issues or malicious activity are present.** The code is a benign placeholder or enforcement mechanism.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws, Errors, or Mistakes in the Report\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code overrides methods to prevent certain actions and guides usage.\n- They note that the code does not perform data processing, external communication, or contain anomalies.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n**Note:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They do not misinterpret the purpose or behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justification & Recommendations\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- All reports assign `malware: 0`.  \n- This is correct; the code is not malicious.\n\n**Security Risk Score:**  \n- All reports assign `securityRisk: 0`.  \n- Justified; no security vulnerabilities or risks are introduced.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- All reports assign `obfuscated: 0`.  \n- Correct; the code is straightforward.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- All reports assign `0`.  \n- Appropriate, as the code does not introduce risks.\n\n**Potential for higher scores?**  \n- No, since there's no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Claims & Assumptions\n\n- The reports assume the code is a placeholder to prevent improper API calls, which aligns with the implementation.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are justified.\n- The code's purpose appears to be enforcement or guidance, not malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment & Personal Scores\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign override of methods, serving as a safeguard or guidance mechanism.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **The code does not contain any malicious or security-sensitive issues.**\n- **It acts as a placeholder to guide correct API usage.**\n- **All scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.**\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores at zero, as the code is safe and intended for usage enforcement.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always consider the context; if this code were part of a larger, suspicious system, further review might be warranted. But based solely on this snippet and reports, it is benign.",
