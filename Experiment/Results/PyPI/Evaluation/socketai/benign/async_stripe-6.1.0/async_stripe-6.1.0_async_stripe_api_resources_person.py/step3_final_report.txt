{
  "purpose": "Override the stripe.Person.modify and retrieve methods to prevent direct modifications or retrievals without proper API calls, guiding users to correct usage.",
  "sources": "The functions are assigned as class methods to stripe.Person, replacing original methods; no external data inputs or network operations.",
  "sinks": "The code raises NotImplementedError, which halts execution; no data leaks or external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Method calls to stripe.Person.modify or retrieve trigger the respective functions, which raise errors; no data flow beyond method invocation.",
  "anomalies": "The code overrides core class methods with placeholders that raise errors; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports stripe, defines async functions that raise guidance errors, and assigns them as class methods, effectively preventing direct modification or retrieval of stripe.Person objects without proper API parameters. No external input, network activity, or data leaks are present. The purpose appears to be to enforce correct API usage or restrict certain operations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is straightforward and acts as a safeguard or guidance mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a placeholder or enforcement mechanism to guide correct API usage. It does not contain malicious intent, security vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The existing reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
