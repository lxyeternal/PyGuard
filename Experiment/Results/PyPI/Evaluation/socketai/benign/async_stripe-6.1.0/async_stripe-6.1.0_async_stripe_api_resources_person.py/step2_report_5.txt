  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports the Stripe library.\n- Defines two asynchronous functions (`modify_patch` and `retrieve_patch`) that raise `NotImplementedError` with instructions on proper API usage.\n- These functions are assigned as class methods to `stripe.Person.modify` and `stripe.Person.retrieve`.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- The functions do not process any data, read external input, or perform network operations.\n- They only serve as placeholders or guards, preventing certain actions unless proper parameters are provided.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code appears to be designed to enforce correct API usage or restrict certain operations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code does not contain vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or bugs. It simply overrides methods with error-raising placeholders.\n\n### Logical or reasoning flaws:\n- **Issues:** None. The reasoning behind overriding methods to guide users towards correct API calls is sound and straightforward.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, security risk scores of 0, and high confidence levels (mostly 1). These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The purpose is consistent across reports: to prevent or guide usage, not to introduce security issues.\n\n### Justification for risk and malware scores:\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 or very close to it, as there's no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n- **Malware score:** 0, since the code does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n### Assumptions and potential vulnerabilities:\n- The code assumes that overriding methods with `NotImplementedError` is safe and intended for guidance. No assumptions about external inputs or data processing are made.\n- No vulnerabilities are introduced by this code.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports correctly score malware and security risk as 0.\n- Confidence levels are high, which is appropriate.\n- No inconsistencies detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, straightforward override of Stripe's `Person` class methods to enforce correct API usage. There are no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code does not contain any malicious activity or vulnerabilities.  \n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.  \n- No changes to scores are necessary.  \n- The purpose is to guide developers, not to harm or exploit.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores for malware and security risk, and confirm that the code is safe and intended as a usage safeguard.",
