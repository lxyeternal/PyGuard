{
  "purpose": "This code overrides methods for the Stripe API's Person class to prevent modifications and retrievals without proper account IDs, effectively providing placeholder error messages for those actions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading occurs within this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or effects, as no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The code replaces class methods with patched versions that raise NotImplementedError, preventing standard modification and retrieval operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code solely defines placeholder methods with explanatory messages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Stripe library and overrides two class methods (modify and retrieve) of stripe.Person with asynchronous functions that raise NotImplementedError with instructions. These functions do not perform any data processing or external communication; they only provide guidance on correct usage. The replacements seem to serve as safeguards or placeholders to prevent certain operations without proper context, but they do not introduce malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe modification of the Stripe API client, designed to prevent certain actions without proper parameters. There is no malicious intent, data leakage, or suspicious behavior present.",
