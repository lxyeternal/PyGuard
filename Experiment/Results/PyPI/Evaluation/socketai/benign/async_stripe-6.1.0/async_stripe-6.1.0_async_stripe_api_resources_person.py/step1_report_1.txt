{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the stripe.Person class to override the 'modify' and 'retrieve' class methods with custom implementations that raise NotImplementedError, guiding users to use specific Stripe API calls.",
  "sources": "The code reads only from imported modules ('stripe') and defines functions; it does not read external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies class methods of 'stripe.Person', but does not perform any data output, network operations, or security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows. The functions only raise exceptions and do not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code simply overrides methods with placeholder functions that raise NotImplementedError.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'stripe' library and defines two asynchronous functions, 'modify_patch' and 'retrieve_patch', which are intended to replace or override existing class methods of 'stripe.Person'. These functions only raise NotImplementedError with instructive messages. The functions are assigned as classmethods to 'stripe.Person.modify' and 'stripe.Person.retrieve'. There are no data inputs, no external data processing, and no network operations or security-sensitive actions. The code serves as a placeholder or stub to prevent modification or retrieval of 'stripe.Person' objects without proper API calls, directing users to the correct Stripe API endpoints.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It acts as a placeholder to guide correct usage of Stripe's API. No suspicious or malicious activities are present.",
