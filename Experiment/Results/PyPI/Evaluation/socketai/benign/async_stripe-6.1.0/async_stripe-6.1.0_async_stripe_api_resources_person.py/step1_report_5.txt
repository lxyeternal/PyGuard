{
  "purpose": "This code overrides certain methods of the stripe.Person class to prevent modification or retrieval of persons without specifying an account ID, providing custom error messages guiding correct usage.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or untrusted inputs are read; the code only defines functions and modifies class methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network, file I/O, or data leak points are present; the code does not perform any I/O or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "The code replaces class methods with custom methods that raise NotImplementedError, preventing certain operations; no data flow occurs beyond method assignment.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors; the code is straightforward and primarily enforces usage constraints.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the stripe library and defines two asynchronous functions that raise NotImplementedError with specific messages if called. These functions are then assigned as class methods to stripe.Person.modify and stripe.Person.retrieve, overriding the original methods. The purpose is to prevent the modification or retrieval of a person object without specifying an account ID, guiding users to proper API usage. No input reading, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code does not perform any external communication, data collection, or other potentially malicious actions. It appears as a usage enforcement mechanism rather than malware or an attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves to enforce correct usage of the Stripe API by overriding certain methods with functions that raise errors unless proper parameters are provided. There is no malicious behavior, malware, or security risk present. It is a benign implementation aimed at guiding API consumers.",
