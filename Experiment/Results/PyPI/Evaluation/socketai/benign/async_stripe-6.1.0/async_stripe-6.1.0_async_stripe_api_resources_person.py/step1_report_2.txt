{
  "purpose": "This code overrides the 'modify' and 'retrieve' class methods of stripe.Person to raise NotImplementedError with instructions for proper usage.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potential data leak points; the code only defines method overrides.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only modifies method behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual pattern of method overriding to prevent default behavior, but no malicious or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the stripe library, then defines two asynchronous functions to override the 'modify' and 'retrieve' class methods of stripe.Person. These functions raise NotImplementedError with explanatory messages directing correct API usage. The functions are assigned as class methods to stripe.Person. There are no inputs, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors. The purpose appears to be to prevent improper modifications or retrievals without proper account context, guiding developers towards correct API usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a benign attempt to enforce correct API usage patterns by overriding certain methods. No anomalies or suspicious activities are detected.",
