{
  "purpose": "The code extends the Stripe library's BankAccount class with methods to modify and retrieve bank account information, primarily to raise NotImplementedError with guidance on proper usage.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the function parameters and imported stripe library, but does not process or handle untrusted input directly.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data, output, or perform actions based on untrusted data. It only raises exceptions and assigns class methods.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the functions only raise exceptions without processing data or interacting with external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the stripe library and defines two asynchronous methods that override the 'modify' and 'retrieve' class methods of stripe.BankAccount. These methods immediately raise NotImplementedError with detailed instructions for correct API usage. The functions do not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modifications. They serve as placeholders or guidance to prevent direct modification without proper parameters. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks in this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension to the Stripe SDK, providing guidance on proper method usage and preventing direct calls that could lead to insecure modifications. There are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or security concerns identified.",
