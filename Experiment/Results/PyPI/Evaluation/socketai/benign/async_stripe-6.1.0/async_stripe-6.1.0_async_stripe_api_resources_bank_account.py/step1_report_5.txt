{
  "purpose": "The code overrides methods for modifying and retrieving bank account information via the Stripe API, providing placeholder functions that raise errors when called.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the Stripe library and potentially from method calls related to modifying or retrieving bank account data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly handle untrusted input or perform data leaks; it only raises NotImplementedError exceptions.",
  "flows": "The code intercepts calls to Stripe's BankAccount.modify and BankAccount.retrieve, replacing them with class methods that raise errors, preventing actual API calls.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious code. The code serves as a safeguard to prevent certain operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Stripe library and modifies the class methods 'modify' and 'retrieve' of 'BankAccount' to raise NotImplementedError with specific messages. This pattern is typically used to restrict or control API interactions, possibly as a security measure or to prevent misuse. The functions do not process untrusted data or perform network operations themselves. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident; the code merely overrides existing methods with error-raising stubs. No malicious payload, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with security best practices for restricting API operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a controlled override of Stripe's BankAccount methods to prevent modification or retrieval actions, possibly to enforce security or usage policies. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
