{
  "purpose": "This code defines asynchronous methods for modifying and retrieving bank account information using the Stripe API, and assigns these methods to the Stripe BankAccount class.",
  "sources": "No direct data sources such as user input, environment variables, or external inputs are used in the code.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies class methods of the Stripe library; potential sinks include the actual Stripe API calls when these methods are invoked, but this code itself does not perform any data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code replaces existing classmethods in the Stripe library with custom functions that raise NotImplementedError, guiding users on correct usage; no data flow or external data manipulation occurs within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated elements, hidden code, or unusual language features. The raise NotImplementedError messages are informative and explicitly instruct correct API usage.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as a wrapper or placeholder for Stripe API methods related to bank accounts. It overrides the modify and retrieve classmethods of stripe.BankAccount to raise NotImplementedError with guidance messages, preventing direct modification or retrieval without proper parameters. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The code does not handle or process sensitive data directly, nor does it contain any obfuscated or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a legitimate safeguard or instructional placeholder for API method usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign wrapper that prevents unauthorized or improper modification and retrieval of bank accounts via Stripe's API by raising explicit errors. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code snippet.",
