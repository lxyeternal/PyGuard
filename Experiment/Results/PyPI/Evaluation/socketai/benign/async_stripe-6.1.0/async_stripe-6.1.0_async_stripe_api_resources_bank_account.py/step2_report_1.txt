  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code's behavior, and evaluate the assigned scores.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines two async functions (`modify_patch` and `retrieve_patch`) that raise `NotImplementedError` with detailed guidance messages.\n- These functions are assigned as class methods to `stripe.BankAccount.modify` and `stripe.BankAccount.retrieve`.\n- The code is straightforward, with no data processing, external input handling, or network activity.\n- No obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious payloads are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  The code does not perform any modification or retrieval; it only raises errors. This matches the reports' description. No malicious or suspicious code is present.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical correctness:**  \n  The code correctly overrides the methods to prevent unauthorized use, providing guidance messages. No errors or mistakes are evident.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. This is accurate; no malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  The reports assign `0.1`. Given the code's nature (overriding methods to prevent certain actions), this seems reasonable as a minimal safeguard. It might be slightly elevated to account for potential misuse if these overrides were part of a larger attack chain, but in isolation, it’s benign.\n\n### Consistency and Reasonableness:\n- The reports are consistent in their assessments: the code is benign, serves as a safeguard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code does not introduce any vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n- The purpose appears to be to prevent certain API actions, which is a security measure rather than a risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (correct)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** is reasonable, considering it’s a minor safeguard, but not a security vulnerability.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, well-understood, and correctly scored. No changes are necessary.",
