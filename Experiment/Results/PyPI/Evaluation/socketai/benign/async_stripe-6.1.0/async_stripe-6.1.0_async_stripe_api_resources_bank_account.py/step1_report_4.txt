{
  "purpose": "This code defines asynchronous methods for modifying and retrieving bank account information via the Stripe API, specifically raising NotImplementedError with guidance messages.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external input or untrusted data; it primarily defines methods and raises exceptions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send data over the network or write to files; it only modifies class methods and raises exceptions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists, as the functions only raise errors with static messages.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only method definitions that raise NotImplementedError with detailed usage instructions; no suspicious logic, secrets, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Stripe library and defines two async functions to override 'modify' and 'retrieve' class methods of 'stripe.BankAccount'. These functions only raise NotImplementedError with instructions for correct usage. No input reading, data processing, or network activity is present. The code appears to serve as placeholders or stubs for future implementation, with no malicious or suspicious behavior observed. It does not contain any obfuscation, hidden code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of method overrides providing usage instructions and raising exceptions if called improperly. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities.",
