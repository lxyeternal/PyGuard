{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define methods for modifying and retrieving bank account information using the Stripe API, specifically as part of a larger library or SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it defines functions and assigns methods to the stripe.BankAccount class.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of stripe API calls; however, these are only placeholders raising NotImplementedError and do not execute any actions themselves.",
  "flows": "The flow would involve calling the class methods which raise errors, preventing actual API interaction within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code only raises NotImplementedError in its functions, with no actual data processing, external requests, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines asynchronous class methods for modifying and retrieving bank accounts, but these methods immediately raise NotImplementedError with informative messages. The methods are assigned to the stripe.BankAccount class. The code does not perform any network operations, data handling, or malicious activities. It appears to be a stub or placeholder implementation possibly intended to guide or restrict certain operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward placeholder that overrides specific methods to prevent modification or retrieval of bank accounts without proper parameters, providing guidance via error messages. There is no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks present in this snippet.",
