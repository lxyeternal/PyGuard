{
  "purpose": "Overrides the stripe.BankAccount.modify and retrieve methods to raise NotImplementedError with guidance messages, serving as safeguards or placeholders to prevent unauthorized or improper API usage.",
  "sources": "Method calls to stripe.BankAccount.modify and stripe.BankAccount.retrieve",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or data sinks; the code only raises exceptions",
  "flows": "Method invocation leading to NotImplementedError being raised; no data flow or external data processing occurs",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with clear exception messages and no obfuscation or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines two async functions that override existing class methods to prevent modification or retrieval of bank accounts without proper parameters, raising detailed guidance messages. These functions are assigned as class methods to stripe.BankAccount. The code contains no data processing, network activity, or malicious payloads. It is a benign safeguard or placeholder, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are consistent with its purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, explicit safeguard that overrides specific Stripe SDK methods to prevent improper use. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and poses minimal security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
