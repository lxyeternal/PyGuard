There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The pattern of dynamic enum extension, while somewhat unusual, is a common practice in protocol implementations and does not indicate malicious intent."

The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.01 (reflecting the deprecation warning and import style, but not a security concern). The overall security posture is safe."

The only inherent risk relates to ASN.1 parsing of untrusted data, which is a known and accepted risk in such libraries. Overall, the code is safe and benign."
