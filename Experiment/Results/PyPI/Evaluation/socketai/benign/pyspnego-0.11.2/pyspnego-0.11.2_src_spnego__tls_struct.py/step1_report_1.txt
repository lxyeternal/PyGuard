{
  "purpose": "Defines various enumerations and helper functions related to TLS protocol versions, content types, handshake messages, cipher suites, and other TLS-related constants for use in a TLS implementation or analysis tool.",
  "sources": "Reads data from enum values, class method parameters, and the input 'value' in _add_missing_enum_member; reads from class attributes and class methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data influences system state or sensitive data; primarily static definitions and type conversions.",
  "flows": "Uses input 'value' in _add_missing_enum_member to potentially create new enum members, but only for valid integer types; no network or external system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "The function _add_missing_enum_member creates enum members dynamically, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple Enum classes for TLS protocol constants, with methods to handle missing or unknown values by dynamically adding new enum members. These definitions are static and do not perform any network, file, or system modifications. The helper function _add_missing_enum_member ensures robust handling of unknown enum values, which is a common pattern for extending enums dynamically. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The code appears to be a standard enumeration setup for TLS constants, with careful handling of missing values. No suspicious or malicious code elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of static TLS protocol-related enumerations with dynamic handling for unknown values. It contains no malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It is a standard, safe configuration/definition module for TLS constants, with no security risks or malicious intent detected.",
