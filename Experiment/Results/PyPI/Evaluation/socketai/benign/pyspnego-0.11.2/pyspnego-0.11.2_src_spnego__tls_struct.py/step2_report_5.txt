  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code details, logical consistency, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** Defines TLS-related enums with handling for unknown values via dynamic member creation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.  \n- **Assessment:** The code is static, primarily enum definitions, with a helper for missing values. The dynamic creation of enum members in `_add_missing_enum_member()` is a known pattern for extensibility, not malicious. No network or file I/O, no credentials, no obfuscation.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate. Risk score of 0.0 is justified. Confidence high (0.9).  \n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, defines TLS enums with dynamic missing value handling. Slight concern about dynamic enum creation potentially hiding invalid data but standard practice.  \n- **Assessment:** No network activity, no hardcoded secrets. The pattern of creating new enum members dynamically is common in extensible enum handling.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware remains 0, risk is minimal (0.1) due to potential obscurity but not malicious.  \n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Defines extensive TLS enums, including cipher suites, extensions, distinguished names, with dynamic missing value handling. No malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- **Assessment:** The dynamic creation of enum members is standard for flexible parsing. No network, file, or malicious code.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, risk score 0.2 reflecting minor concern about dynamic member creation but not malicious.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Similar TLS enum definitions with handling for unknown values. Minor typos noted but no malicious intent.  \n- **Assessment:** The pattern of dynamic enum extension is consistent with previous reports. No network or data exfiltration.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, risk 0.1, aligning with the benign nature.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Same pattern—TLS enums, dynamic missing value handling, minor typos, no malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no network activity.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, risk 0, consistent with static, safe definitions.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports agree the code is static enum definitions with a helper for missing values, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets.  \n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports. Given the code pattern, this is correct. The dynamic creation of enum members is a known pattern for handling unknown protocol values, not malicious.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0 in some reports (0.1-0.2), justified by the dynamic enum extension pattern, which could theoretically obscure invalid data but is a common and accepted pattern in protocol handling code.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, well-structured code)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to dynamic enum handling, which is benign but slightly unusual)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured set of TLS protocol enums with safe handling for unknown values. No malicious or supply chain threats are evident. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Risk score: **0.1**",
