{
  "purpose": "Defines TLS protocol constants, content types, cipher suites, extensions, and related enums with handling for unknown values via dynamic member creation, facilitating protocol parsing and extensibility.",
  "sources": "Static enum definitions, functions for missing enum members, no external data inputs or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, no network activity, no file or system modifications; purely static definitions.",
  "flows": "Enum lookups and conversions; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic creation of enum members in _add_missing_enum_member() and _missing_ methods, which is unusual but standard for handling protocol extensions; minor typos in string labels, benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static enum classes representing TLS protocol constants, with a helper function to add missing enum members dynamically when unknown values are encountered. This pattern is common in protocol parsing to handle future or extended values gracefully. No network, file, or system modification activities are present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected. The dynamic member creation is a known pattern for extensibility, not malicious intent. Minor typos do not impact security. Overall, the code is a well-structured, static collection of protocol constants with safe handling for unknown values.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe, and well-structured set of TLS protocol enums with robust handling for unknown values. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The pattern of dynamic enum extension, while somewhat unusual, is a common practice in protocol implementations and does not indicate malicious intent.",
