  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe, and well-structured set of TLS protocol enums with robust handling for unknown values. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The pattern of dynamic enum extension, while somewhat unusual, is a common practice in protocol implementations and does not indicate malicious intent."
