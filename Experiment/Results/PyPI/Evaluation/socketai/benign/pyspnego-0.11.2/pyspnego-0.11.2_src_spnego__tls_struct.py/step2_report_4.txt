  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines TLS enums and helper functions, primarily static definitions and value handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flows; static enums and dynamic handling only for missing values.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The _add_missing_enum_member() function creates enum members dynamically but only for valid integer inputs. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe enumeration setup with no malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code) — aligns with analysis.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation) — aligns.  \n- Risk: 0 (no security risk) — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining TLS enums with handling for unknown values.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The dynamic creation of enum members could potentially obscure invalid data but is a common pattern. No external input or network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious activity detected.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — slightly elevated due to dynamic enum handling, but still benign.  \n- The report assigns 0.1 risk, which seems reasonable given the pattern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines enums for TLS and distinguished names, with dynamic handling of unknowns.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Similar to previous, dynamic enum creation is standard for extensibility. No malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware or malicious behavior.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — consistent.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — slightly higher, but still benign.  \n- The report's scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines TLS enums, with dynamic missing value handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Minor typos (e.g., 'explicit_primve') are benign. No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard enum definitions.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar pattern, defining enums with dynamic missing value handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Minor typo in 'explicit_primve' but no malicious intent. No suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — consistent.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0 — no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code. The code's pattern of dynamic enum creation is standard for handling unknown values and does not indicate malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated (0.1-0.2) due to dynamic enum handling, but this is a common pattern in protocol parsing and not inherently risky.\n\n### **My Final Estimation:**\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware or backdoors.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.  \n**Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk due to dynamic enum creation, which is a known pattern for extensibility but could potentially obscure invalid data if misused elsewhere.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured set of TLS protocol enums with safe handling for unknown values. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
