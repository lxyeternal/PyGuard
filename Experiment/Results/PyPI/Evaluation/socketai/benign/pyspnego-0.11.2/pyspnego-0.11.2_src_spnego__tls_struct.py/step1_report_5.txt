{
  "purpose": "Defines various enumerations and helper functions for TLS protocol components, including protocol versions, content types, cipher suites, and extensions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data mainly from enumeration values and method arguments; no external input sources or data parsing detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process untrusted data directly, nor does it send data over networks or write to files.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flow; the code primarily defines static mappings and enum behaviors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The function '_add_missing_enum_member' dynamically creates enum members, which is unusual but not malicious. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious logic observed. Minor typo in 'explicit_primve' which seems to be a typo but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured collection of Enum classes representing various TLS protocol components. The '_add_missing_enum_member' function enables dynamic extension of enum members when missing, which is uncommon but not inherently malicious. No external data processing, network activity, or credential handling occurs. The code appears to serve as a secure, static mapping utility for TLS parameters. The only minor concern is the typo in 'explicit_primve', likely a typo rather than malicious intent. Overall, the code does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of well-structured enum definitions and utility functions for TLS protocol handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks. The dynamic member creation is unusual but benign within this context. No suspicious or harmful code was identified.",
