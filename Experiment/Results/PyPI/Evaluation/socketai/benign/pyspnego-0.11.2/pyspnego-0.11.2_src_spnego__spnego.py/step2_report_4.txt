  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles ASN.1 encoding/decoding and GSSAPI/SPNEGO token management, including NTLM and Kerberos. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code review. The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent. The low risk score (0.2) is reasonable given the nature of ASN.1 parsing and token handling, which are inherently protocol-specific and safe if used correctly.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on ASN.1 encoding/decoding for GSSAPI/SPNEGO, including NTLM and Kerberos. No suspicious behavior or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis is consistent. The code is purely protocol handling, with no external system interactions or malicious code. The risk score remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on ASN.1 encoding/decoding, handling tokens for GSSAPI, Kerberos, NTLM. No malicious activity or sabotage detected.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The code's operations are standard for protocol message parsing and serialization, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing that the code processes tokens securely, with no malicious behavior or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe conclusion aligns with the code. ASN.1 handling is standard, and no malicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code handles ASN.1 encoding/decoding for GSSAPI, SPNEGO, Kerberos, NTLM. No malicious activity, external network calls, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous assessments. The low risk score (0.1) is appropriate given the purely protocol-focused nature.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:**  \n  None of the reports identify any actual vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation. The code is a standard implementation of ASN.1 encoding/decoding for well-known security tokens, with functions that parse and generate protocol messages.\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious activity, network connections, or command execution.\n\n- **Obfuscated:**  \n  All assign obfuscated = 0, which is correct. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard libraries.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  The risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting that the code handles protocol data safely, assuming proper usage. Since ASN.1 parsing can be risky if misused with untrusted data, but the code itself does not contain vulnerabilities or malicious logic, these scores are reasonable.\n\n- **Confidence:**  \n  High confidence levels (0.9 to 0.95) are justified given the detailed analysis and standard implementation.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (consistent with the reports)  \n\n**Note:** Given the code's nature, the scores should remain very low, as it is a standard, protocol-compliant ASN.1 handling library with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nI agree with the reports' assessments. No changes are necessary. The code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.",
