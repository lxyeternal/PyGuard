  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows**: The report states that the code handles ASN.1 encoding/decoding for GSSAPI tokens, Kerberos, NTLM, and negotiation tokens, with data flowing from raw bytes to structured objects and vice versa. No external network or file I/O is involved.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code performs standard ASN.1 parsing and token handling. The report correctly notes that ASN.1 parsing is inherently safe if implemented correctly.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: The code appears legitimate, secure, and standard for protocol handling. The confidence is high (0.9). No malware or obfuscation issues are identified.\n\n**Assessment**: The report's reasoning is sound; the code is standard protocol handling code with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows**: Similar to Report 1, focusing on ASN.1 encoding/decoding for GSSAPI tokens, including NTLM and Kerberos support. Data flows from input bytes to message objects.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No malicious or suspicious activity detected. The code is described as a standard implementation with no external side-effects.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: Again, the code is legitimate, with high confidence (0.95). No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment**: Consistent with the first report; the code is standard, safe, and protocol-compliant.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows**: Focuses on ASN.1 token processing, similar to previous reports. No external system interactions are present.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code handles token parsing and serialization safely.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: The code is a standard implementation with high confidence (0.9). No malware or obfuscation issues.\n\n**Assessment**: The reasoning aligns with previous assessments; the code is safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows**: The code processes cryptographic tokens, ASN.1 data, and mechanism identifiers. No external network activity or command execution is evident.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No suspicious patterns or malicious constructs are detected. The code is purely parsing and serialization of tokens.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: The code appears standard and safe, with high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment**: Consistent with prior reports; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows**: Similar ASN.1 encoding/decoding for GSSAPI, Kerberos, NTLM tokens, with data flow confined to parsing and serialization.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code relies on standard ASN.1 libraries and performs protocol message handling.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: The code is standard, safe, with high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment**: No signs of malicious intent; the code is a typical protocol handler.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0.0, and given the detailed reasoning, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The code is purely ASN.1 token handling, with no network activity, no secrets, no code injection, or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, and the code is straightforward, with clear structure and no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score**: All reports assign a low risk (~0.2). This seems reasonable given the code's purpose and the absence of malicious activity. The code handles protocol parsing, which inherently can be risky if misused, but within this context, it appears safe.\n\n### Final Justified Scores:\n\n- **Malware**: **0.0** — No malicious activity detected, standard ASN.1 handling code.\n- **Obfuscated**: **0.0** — Clear, well-structured code, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk**: **0.2** — Slight inherent risk due to ASN.1 parsing of untrusted data, but overall low.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. The code is a standard, protocol-compliant ASN.1 and token handling library for GSSAPI, Kerberos, NTLM, and SPNEGO, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The assigned scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the scores reflect the code's nature and security posture accurately.",
