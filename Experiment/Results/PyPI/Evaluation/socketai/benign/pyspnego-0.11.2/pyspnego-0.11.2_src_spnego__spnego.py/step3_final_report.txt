{
  "purpose": "The code handles ASN.1 encoding/decoding and token processing for GSSAPI, SPNEGO, Kerberos, and NTLM, facilitating the parsing and generation of protocol tokens without external system calls or network activity.",
  "sources": "Input bytes representing tokens, such as raw ASN.1 data, initial context tokens, and mechanism identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Parsed token objects, such as NTLM messages, Kerberos messages, or raw byte data returned when unwrapping or in case of unsupported formats.",
  "flows": "Bytes are input into unpack_token, which identifies token type (NTLM, Kerberos, SPNEGO), unpacks ASN.1 structures, and produces corresponding message objects or raw data; pack methods serialize objects back into ASN.1 bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The code performs standard ASN.1 parsing and token handling as per RFC specifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of ASN.1 encoding/decoding routines for GSSAPI tokens, Kerberos, NTLM, and negotiation messages. It correctly identifies token types, unpacks ASN.1 structures, and serializes data. No external system interactions, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The functions rely on established ASN.1 libraries and follow RFC guidelines. The code's clarity and adherence to protocol standards suggest a legitimate purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified, reflecting minimal inherent risk from ASN.1 parsing of untrusted data, assuming proper validation outside this module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of protocol token handling with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low risk score is appropriate given its function. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and compliant with relevant RFCs.",
