  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The report correctly identifies that the code handles ASN.1 encoding/decoding for GSSAPI, Kerberos, NTLM, and negotiation tokens, with data flowing from raw bytes to structured objects and vice versa.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected. The code is standard for such protocol handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that this is a legitimate, safe implementation is reasonable.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly describes ASN.1 handling for GSSAPI tokens, including NTLM and Kerberos, with no external side-effects.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior or malicious activity is detected. The code is a standard protocol implementation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report's confidence and scores are consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the assessment appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly notes ASN.1 encoding/decoding for GSSAPI tokens, handling various mechanisms.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The code is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that the code is legitimate and safe aligns with the analysis.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns; the report's scoring and reasoning are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes token processing, ASN.1 parsing, and data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a standard implementation with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly states that the code handles ASN.1 encoding/decoding for GSSAPI and related tokens, with untrusted input potentially involved.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is standard for such protocol parsers.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report's conclusion aligns with the analysis.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the detailed analysis indicating no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which matches the code's clarity and standard implementation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0 (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in ASN.1 parsing of untrusted data but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, inherent to ASN.1 parsing of untrusted input but no active threat)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent, thorough, and justified. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a standard, well-implemented ASN.1 and GSSAPI token handler.  \n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage are present.  \n- The scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as-is.",
