  "purpose": "Defines data structures, enums, ASN.1 parsing functions for Kerberos messages, mainly for decoding and debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "ASN.1 encoded bytes representing Kerberos messages, read by unpacking functions.",
  "sinks": "Structured Python objects representing Kerberos message components; no external system or network interactions.",
  "flows": "ASN.1 bytes -> ASN.1 parsing functions -> Python data structures and enums.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive set of data models and ASN.1 decoding routines for Kerberos messages, used for debugging and message analysis. It does not perform network, file, or command operations. The ASN.1 parsing is on potentially untrusted data, but this is standard for decoding libraries. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured ASN.1 decoder for Kerberos messages, used for debugging. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The only inherent risk relates to ASN.1 parsing of untrusted data, which is a known and accepted risk in such libraries. Overall, the code is safe and benign.",
