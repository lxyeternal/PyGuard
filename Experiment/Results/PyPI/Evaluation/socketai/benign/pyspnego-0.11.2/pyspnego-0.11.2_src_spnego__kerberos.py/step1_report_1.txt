{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures, enumerations, and ASN.1 parsing functions for Kerberos protocol messages used for debugging and analysis of Kerberos ASN.1 messages.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include ASN.1 encoded bytes passed to unpack functions and potentially external inputs for message parsing.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the parsing functions that decode ASN.1 bytes into structured objects and the base64 encoding functions, but there are no direct data leaks, network operations, or command executions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from ASN.1 encoded bytes (source) into structured message objects via unpack functions, with optional further decoding or representation for debugging purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution. Use of standard ASN.1 parsing and enum handling; no unsafe operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines data structures, parsing functions, and enums based on RFC specifications for Kerberos messages. It carefully unpacks ASN.1 data into Python objects, with no evidence of code injection, system commands, network communication, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be designed solely for decoding and debugging Kerberos ASN.1 messages, consistent with its stated purpose. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage, and no sensitive data or credentials are embedded in the code. The functions are read-only and do not perform any unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely a set of ASN.1 message definitions, parsing functions, and enums for Kerberos message decoding. It poses no security threat or malicious intent; it is safe for use in debugging or message analysis purposes.",
