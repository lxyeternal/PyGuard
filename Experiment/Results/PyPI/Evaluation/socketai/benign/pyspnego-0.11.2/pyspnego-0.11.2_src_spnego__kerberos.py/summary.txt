  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured ASN.1 decoder for Kerberos messages, used for debugging. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The only inherent risk relates to ASN.1 parsing of untrusted data, which is a known and accepted risk in such libraries. Overall, the code is safe and benign."
