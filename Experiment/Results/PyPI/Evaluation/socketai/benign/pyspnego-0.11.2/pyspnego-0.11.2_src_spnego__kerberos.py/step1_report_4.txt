  "purpose": "This code provides structures and parsing functions for various Kerberos message types, used mainly for debugging and unpacking ASN.1 encoded Kerberos messages.",
  "sources": "The code reads ASN.1 encoded Kerberos messages, raw byte data, and ASN.1 values from imported ASN.1 parsing functions. No external untrusted input sources are directly referenced.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include decoding and parsing ASN.1 data, which could be exploited if provided with maliciously crafted ASN.1 data. No direct network, file, or system command sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from ASN.1 encoded input bytes to structured message objects via unpack functions, then possibly to human-readable representations. No external untrusted data sources or command execution points are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code relies on standard ASN.1 parsing and data unpacking. The focus is on message decoding; no suspicious behaviors or privacy violations are evident. No obfuscation or malicious logic appears present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines numerous enumerations and data structures for Kerberos protocol messages, with functions for parsing ASN.1 encoded data into structured Python objects. The unpack functions use imported ASN.1 parsing routines, but do not perform any network or file operations, nor do they execute code based on input data. The purpose is to decode Kerberos messages, which is typical for debugging or message analysis. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present. The data flow is straightforward: input ASN.1 bytes -> parsed ASN.1 values -> structured message objects. Since the parsing relies on external ASN.1 parsing functions, the security depends on their correctness, but within this module, no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are introduced.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a structured ASN.1 parser for Kerberos messages with no evident malicious behavior or sabotage. It is intended for debugging and message unpacking, with no network, command execution, or secret handling directly implemented. The implementation appears safe within its scope, assuming imported ASN.1 functions are secure. Overall, it poses no supply chain security threat based on its content.",
