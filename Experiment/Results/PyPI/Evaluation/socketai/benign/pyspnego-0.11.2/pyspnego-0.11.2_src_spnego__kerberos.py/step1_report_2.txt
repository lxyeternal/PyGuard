  "purpose": "This code defines structures and parsers for Kerberos protocol messages, used mainly for debugging and unpacking ASN.1 encoded Kerberos messages.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include ASN.1 encoded bytes from Kerberos messages, provided to the unpack functions, and potentially external ASN.1 data that could be untrusted.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are in the unpacking functions that interpret ASN.1 bytes, especially where untrusted data is parsed into Python objects without strict validation. There are no evident data leaks, system modifications, or external communications.",
  "flows": "Untrusted ASN.1 data (source) flows into unpack functions (e.g., unpack_asn1_tagged_sequence), which then interpret data into internal objects like Ticket, PrincipalName, EncryptedData, etc. These are used solely for decoding and debugging, with no evidence of further external or system modification flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code primarily performs ASN.1 parsing and data representation. No malicious network activity, file modifications, or stealth mechanisms are detected. The code is well-structured and uses standard cryptographic and ASN.1 parsing libraries. No obfuscation, no unusual dynamic code execution, and no signs of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive ASN.1 parser and data structure definitions for Kerberos protocol messages, with extensive use of ASN.1 unpacking functions and enums for protocol constants. It only handles decoding of Kerberos messages into Python objects for debugging or analysis purposes. There are no functions performing network I/O, file system modifications, or executing external commands. The data flow is strictly confined to ASN.1 parsing and data representation. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors, are evident. The code relies on external ASN.1 libraries and standard Python modules for data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for decoding and representing Kerberos messages, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is used for debugging and introspection of Kerberos ASN.1 messages, and it does not perform any external communications or system modifications. The code appears secure and benign, with no indicators of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.",
