{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and functions for GSSAPI channel bindings, including packing and unpacking of data.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters for packing, unpacking from byte sequences, and object attributes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks; data is primarily serialized/deserialized within the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to serialization functions and back, with no external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns; the code appears straightforward and standard for data serialization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enums, helper functions for packing/unpacking binary data, and a class for GSSAPI channel bindings. The packing functions serialize the address type and associated data into byte streams, and the unpacking functions deserialize byte streams back into structured data. The class includes methods for representation, equality, and packing/unpacking. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, code injection, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a standard implementation of data serialization/deserialization for security context attributes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for managing GSSAPI channel binding data structures. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this module.",
