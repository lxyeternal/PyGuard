  "purpose": "Serialization and deserialization of GSSAPI channel binding data structures for secure context binding.",
  "sources": "Data read from internal variables during pack and unpack functions, specifically initiator and acceptor address types and data.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network transmissions; data is processed internally within the functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes through _pack_value during pack(), and from byte streams to class attributes during unpack().",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate enum value for AddressType '8' (nbs and ecma), which could cause logical confusion but not security issues.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard serialization/deserialization routines for GSSAPI channel bindings using struct packing. It employs straightforward logic without obfuscation, external calls, or malicious patterns. The only minor anomaly is the duplicate enum value, which is a data inconsistency but not a security flaw. The code does not handle external inputs beyond internal data structures, and no secrets or external effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for managing GSSAPI channel binding data. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The duplicate enum value is a minor logical issue but does not impact security. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk.",
