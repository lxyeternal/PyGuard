  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for managing GSSAPI channel binding data. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The duplicate enum value is a minor logical issue but does not impact security. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk."
