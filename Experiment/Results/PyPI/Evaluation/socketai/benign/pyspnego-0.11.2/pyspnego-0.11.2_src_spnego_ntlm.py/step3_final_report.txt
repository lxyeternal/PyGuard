  "purpose": "Import a deprecated internal module for NTLM authentication and issue a deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "Import statement from spnego._ntlm module",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, network activity, or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "None; the code only performs an import and warning",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (`*`), which is stylistically discouraged but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing only an import and issuing a deprecation warning. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious network activity are present. The wildcard import is a style concern but does not impact security. The deprecation warning indicates maintenance, not malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, deprecated import statement with no malicious activity or security threat. The use of `import *` is a style issue, not a security concern. The low risk score is appropriate given the context. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with no malware or obfuscation.",
