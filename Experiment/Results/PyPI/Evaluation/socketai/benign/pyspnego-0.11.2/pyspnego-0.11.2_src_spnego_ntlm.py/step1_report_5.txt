{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions and classes from the 'spnego._ntlm' module, likely for NTLM authentication purposes, and issues a deprecation warning about the module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a module and issues a warning.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a deprecation warning for a specific module but no other unusual or suspicious behavior, such as hardcoded secrets or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a module which could contain security-sensitive functions, but the import statement itself is benign. The deprecation warning indicates future removal but does not introduce malicious behavior. No input, data processing, or network communication occurs here. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with a deprecation warning, showing no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard warning about future removal of a deprecated module.",
