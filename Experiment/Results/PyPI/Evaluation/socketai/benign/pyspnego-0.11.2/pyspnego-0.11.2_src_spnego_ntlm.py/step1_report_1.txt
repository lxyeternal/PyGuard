{
  "purpose": "This code is a deprecated module import for NTLM within the spnego package, likely used for authentication purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports everything from spnego._ntlm; issues a deprecation warning.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output sinks present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of wildcard import (*), which can hide imported functions or variables, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from the internal module 'spnego._ntlm', which is generally discouraged due to potential namespace pollution. It also issues a deprecation warning indicating that this module will be removed in the future. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code is minimal and standard for a library deprecation notice, with no active data processing or external calls.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple deprecated import statement with a warning, showing no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a normal part of software maintenance. The use of wildcard import is a code quality concern but not a security threat.",
