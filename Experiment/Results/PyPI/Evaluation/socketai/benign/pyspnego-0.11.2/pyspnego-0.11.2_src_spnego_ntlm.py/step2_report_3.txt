  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the provided code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code imports everything from `spnego._ntlm` and issues a deprecation warning.\n- No data input/output, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- Use of wildcard import (`*`) is a stylistic and maintainability concern but not a security threat.\n- The code is minimal and intended for internal library maintenance.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Evaluation of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Deprecated module import for NTLM.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, just a warning and import.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1 (due to deprecation), confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The deprecation warning is standard; no malware or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, mainly maintenance concern.\n\n**Verdict:** The score seems reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Import NTLM functionality, likely for security/authentication.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, only import and warning.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Part of a library related to NTLM and SPNEGO, with deprecation warning.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, just import and warning.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The deprecation introduces a minor security concern (outdated module), but no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Deprecation warning for NTLM module.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; benign import with deprecation warning.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Import from `spnego._ntlm`, with deprecation warning.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, just import and warning.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusions**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malware.\n- The only concern is the use of `import *`, which is a stylistic issue, not a security risk.\n- The deprecation warning is standard and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, since the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain low, around 0.1, mainly due to deprecation concerns, not security threats.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Assessment**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to deprecation, not security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent with the code's benign nature. No adjustments are necessary; the scores reflect the minimal security concern accurately.",
