{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a library related to the SPNEGO protocol and NTLM authentication, possibly for secure network communication.",
  "sources": "Imports from spnego._ntlm module and a deprecation warning for the module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling routines are present; no untrusted data processing identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only imports a module and issues a warning.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with a deprecation warning indicating the usage of a potentially outdated module. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from a private module 'spnego._ntlm', which might be deprecated. It issues a deprecation warning but does not execute any malicious or risky operations. No data input, output, or network activity is present. The minimal nature of the code limits the risk; however, reliance on a deprecated module could be a maintenance concern. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import with a deprecation warning, showing no signs of malicious intent or security risk. It is a standard warning about library deprecation, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
