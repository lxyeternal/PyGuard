  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code snippet.\n\n**Original Code Recap:**\n```python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n# Copyright: (c) 2021, Jordan Borean (@jborean93) <jborean93@gmail.com>\n# MIT License (see LICENSE or https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\nimport warnings\n\nfrom spnego._ntlm import *\n\nwarnings.warn(\"spnego.ntlm is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\", DeprecationWarning)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code **only** performs a module import (`from spnego._ntlm import *`) and issues a deprecation warning.\n- No data input/output, network activity, or other suspicious behavior is present.\n- The import uses a wildcard (`*`), which is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n- The code is minimal and intended for deprecation notification.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Reports:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Deprecated module import for NTLM, used for authentication.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, just a warning and import.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (small, due to deprecation warning)\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues, just a deprecation notice.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Import NTLM functionality, likely for security/auth.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, just an import and warning.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No malicious or security concern.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Part of a library for NTLM/secure communication, deprecated.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, just a deprecated import.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Verdict:** Valid. No issues.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Deprecated NTLM module import.\n- **Analysis:** No data flow, network activity, or malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Import for NTLM, with deprecation warning.\n- **Analysis:** No input/output, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports agree that the code is a benign, minimal import statement with a deprecation warning.\n- No signs of malware, malicious code, or suspicious data flow.\n- The only concern is the use of `import *`, which is a stylistic and maintainability issue, not a security risk.\n\n### Adjustments & Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Correctly at 0 in all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly at 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in most reports, which is reasonable due to deprecation but not a security threat.\n- **Scores:** No adjustments needed; all are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (low, due to deprecation warning, not a security issue)\n\nThis code snippet is a standard deprecation import with no malicious intent. The deprecation warning indicates maintenance, not malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no security or malware concerns. The only critique is the use of `import *`, which is a stylistic issue but not a security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, and risk at 0.1.",
