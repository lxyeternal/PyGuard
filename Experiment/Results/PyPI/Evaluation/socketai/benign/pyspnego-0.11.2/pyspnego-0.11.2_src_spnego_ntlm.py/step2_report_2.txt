  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the scoring and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a minimal import statement: `from spnego._ntlm import *`, accompanied by a deprecation warning.\n- No data input/output, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The use of `import *` (wildcard import) is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n- The deprecation warning indicates the module will be removed in the future, which is standard maintenance practice.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Deprecated module import for NTLM.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; code is a warning + import.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard deprecation notice.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The low security risk and malware scores are appropriate. The confidence is high.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Import NTLM functionality; standard for security/auth.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; only import + warning.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, with no security concerns.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The risk and malware scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Part of library related to SPNEGO/NTLM, deprecation warning.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; only import + warning.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, minimal risk.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. The low risk score reflects the deprecation warning, but no active threat.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Deprecation warning for NTLM module.\n- **Analysis:** No data flow, no malicious activity; only import + warning.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The low security risk is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Import from spnego._ntlm, deprecation warning.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; only import + warning.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (0 or 0.1). Given the code is a simple import with a deprecation warning, this is appropriate.\n\n**Potential improvements:**\n\n- The reports correctly identify the wildcard import as a stylistic concern but not a security issue.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No evidence suggests the code is malicious or risky.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Estimated scores for this code snippet:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to deprecation warning and wildcard import, but not a security threat)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The low risk score reflects the deprecation warning and coding style, but no active threats are present.",
