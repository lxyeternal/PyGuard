{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to import NTLM-related functionality from the spnego library, likely for use in security or authentication tasks.",
  "sources": "The code imports everything from the spnego._ntlm module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are explicitly present; the code only issues a warning.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is evident as the code merely imports modules and issues a warning.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the deprecation warning for spnego.ntlm, but this is standard practice and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific module from a third-party library, which is common in security-related Python code. It issues a deprecation warning indicating that spnego.ntlm will be removed in the future, which is typical maintenance behavior. There are no signs of malicious code such as code injection, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign code snippet primarily used for importing NTLM functionality and issuing a deprecation warning. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks evident from this code.",
