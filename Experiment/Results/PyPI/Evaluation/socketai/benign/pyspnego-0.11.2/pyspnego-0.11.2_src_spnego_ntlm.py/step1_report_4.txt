{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a deprecation warning for a module related to NTLM authentication within the spnego package, likely for internal or external use in authentication workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads a warning function and imports all contents from the spnego._ntlm module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "The code imports a module which might contain sensitive functions, but no data flow or execution path is explicitly shown in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*') from a potentially large module can obscure what is imported and may cause namespace pollution. The deprecation warning suggests the module is outdated but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a submodule related to NTLM within the spnego package and issues a deprecation warning for that module. The use of 'import *' can be considered a poor practice but is not inherently malicious. No untrusted data handling, network activity, or suspicious behavior is evident in this fragment. The warning indicates maintenance or feature deprecation rather than malicious intent. Overall, the code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module import with a deprecation warning, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only concern is the use of a wildcard import, which is a stylistic issue but not security-related.",
