The warning indicates that the module is deprecated and will be removed in the future, which is standard practice. The code is minimal and does not contain any malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a deprecation notice for a module. There are no signs of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard deprecation warning in a package.",
