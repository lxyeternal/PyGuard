  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a deprecation warning with an import statement. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.01 (reflecting the deprecation warning and import style, but not a security concern). The overall security posture is safe."
