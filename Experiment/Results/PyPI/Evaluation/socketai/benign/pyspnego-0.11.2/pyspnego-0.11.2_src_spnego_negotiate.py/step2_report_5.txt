  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal import of a submodule from the 'spnego' package, accompanied by a deprecation warning.\n- No data processing, user input, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- The consistent theme is that the code is a straightforward deprecation notice with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Observations:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code only imports a module and issues a warning.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports find any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are identified; the code is standard for deprecation notices.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: consistently 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: very low (mostly 0 or 0.1 for the second report)\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Scores and Reasoning:\n\n- The **malware score** of 0 across all reports is appropriate, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** of 0 is justified.\n- The **security risk** scores are low, reflecting that this code alone doesn't pose security issues.\n- The **confidence** scores are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Potential Improvements or Adjustments:\n\n- The use of `from spnego._negotiate import *` is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution, but it doesn't imply malicious intent. The report correctly notes this as a style concern but not a security issue.\n- The second report assigns a security risk of 0.1, which might be slightly high given the context. Since the code is benign, a score of 0 or 0.01 might be more precise, but this is minor.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nGiven all the information, the code is benign, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are reasonable, but I suggest:\n\n- **Malware score:** remains at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** remains at 0.\n- **Risk score:** should be very close to 0, perhaps 0.0 or 0.01, reflecting negligible risk.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.01** (minimal, considering deprecation warnings and import practices, but not a security concern)\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: the code is standard, harmless, and serves a maintenance purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet. The scores are appropriate, with minor room for adjustment on the security risk score. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present, and the overall risk is negligible.",
