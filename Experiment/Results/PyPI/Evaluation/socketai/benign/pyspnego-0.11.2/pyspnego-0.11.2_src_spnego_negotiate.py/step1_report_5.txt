{
  "purpose": "This code imports a module related to SPNEGO negotiation, likely for authentication purposes, and issues a deprecation warning for an outdated module.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the module 'spnego._negotiate' for import statements and the 'warnings' module for issuing a warning.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the warnings.warn() function, which outputs a deprecation warning message.",
  "flows": "The code imports a module, then issues a warning; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior. The code performs standard import and warning functions with no hidden or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward. It imports a module likely related to SPNEGO negotiation and issues a deprecation warning about the module 'spnego.negotiate'. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The warning indicates the module will be removed in the future, which is typical maintenance practice.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign, serving primarily as an import and deprecation notice. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
