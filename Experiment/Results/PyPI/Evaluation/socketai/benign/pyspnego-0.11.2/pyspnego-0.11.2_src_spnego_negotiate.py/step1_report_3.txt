{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports functionality from the 'spnego._negotiate' package and issues a deprecation warning about this import.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'spnego._negotiate' module via the import statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "The only flow is the import from 'spnego._negotiate' and the warning message; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with a deprecated import and a warning. There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports everything from 'spnego._negotiate', which is a private submodule of the 'spnego' package, and issues a deprecation warning indicating this submodule will be removed in the future. The code contains no user input, no data processing, no network calls, and no potential malicious behaviors. The only noteworthy aspect is the deprecation warning, which suggests that the functionality used is planned for removal, but it does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign. It serves primarily as a deprecated import with a warning, with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
