{
  "purpose": "This code imports all functions and classes from the 'spnego._negotiate' module and issues a deprecation warning about 'spnego.negotiate'. Its purpose is to serve as a transitional or maintenance notice for deprecated functionality.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from spnego._negotiate import *' reads all public symbols from the module; the warnings.warn call issues a deprecation warning.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data; the warning is a benign notification. No data flows from sources to sinks that could cause leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The import loads symbols into the namespace; the warning is issued immediately. No data flows from external sources to sinks that could cause security concerns.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution but is not malicious. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, benign script primarily serving as a deprecation notice. It imports all symbols from a module and issues a warning. No user input, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The use of 'import *' is a style concern but not security-related. The deprecation warning is standard practice during module transitions. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected. The overall behavior is safe and typical for maintenance code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a deprecation warning with an import statement. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.01 (reflecting the deprecation warning and import style, but not a security concern). The overall security posture is safe.",
