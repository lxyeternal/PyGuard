{
  "purpose": "The code imports the negotiate module from the spnego package and issues a deprecation warning indicating the module will be removed in a future release.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from spnego._negotiate import *'",
  "sinks": "The import may load all symbols from the module, but no untrusted input is directly processed or executed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs an import and issues a warning.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of 'import *' can be considered bad practice, but it does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. The deprecation warning is standard practice for signaling upcoming removal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments, an import statement, and a warning. There are no indications of malicious code such as code injection, data leaks, or backdoors. The import could potentially load large or complex modules, but no malicious behavior is evident. The warning suggests a transition plan for deprecated functionality, which is standard in software maintenance.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily serves to import a module and warn users about deprecation. The use of 'import *' is a code style concern but not malicious.",
