  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code in question is a minimal script that imports everything from `spnego._negotiate` and issues a deprecation warning about `spnego.negotiate`.\n- No data processing, user input, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- All reports agree on benign intent, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- The use of `import *` is a style concern but not malicious.\n- The deprecation warning indicates maintenance rather than malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, all reports correctly identify that the code only performs an import and issues a warning, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or mistakes in reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports accurately interpret the code as benign and standard for deprecation notices.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malware activity is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All assign `0`, which is correct. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  Mostly `0` or very low (`0.1` in one report). This is reasonable, as the code does not introduce security risks.\n\n### Justifications for Scores:\n- The highest `confidence` is 1, reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n- The scores for malware and obfuscation are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The second report assigns a `securityRisk` of `0.1`. Given the code's simplicity, this seems slightly high. It might be better to set it to `0` for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores should be consistent across reports.**  \n  All should have `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0` unless there's a specific reason to believe otherwise.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of `0` is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Confirmed as `0`.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  Confirmed as `0`.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a minimal, benign deprecation warning and import statement. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with minor adjustments to ensure consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways monitor for future updates or changes, but based on the current code snippet and reports, there is no security concern.",
