  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code in question is minimal: it imports from `spnego._negotiate` and issues a deprecation warning.\n- All reports agree that there's no data processing, no user input, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior.\n- The only notable aspect is the use of `import *` and the deprecation warning, which are standard practices during code evolution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code does **not** process untrusted data.\n- The code is **benign** and primarily serves as a deprecation notice.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The use of `import *` is generally discouraged because it can lead to namespace pollution, but it is not malicious.\n- The code is very minimal; no errors or flaws are evident beyond style concerns.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** all reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** all assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** all are very low (0 or 0.1). Given the code's benign nature, this seems reasonable.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since there's no malicious behavior, no vulnerabilities, and no obfuscation, raising scores above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The deprecation warning indicates maintenance status, not malicious intent.\n\n### Consistency check:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code content.\n- The reasoning aligns with the minimal, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard deprecation warning with an import statement, posing no security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score.\n\n**My final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
