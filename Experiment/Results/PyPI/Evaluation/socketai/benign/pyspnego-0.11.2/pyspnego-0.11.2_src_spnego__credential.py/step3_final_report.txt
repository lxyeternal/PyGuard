{
  "purpose": "Defines various credential classes (Password, CredentialCache, NTLMHash, KerberosKeytab, KerberosCCache) and a utility function 'unify_credentials' to process user input into credential objects, filter duplicates, and support different authentication protocols.",
  "sources": "Credential class attributes (e.g., username, password, keytab, ccache), user input parameters in 'unify_credentials'.",
  "sinks": "In-memory storage of credentials; no network or file output; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "User input (string, credential objects, or list) flows into 'unify_credentials', which processes and filters credentials based on supported protocols.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. Sensitive fields are protected with 'repr=False'.",
  "analysis": "The code defines credential data classes with appropriate security measures and a function to unify and filter credentials based on protocols. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with standard credential management practices. External functions like 'is_ntlm_hash' are assumed correct. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured credential management module with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It adheres to security best practices for handling sensitive data. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
