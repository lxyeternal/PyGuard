{
  "purpose": "The code defines exception classes, error codes, feature flags, and platform-specific error handling for a security library related to SPNEGO, GSSAPI, and SSPI, facilitating cross-platform error management.",
  "sources": "Error code mappings from system errors (GSSError, WinError), class initializations, and property accessors that generate error messages.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or untrusted data flows; primarily internal error handling and message formatting.",
  "flows": "System errors (GSSError, WinError) are mapped to internal error codes via class methods, which then generate descriptive messages.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious behaviors; static class definitions and error mappings are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, cross-platform error handling module for a security library, with exception classes, error code enums, and feature flags. It safely maps system errors to internal exceptions, providing descriptive messages. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data leaks are present. The logic is straightforward, and the implementation follows best practices for error management in security contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard error handling component for a security/authentication library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The scores are consistent with its purpose and implementation.",
