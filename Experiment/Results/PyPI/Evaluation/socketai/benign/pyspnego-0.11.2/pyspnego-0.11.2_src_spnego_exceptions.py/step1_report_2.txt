{
  "purpose": "Define classes, constants, and error handling mechanisms for SPNEGO and GSSAPI/SSPI related security operations, including error mapping and feature flags.",
  "sources": "Import statements, enum definitions, class initializations, error code mappings, property accessors, and class methods.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; error handling and exceptions are standard. No system or network calls detected that handle untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flows; mostly class and error definitions without data processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. The code is primarily defining error classes and feature flags.",
  "analysis": "The code provides error classes, feature flags, and exception handling related to SPNEGO, GSSAPI, and SSPI mechanisms, including mapping system error codes to common exceptions. It does not perform network or file operations, nor does it process external input data. The use of try-except blocks, class inheritance, and error code mappings are standard and do not exhibit malicious intent. The structure and content align with typical security-related library code, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured module for handling SPNEGO, GSSAPI, and SSPI errors with appropriate error mapping and feature flags. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are detected. It solely defines exception classes and feature flags, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
