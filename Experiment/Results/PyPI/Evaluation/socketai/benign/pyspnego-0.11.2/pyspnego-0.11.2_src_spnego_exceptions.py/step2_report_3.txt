  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a comprehensive error handling module for a security/authentication library involving SPNEGO, GSSAPI, and SSPI.\n- It defines exception classes, error codes, feature flags, and mappings from system errors to internal exceptions.\n- The code appears well-structured, cross-platform, and designed for robust error management.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code behaviors are evident.\n- The code does not perform network, file, or external data operations, nor does it contain hardcoded secrets or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified; the code follows standard practices.\n- **Scores review:**\n  - Malware score: **0** — no malware or malicious activity detected.\n  - Obfuscated: **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n  - Risk score: **0** — no security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The code handles system errors safely, with fallback mechanisms for missing modules.\n- Exception classes and error code mappings are standard for cross-platform error handling.\n- The error classes generate messages based on error codes or system errors without external data leaks.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or supply chain risks.\n\n### Justification of scores:\n- The **malware score of 0** is justified, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score of 0** is justified, as the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- The **security risk score of 0** is justified, given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, well-implemented error handling module for a security library, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis supply chain report accurately reflects the code's nature. No changes to the scores are necessary. The code is safe, transparent, and aligned with best practices for error management in security protocols.",
