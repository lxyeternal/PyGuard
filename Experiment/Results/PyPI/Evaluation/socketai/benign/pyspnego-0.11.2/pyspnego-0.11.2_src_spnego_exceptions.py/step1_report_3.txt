{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes, enums, and error handling mechanisms for managing SPNEGO, GSSAPI, and SSPI authentication errors, primarily for secure communication protocols.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (enum, typing), conditional imports of gssapi.raw.GSSError, and standard exception classes; class definitions that generate errors and manage error codes.",
  "sinks": "Error handling and message formatting in exception classes, property accessors for error information.",
  "flows": "Initialization of error classes with error codes and system errors, mapping system errors to internal error codes, generating formatted error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden network activity. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation for handling security protocol errors. It maps system error codes to internal representations, provides detailed error messages, and manages platform-specific exceptions. It uses standard Python features such as enums, class inheritance, and properties. The conditional import handling and error mapping are typical for cross-platform error management. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or sabotage are present. All operations are related to error handling within security protocols, with no suspicious external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, secure implementation of error handling for SPNEGO and related security protocols. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It performs expected error management tasks without any malicious payload or suspicious activity.",
