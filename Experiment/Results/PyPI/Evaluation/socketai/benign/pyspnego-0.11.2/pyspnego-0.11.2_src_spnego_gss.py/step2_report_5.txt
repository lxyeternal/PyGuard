  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code's content, logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports all symbols from `spnego._gss`.\n- It issues a deprecation warning for `spnego.gss`.\n- No data processing, external communication, or security-sensitive operations are present.\n- The code is minimal and primarily serves as a transitional or wrapper module.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the import and warning, notes no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.1, confidence 0.9.\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score seems appropriate given the code's simplicity. The malware score is correctly zero, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the lack of untrusted data or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0, confidence 1.\n- **Justification:** Correctly identifies no security issues. The confidence is high, given the straightforward nature.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusions, emphasizing benign import and warning.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0, confidence 1.\n- **Justification:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Repeats the same reasoning, noting no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0, confidence 1.\n- **Justification:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar, highlighting the import and deprecation warning as benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0, confidence 0.9.\n- **Justification:** Slightly lower confidence but still reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of malicious activity?** No. The code is just an import and a warning, with no data flow, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Use of `import *`?** Yes, it's generally discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Any obfuscation?** No.\n- **Hardcoded secrets?** No.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?** None, based on the code snippet.\n\n### **Scores Justification:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is evident.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, around 0.0–0.1, as the code is benign and minimal.\n\n### **Summary & Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed unless future code introduces malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (minimal, mostly due to deprecation warning, which is standard practice)\n\nThis conservative estimate aligns with the evidence: the code is a benign, minimal wrapper issuing a deprecation warning, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
