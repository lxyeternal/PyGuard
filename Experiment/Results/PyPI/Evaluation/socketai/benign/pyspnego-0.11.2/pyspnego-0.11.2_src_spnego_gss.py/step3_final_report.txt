  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the internal spnego._gss module and issue a deprecation warning for spnego.gss.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from spnego._gss import *'",
  "sinks": "Deprecation warning issued via warnings.warn()",
  "flows": "Import from internal module; warning issued; no data flow or external communication",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' from a private/internal module; no malicious code or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing an import and issuing a deprecation warning. No data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The import of a private module '_gss' is typical in internal package structures and does not indicate malicious intent. The deprecation warning is standard practice for outdated modules. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores from previous reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1, obfuscated=0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The import of an internal module and the deprecation warning are standard and not suspicious. The scores assigned in previous reports are accurate; the malware score should remain 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk minimal (~0.0-0.1).",
