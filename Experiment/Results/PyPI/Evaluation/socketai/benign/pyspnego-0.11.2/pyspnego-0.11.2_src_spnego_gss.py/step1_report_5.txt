{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a deprecated module wrapper for the spnego._gss library, likely used for security-related authentication functions.",
  "sources": "Import statement for spnego._gss module, reading of the imported module, and the warning message generated.",
  "sinks": "The warning message is a benign sink; no other sinks present. No untrusted data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Import of the module, triggering of the deprecation warning upon execution; no data flows or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a deprecation warning, which indicates the code is outdated but not malicious. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation detected. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of license comments, an import statement, and a deprecation warning. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modification. The import statement imports a potentially security-related module, but this alone is not suspicious. The warning is standard for deprecated modules and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard deprecated wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a transitional placeholder and does not pose a threat.",
