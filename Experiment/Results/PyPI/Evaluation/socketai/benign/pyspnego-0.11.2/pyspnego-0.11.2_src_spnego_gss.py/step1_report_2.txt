  "purpose": "This code is part of the spnego package, likely related to security and authentication mechanisms, specifically involving GSS-API.",
  "sources": "Import statement from spnego._gss module, and a warning issued about deprecation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output, no data leak points, no direct security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily imports and warns.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only an import and a deprecation warning; no malicious or suspicious activities are evident. The warning suggests deprecation, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module and issues a deprecation warning for a submodule. There are no data inputs, outputs, or potentially dangerous operations. The warning indicates the module is outdated but does not imply malicious behavior. The code is minimal and adheres to typical software development practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports a deprecated module and warns the user. No security issues are detected.",
