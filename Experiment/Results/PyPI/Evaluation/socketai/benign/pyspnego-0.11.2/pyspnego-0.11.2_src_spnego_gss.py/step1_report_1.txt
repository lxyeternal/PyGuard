{
  "purpose": "The code is a minimal module that imports components from the 'spnego._gss' library and issues a deprecation warning for the 'spnego.gss' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from spnego._gss import *' and the warnings.warn call.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted sources is present; the only flow is the import of a library and issuing a warning.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can be considered poor practice as it may hide imported symbols, but it is not inherently malicious. The code does not perform any suspicious operations or contain hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a private submodule '_gss' within 'spnego' and then issues a deprecation warning for 'spnego.gss'. There are no data manipulations, external communications, or security-sensitive operations. The import may potentially include sensitive or internal functions, but this alone does not imply malicious intent. The warning indicates a transition or cleanup in the library's API but does not suggest malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, non-malicious module primarily performing an import and issuing a warning. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in the provided code snippet.",
