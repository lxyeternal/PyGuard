{
  "purpose": "Read input data from files or stdin and sanitize the content using the Sanitizer class.",
  "sources": "Input filenames from command-line arguments, standard input (stdin).",
  "sinks": "Output the sanitized data to standard output via print statements.",
  "flows": "User provides filenames or stdin input -> Files/read input -> sanitizer.sanitize() processes data -> Output printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. Use of external Sanitizer class is typical; no malicious actions apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and a Sanitizer class, initializes it, then reads input from command-line arguments or stdin. The input is passed through the sanitize method and printed out. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors. The code performs straightforward input reading and sanitization without any suspicious operations or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard input sanitization wrapper. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided code. It simply sanitizes input data for safe processing or display.",
