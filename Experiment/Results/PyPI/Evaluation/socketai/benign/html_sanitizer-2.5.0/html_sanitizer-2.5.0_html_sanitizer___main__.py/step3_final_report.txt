{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a command-line utility that reads input data from specified files or stdin, sanitizes the input using a Sanitizer class, and outputs the sanitized data.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for filenames, sys.stdin for standard input",
  "sinks": "print statements outputting sanitized data",
  "flows": "Input data from files or stdin flows into sanitizer.sanitize(), then to print()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected; reliance on external Sanitizer implementation is noted but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around a Sanitizer class, reading input from files or stdin, sanitizing, and printing. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or network activity is present in this snippet. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of the Sanitizer class, which is external and not provided. The code structure is simple and clear, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies. Given the absence of malicious indicators, the malware score is set to 0. The obfuscation score is 0 due to the code's clarity. The security risk score is low (around 0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk but acknowledging the unknown trustworthiness of the Sanitizer class.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning as a sanitization wrapper with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, contingent on the security of the external Sanitizer class. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and appropriate given the information.",
