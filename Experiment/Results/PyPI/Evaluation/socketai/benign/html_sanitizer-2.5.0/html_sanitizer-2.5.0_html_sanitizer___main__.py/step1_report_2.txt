{
  "purpose": "The code reads input data from files or stdin and applies a sanitization process using the Sanitizer class.",
  "sources": "Input files specified in command-line arguments or stdin stream.",
  "sinks": "Output to stdout after sanitization; potentially, the sanitize method could have hidden effects if malicious.",
  "flows": "Input data -> sanitize() method -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual language features; the Sanitizer class is imported from a local module, which could contain hidden malicious code, but the current script appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a Sanitizer object and processes input data from files or stdin, printing the sanitized output. There are no suspicious operations such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code execution within this snippet. The only concern would be the implementation of the Sanitizer class itself, which is not provided, but the code flow here is standard input processing. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are evident in this code segment. The security risk depends on the Sanitizer's implementation, but the script itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple input sanitization interface that reads data and outputs sanitized results. There are no indications of malicious intent or security issues in this fragment. The security risk is low, assuming Sanitizer is implemented securely.",
