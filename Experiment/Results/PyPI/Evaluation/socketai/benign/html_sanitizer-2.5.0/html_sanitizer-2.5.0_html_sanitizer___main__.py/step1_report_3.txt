{
  "purpose": "The code reads input data from files specified as command-line arguments or from standard input, and applies a sanitization process using the Sanitizer class.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (filenames), standard input (sys.stdin.read())",
  "sinks": "sanitizer.sanitize() method, which processes the input data; output via print()",
  "flows": "Input data (files or stdin) flows into sanitizer.sanitize(), then output is printed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys for command-line argument handling and a Sanitizer class from a local module. It initializes a Sanitizer instance. If command-line arguments are provided, it reads each specified file's content, sanitizes it, and prints the sanitized result. If no files are specified, it reads from standard input, sanitizes, and prints the result. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, command execution, or obfuscated logic. It primarily functions as a sanitization utility, likely intended to clean or normalize input data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple input sanitization utility with no apparent malicious intent. It reads data, processes it through a sanitizer, and outputs the sanitized data. There are no suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns identified.",
