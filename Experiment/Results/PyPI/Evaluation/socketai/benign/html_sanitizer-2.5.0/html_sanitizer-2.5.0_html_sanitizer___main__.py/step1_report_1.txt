{
  "purpose": "The code reads input data from command-line arguments or standard input, then sanitizes it using the Sanitizer class and outputs the sanitized data.",
  "sources": "sys.argv input for filenames, sys.stdin.read() for standard input",
  "sinks": "print statements outputting sanitized data",
  "flows": "Input data (from files or stdin) -> sanitizer.sanitize() -> print()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual behaviors observed. Usage of a sanitizer suggests data processing, but without implementation details, no malicious activity is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a Sanitizer class and creates an instance. It processes command-line arguments to read files and sanitize their content, or reads from stdin if no files are provided. The sanitized output is printed directly. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code's behavior appears to be straightforward data sanitization and output.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a simple data sanitizer interface. Without knowledge of the Sanitizer class implementation, no malicious intent can be inferred.",
