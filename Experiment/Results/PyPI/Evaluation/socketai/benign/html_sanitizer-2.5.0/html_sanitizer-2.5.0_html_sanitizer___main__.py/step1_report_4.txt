{
  "purpose": "The code reads input data either from files specified as command-line arguments or from standard input, then sanitizes this data using a Sanitizer object.",
  "sources": "Data sources include command-line arguments (filenames) and standard input (sys.stdin.read()).",
  "sinks": "The sanitized data is printed to standard output via print() calls.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from sys.argv (files) or sys.stdin through the open/read or stdin.read() calls into sanitizer.sanitize(), then outputs to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code relies on an external Sanitizer class without inspecting its implementation, which could contain hidden malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and a local Sanitizer class, then creates an instance of Sanitizer. It processes command-line arguments as filenames, reads their contents, and sanitizes them. If no filenames are provided, it reads from standard input and sanitizes that data. The sanitization results are printed directly. The code itself is straightforward and appears benign. However, because the Sanitizer class implementation is not shown, potential malicious behavior within that component cannot be assessed. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present in this snippet. The script functions as a data sanitizer pipeline, with no direct malicious actions observed in this portion.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple input processing and sanitization wrapper that, on its own, does not exhibit malicious behavior. The security risk depends on the implementation of the Sanitizer class, which is not included. No immediate threats or malicious activities are evident in this snippet.",
