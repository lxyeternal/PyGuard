  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as a comprehensive test suite for a Sanitizer class, focusing on HTML sanitization correctness.\n- They emphasize that the code operates solely on static, predefined test inputs.\n- No external data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution are detected.\n- The tests include various scenarios: attribute whitelisting, tag allowance, malformed HTML handling, entity decoding, and configuration variations.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, backdoors, or malware, are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.95 or 1.0), indicating strong agreement that the code is safe.\n- Malware, obfuscated code, and security risks are consistently scored as zero across all reports.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n\n- The code does not contain any actual malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.\n- The test inputs include potentially dangerous HTML (e.g., scripts, external entities, billion laughs) solely for testing sanitization robustness, which is standard practice.\n- The sanitizer's internal implementation is not provided, but the tests assume it is a standard, safe sanitization library.\n\n**Potential issues or logical flaws:**\n\n- No issues are evident in the reasoning or summaries.\n- The test suite appears thorough and well-structured, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n**Scores and justification:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — No malware or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — No obfuscated code or malicious hiding.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — The code is a static test suite with no external dependencies or risks.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, comprehensive test suite for a sanitization library.\n- It does not introduce or facilitate any security vulnerabilities.\n- The tests are designed to verify correctness and robustness, not to execute malicious actions.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is purely a set of unit tests, with no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or external data handling. The extensive coverage and high confidence levels support this conclusion.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe supply chain security incident report is unfounded; the code is safe, well-structured testing code for a sanitization library, with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
