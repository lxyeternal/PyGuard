  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured test suite for an HTML sanitizer, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence scores and the nature of the tests support this assessment. The supply chain security risk is minimal, assuming the sanitizer implementation is secure."
