  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content and the context of supply chain security.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a comprehensive set of unit tests for a sanitization library.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The test cases involve static HTML snippets, configurations, and assertions.\n- No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The sanitizer class (`Sanitizer`) is assumed to be a standard, presumably open-source, sanitization utility.\n- The tests include scenarios for common XSS vectors, malformed HTML, and configuration edge cases, all typical for sanitization validation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  No. The code is a straightforward test suite. It does not contain any malicious code, external data fetching, or security flaws.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as safe and standard.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk):**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and overall security risk of 0. These are reasonable given the static, controlled nature of the tests.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  The code is purely test code with no malicious payloads, no external data, and no execution of untrusted code. The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated code:**  \n  No obfuscation is present. The code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  The overall security risk is negligible. The tests do not introduce or demonstrate any vulnerabilities; they verify sanitization behavior.\n\n- **Potential assumptions or vulnerabilities:**  \n  The tests include inputs with scripts, external entities, and malformed HTML, but these are standard test cases to verify sanitization robustness, not indications of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the detailed review, the code is a standard, well-structured test suite for an HTML sanitizer. It does not pose any security threat or supply chain risk.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk in the test code itself)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is safe, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that the actual `Sanitizer` implementation being tested is secure and free from vulnerabilities, but based solely on this test suite, the supply chain risk is minimal.",
