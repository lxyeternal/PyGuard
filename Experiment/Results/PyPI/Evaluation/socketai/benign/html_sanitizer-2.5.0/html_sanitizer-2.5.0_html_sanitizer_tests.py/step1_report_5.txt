  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Sanitizer class, validating HTML sanitization, attribute filtering, and configuration behaviors.",
  "sources": "Input HTML strings in test cases; sanitizer configurations in test methods.",
  "sinks": "None directly evident; mainly test assertions comparing sanitized output.",
  "flows": "Test input HTML → sanitizer.sanitize() → output comparison; no untrusted data flows beyond test inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code primarily performs test assertions with no side effects or external network access.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of test cases validating a sanitization library. It uses controlled inputs and expected outputs, with no external data fetching, command execution, or network connections. The sanitizer configurations are set within the tests to check specific behaviors, all of which are safe. No indications of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or reverse shells are present. The code itself is standard test code; the sanitization logic, which could potentially be malicious, is not included but assumed to be a safe, open-source sanitizer. The test code contains no obfuscated, suspicious, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, controlled test cases for a sanitization library. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this test suite.",
