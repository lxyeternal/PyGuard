{
  "purpose": "Unit testing suite for a HTML sanitization library, ensuring correctness and security of HTML content filtering.",
  "sources": "Code reads no external input; only uses predefined test cases and internal class/method invocations.",
  "sinks": "Uses sanitizer.sanitize() method on hardcoded HTML snippets; no external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input HTML strings pass through sanitizer.sanitize(), which processes and outputs cleaned HTML.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. Use of third-party sanitizer library is controlled and within test context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for the Sanitizer class, verifying HTML cleaning, attribute filtering, tag allowance, and other sanitization features. No network operations, no system command execution, no data leakage, and no suspicious behavior are observed. All tests operate on static, predefined input strings, and the code itself is standard test code with no malicious intent or harmful side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a well-structured test suite for a sanitization library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or data exfiltration, merely validating sanitization logic.",
