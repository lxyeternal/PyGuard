  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for managing sanitizers in Django, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is configuration security, which is inherent in such systems. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting potential configuration manipulation if Django settings are compromised. Overall, it is safe and well-structured."
