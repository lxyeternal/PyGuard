  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve and validate HTML sanitizers configured in Django settings for sanitizing user input or content.",
  "sources": "Gets data from Django settings 'HTML_SANITIZERS' dictionary",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is being sent or processed in a harmful way",
  "flows": "Not applicable; data flows from settings to sanitizer objects, then to configuration checks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The use of cache and error handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to retrieve sanitizer configurations based on Django settings, with caching for efficiency. It handles missing configurations by raising exceptions. The check_configuration function validates the sanitizer configurations, collecting errors if any are invalid. No user input or untrusted data is processed directly. The code relies solely on settings data, which is generally controlled by the developer, not end-users.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django configuration utility for sanitization settings with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs validation of configuration data without executing untrusted code or leaking sensitive information.",
