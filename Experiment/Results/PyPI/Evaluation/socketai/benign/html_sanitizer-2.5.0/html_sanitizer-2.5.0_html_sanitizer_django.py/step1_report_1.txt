{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions and checks for managing HTML sanitizers within a Django project, including retrieving sanitizer configurations and validating them.",
  "sources": "Code reads Django settings (`settings.HTML_SANITIZERS`) to determine sanitizer configurations.",
  "sinks": "Function calls to `Sanitizer()` with user-defined configurations; potential misuse if configurations are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Settings data -> `_get_sanitizer()` -> `Sanitizer()` instances; error handling flow for invalid configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The sanitizer configuration is dynamic and could be manipulated via Django settings, but this is typical behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves sanitizer configurations from Django settings, uses caching for efficiency, and validates configurations through a check function. The flow from settings to sanitizer instantiation appears standard. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code execution pathways are present. The only potential concern is reliance on user-defined configurations, which could be malicious if an attacker modifies Django settings, but this is a standard feature of Django applications. The sanitizer class is external, so its security depends on its implementation, but this code interacts with it securely by validating configurations. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django utility for managing and validating HTML sanitizers, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The only aspect to watch is that configuration data could be manipulated if Django settings are compromised, but this is an expected risk in configurable systems. Overall, the code is safe and functional.",
