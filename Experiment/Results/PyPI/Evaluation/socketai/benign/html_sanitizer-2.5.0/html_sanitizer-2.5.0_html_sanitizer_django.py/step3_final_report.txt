  "purpose": "Manage and validate HTML sanitizer configurations within a Django application, providing cached instances for efficiency.",
  "sources": "Django settings attribute 'HTML_SANITIZERS' and external configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of the Sanitizer class with configuration data, validation errors during checks.",
  "flows": "Settings 'HTML_SANITIZERS' -> _get_sanitizer() -> Sanitizer() instances; validation flow in check_configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves sanitizer configurations from Django settings, caches sanitizer instances for performance, and validates configurations during Django's check phase. It interacts with an external Sanitizer class, which could be malicious if misused, but there's no evidence of malicious activity here. The data flow is straightforward, and no anomalies or obfuscation are present. The security relies on the integrity of external configurations and the Sanitizer implementation, but the code itself is standard and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for managing sanitizers in Django, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is configuration security, which is inherent in such systems. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting potential configuration manipulation if Django settings are compromised. Overall, it is safe and well-structured.",
