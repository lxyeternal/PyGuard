  "purpose": "To provide a utility for retrieving and validating HTML sanitizer configurations within a Django application.",
  "sources": "Settings attribute 'HTML_SANITIZERS' and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of the Sanitizer class with sanitized data; potential misconfiguration errors.",
  "flows": "Reading from Django settings -> calling Sanitizer constructor -> error handling during configuration validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. Use of caching for sanitizer retrieval appears standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches sanitizer configurations from Django settings and caches sanitizer objects for reuse. It validates configurations during app checks, raising errors if configurations are invalid. The logic is straightforward, with no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Sanitizer instantiation is based on provided settings, which is typical. There is no network activity, system modification, or suspicious data handling observed. The code operates within a controlled environment and appears to serve a legitimate sanitization purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration utility for sanitizers with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It includes proper error handling and caching mechanisms. Overall, it appears safe and intended for sanitization configuration validation.",
