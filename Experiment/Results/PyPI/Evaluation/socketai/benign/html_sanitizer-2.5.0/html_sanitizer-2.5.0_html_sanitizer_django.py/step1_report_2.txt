{
  "purpose": "The code configures and retrieves HTML sanitizers for a Django application, ensuring proper sanitization settings are used.",
  "sources": "settings.HTML_SANITIZERS and get_sanitizer inputs, particularly when accessing or retrieving sanitizer configurations.",
  "sinks": "Sanitizer instantiation (Sanitizer(sanitizers[name])), especially if the input comes from untrusted or maliciously crafted settings.",
  "flows": "Input from settings.HTML_SANITIZERS flows into _get_sanitizer, which constructs a Sanitizer object. The sanitizer is then used in the application to process HTML content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns or unusual behaviors. The code uses standard Django practices, and the sanitizer creation depends on external settings. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The use of lru_cache for caching sanitizer objects is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves sanitizer configurations from Django settings, caching sanitizer instances to improve efficiency. It raises an exception if an unknown sanitizer name is requested, which prevents misconfiguration. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or insecure data handling is present. The Sanitizer class usage depends on external input but is wrapped with proper exception handling, and there are no indications of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard and secure implementation for managing HTML sanitizers within a Django project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs configuration validation and caches sanitizer instances appropriately.",
