  "purpose": "Attempt to set version and optionally import a sanitizer module, suppressing ImportError if not present.",
  "sources": "The import statement within the 'with contextlib.suppress(ImportError):' block.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication; import is silent and does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Import of 'sanitizer' module occurs silently; no data flow or external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('from .sanitizer import *') and silent suppression of ImportError; potential to hide malicious modules or code if 'sanitizer' is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and attempts an optional import of a local 'sanitizer' module, suppressing errors. The pattern is common for optional dependencies and does not involve data processing or external communication. The wildcard import can obscure imported content but is not inherently malicious. The silent suppression could hide import failures, which might be exploited if the module is malicious. Overall, no malicious behavior or obfuscation is present; the main concern is the potential risk associated with silent, wildcard imports. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and obfuscation is absent. The security risk is minimal but slightly elevated due to the import pattern, warranting a risk score of approximately 0.2 to reflect potential concerns if the 'sanitizer' module is malicious or compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a version declaration with an optional, silent import of a local 'sanitizer' module. While the pattern is common and generally safe, the use of wildcard import and error suppression could hide malicious modules if present. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and a cautious risk score of 0.2 is appropriate to acknowledge potential risks associated with silent, wildcard imports.",
