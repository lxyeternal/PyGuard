{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set a version identifier and conditionally import a module named sanitizer if available.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leakage points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a silent import suppression with 'contextlib.suppress' is minimal but not inherently malicious; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and attempts a conditional import of a 'sanitizer' module, suppressing ImportError. This pattern is common for optional dependencies and does not include any malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no hardcoded secrets, code injections, or data leaks. The import suppression may hide missing dependencies but is not malicious per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears to be a standard pattern for optional module imports with no malicious intent. There are no security risks or malware detected.",
