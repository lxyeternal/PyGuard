  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall Code Context:**\n- The code defines a version string.\n- It attempts to import a 'sanitizer' module if available, suppressing ImportError.\n- The import is either a direct import or a wildcard import from a local module.\n- No data processing, external communication, or obvious malicious behavior is present.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the pattern as an optional import with error suppression, benign.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the pattern's commonality and benign nature.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) due to suppression pattern, but still benign. No malicious activity.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, benign, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Similar, with emphasis on the pattern's commonality and benign intent.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Slightly more cautious, noting that wildcard import ('*') can obscure what's imported, and suppression may hide errors, but no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.8, malware 0, risk 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score due to wildcard import and suppression, but no actual malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign malware score 0. The code itself does not exhibit malicious behavior; the pattern is common for optional dependencies.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The scores range from 0 to 0.2, which seems reasonable given the context. The only potential concern is the use of wildcard import and suppression, which could hide issues, but not inherently malicious.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **risk scores** for reports 2, 4, and 5 could be slightly increased to 0.3 to reflect that the pattern—while common—is potentially risky if the 'sanitizer' module is malicious or compromised, especially since the import is silent and uses wildcard import.\n- However, since there's no evidence of malicious intent, the current scores are acceptable.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code pattern itself is benign.\n- The suppression of ImportError is standard for optional dependencies.\n- The wildcard import ('*') is discouraged in security-sensitive contexts but is not inherently malicious.\n- No data leaks, external communication, or obfuscation are present.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is correct.\n- The risk scores could be marginally increased, but given the evidence, the current scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code present)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (considering the suppression and wildcard import, but no active threat)\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are appropriate, and no significant changes are necessary. The code appears safe, with only minor concerns about pattern practices, not malicious intent.",
