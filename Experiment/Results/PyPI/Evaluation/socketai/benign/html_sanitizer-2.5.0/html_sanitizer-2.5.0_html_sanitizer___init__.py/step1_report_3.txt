{
  "purpose": "This code sets a version variable and conditionally imports everything from a local sanitizer module if available.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input or external data sources are used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where data could leak or cause security issues are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from source to sink; the code only attempts to import a module conditionally.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .sanitizer import *' within a try-except block is unusual, but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a version string and attempts to import a local module named 'sanitizer', suppressing ImportError if the module does not exist. This pattern is typical for optional dependencies or internal modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code is minimal, straightforward, and lacks any suspicious or obfuscated features.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a version declaration and optional import mechanism. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
