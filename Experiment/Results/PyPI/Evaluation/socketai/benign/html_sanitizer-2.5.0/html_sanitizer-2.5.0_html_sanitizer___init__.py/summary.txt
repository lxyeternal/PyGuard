  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a version declaration with an optional, silent import of a local 'sanitizer' module. While the pattern is common and generally safe, the use of wildcard import and error suppression could hide malicious modules if present. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and a cautious risk score of 0.2 is appropriate to acknowledge potential risks associated with silent, wildcard imports."
