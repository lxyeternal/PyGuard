  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code snippet.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines `__version__ = \"2.5.0\"`.\n- Attempts to import everything from a local `sanitizer` module within a `contextlib.suppress(ImportError)` block.\n- No other code, data processing, or external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the import as optional and error-suppressed.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no anomalies, no data leaks.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, confirms pattern of optional import.\n- **Findings:** No data leaks, no suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable; the slight security risk score might be due to the silent import, but it's minimal.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, with note that the import is local and optional.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, but mentions that the pattern is common.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Highlights that the wildcard import could obscure what's imported and notes potential risks if the module is malicious.\n- **Findings:** The main concern is that if `sanitizer` is malicious, it could execute code or introduce vulnerabilities.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Verdict:** Slightly more cautious, but still no evidence of malicious activity within this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** All are zero, which aligns with the code; no malicious code is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across the board, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher in some reports due to the silent import pattern, but overall minimal.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The only potential concern is the wildcard import `from .sanitizer import *`, which can hide imported functions or objects, especially if the module is malicious or compromised. However, this pattern alone does not indicate malicious intent.\n- The use of `contextlib.suppress(ImportError)` is standard for optional dependencies and does not imply malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal risk and the pattern being common, I would set this at **0.1** to reflect the slight concern about silent imports, but overall, it's benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a simple version declaration and optional import pattern.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable.\n- I agree with the overall assessments and would maintain the scores close to what is given, with a slight adjustment to the overall risk score at **0.1**.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign, with only minor considerations about import patterns.",
