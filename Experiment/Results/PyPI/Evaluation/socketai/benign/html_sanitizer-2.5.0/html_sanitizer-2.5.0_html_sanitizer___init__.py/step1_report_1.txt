  "purpose": "Import the sanitizer module if available, suppressing errors if not present.",
  "sources": "The import statement for the sanitizer module within a try-except block.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leaks or external interactions are evident.",
  "flows": "Import attempt of sanitizer module (source) with suppression of ImportError (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of suppress context to hide ImportError; no actual code execution or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and attempts to import a sanitizer module if it exists, ignoring errors if the module is missing. This pattern is common for optional dependencies. No data processing, input/output, or external communication occurs. The import statement itself does not introduce malicious behavior, nor does it exhibit obfuscation, backdoors, or other anomalies. The suppression of ImportError is benign and standard practice for optional modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, serving an optional import with error suppression. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are detected.",
