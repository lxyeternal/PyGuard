{
  "purpose": "The code sets a package version and conditionally imports everything from a local sanitizer module if available.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own package version string and attempts to import from a relative module 'sanitizer'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks; the only source is the version string, which is static, and the import statement is conditional and local.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .sanitizer import *' with suppressing ImportError is unusual, as it may hide missing or malicious modules, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a version and attempts to import a local sanitizer module, ignoring errors if it does not exist. This pattern is common for optional dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The import suppression might hide issues, but on its own, it is benign. No obfuscation or malware indicators are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard pattern for optional local module import with version declaration. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected.",
