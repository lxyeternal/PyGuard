      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a version declaration with an optional, silent import of a local 'sanitizer' module. While the pattern is common and generally safe, the use of wildcard import and error suppression could hide malicious modules if present. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and a cautious risk score of 0.2 is appropriate to acknowledge potential risks associated with silent, wildcard imports."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard HTML sanitizer with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior. The primary concern is the simplistic URL scheme check, which could be improved for robustness but does not indicate malicious intent. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score around 0.2 is appropriate. Overall, the code appears safe for use in supply chain contexts."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for managing sanitizers in Django, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is configuration security, which is inherent in such systems. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting potential configuration manipulation if Django settings are compromised. Overall, it is safe and well-structured."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured test suite for an HTML sanitizer, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence scores and the nature of the tests support this assessment. The supply chain security risk is minimal, assuming the sanitizer implementation is secure."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning as a sanitization wrapper with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, contingent on the security of the external Sanitizer class. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and appropriate given the information."
