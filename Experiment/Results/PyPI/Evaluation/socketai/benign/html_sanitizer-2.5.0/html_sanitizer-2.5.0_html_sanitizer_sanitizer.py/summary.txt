  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard HTML sanitizer with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior. The primary concern is the simplistic URL scheme check, which could be improved for robustness but does not indicate malicious intent. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score around 0.2 is appropriate. Overall, the code appears safe for use in supply chain contexts."
