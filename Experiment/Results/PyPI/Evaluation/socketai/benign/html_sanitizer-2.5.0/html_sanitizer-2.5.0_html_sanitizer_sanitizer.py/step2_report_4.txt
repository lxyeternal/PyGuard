  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Claim:** The code is a standard, safe HTML sanitizer with no malicious intent. It uses well-known libraries, normalizes unicode and whitespace, transforms span styles, and whitelists tags/attributes. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Risk and malware scores:** 0.1 and 0 respectively, justified by the benign nature.\n- **Observation:** The code's logic aligns with the description. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious network calls are present. The sanitization routines are standard.\n\n**Verdict:** **Confirmed** that no issues are present. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Claim:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the simplistic `sanitize_href` check, which only allows URLs starting with certain schemes.\n- **Risk and malware scores:** 0.2 and 0, respectively, noting the simplistic URL check but no malicious activity.\n- **Observation:** The code performs typical sanitization, with no suspicious behaviors. The only concern is the basic URL validation, but this is not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** **Confirmed**; no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Claim:** Same general conclusion—standard sanitization with no evidence of malicious activity. The `sanitize_href` check is minimal but not malicious.\n- **Risk and malware scores:** 0.2 and 0.\n- **Observation:** The analysis correctly notes the absence of malicious code, network activity, or sabotage. The code relies on standard libraries and practices.\n\n**Verdict:** **Confirmed**; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Claim:** The code is a standard sanitizer with minimal risk, with a simplistic `sanitize_href` check. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Risk and malware scores:** 0.2 and 0.\n- **Observation:** The code is consistent with a typical sanitization utility. No hidden malicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** **Confirmed**; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Claim:** Same as others—standard sanitization routines, no signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation. The `sanitize_href` is minimal but not malicious.\n- **Risk and malware scores:** 0.2 and 0.\n- **Observation:** The logic and functions align with a safe sanitization library.\n\n**Verdict:** **Confirmed**; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, with no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports agree on 0; the code is transparent and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher at 0.2, primarily due to the simplistic `sanitize_href` check, which could be improved but is not malicious.\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear, readable, and standard.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to the basic URL validation, but overall low risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-implemented HTML sanitizer. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code, and its security posture is solid for its purpose. The minimal risk score reflects room for improving URL validation but does not indicate any malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                                  |\n|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 | No malicious code, network activity, or sabotage present.     |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 | Code is transparent and straightforward.                       |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2               | Basic URL validation could be improved, but no malicious intent. |\n\nLet me know if you'd like a detailed explanation of any specific aspect.",
