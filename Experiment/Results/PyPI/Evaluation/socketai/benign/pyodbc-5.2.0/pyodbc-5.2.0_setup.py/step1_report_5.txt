{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to configure the build process for the 'pyodbc' Python package, including retrieving version info, setting compiler options, and running the setup for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'pyproject.toml' file to extract version info; reads files from the 'src' directory; executes system commands like 'odbc_config' to gather compiler flags.",
  "sinks": "Uses system commands ('os.popen') to execute 'odbc_config' for compiler and linker flags; calls 'setup()' to initiate package build process.",
  "flows": "Reads version from 'pyproject.toml' -> sets macros and compiler flags based on OS -> runs 'setup()' with configuration -> executes 'os.popen' to fetch compile/link flags -> passes flags into build extension.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'os.popen' to run system commands for compiler flags can be a security concern if environment is manipulated, but this is standard practice in build scripts; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed; no obfuscated code or unusual control flows. The code does remove 'MANIFEST' file without verification, which could be malicious if exploited in specific contexts, but likely part of build cleanup.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs build configuration tasks, including extracting version info from a local file and setting compiler/linker options based on OS. It uses 'os.popen' to invoke system commands for compiler flags, which is typical in build scripts but could be exploited if environment variables or system commands are manipulated. No hardcoded credentials, network communication, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code does not contain obfuscated segments or malicious code patterns. Its operations are limited to setup configuration, with no indication of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard build setup script for the 'pyodbc' package with no malicious behavior detected. It performs expected tasks such as extracting version info, configuring compiler options, and invoking system commands for build flags. No malware or security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
