  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard build configuration script for 'pyodbc' with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The potential security risk is low, primarily related to reliance on external commands, which is common in such scripts. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
