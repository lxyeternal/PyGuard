{
  "purpose": "The script facilitates testing by optionally using a locally built version of the pyodbc library without installing it via pip.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (PYODBC_TESTLOCAL), file system (build directory), and the script's own location.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is sys.path insertion, which affects module import behavior; no data leaks or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Checks environment variable -> conditionally attempts to import pyodbc -> if missing, searches for build files in the build directory -> if found, prepends build path to sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The code dynamically modifies sys.path based on build artifacts, which is normal for testing scenarios.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally modifies the import path to prioritize a locally built pyodbc library for testing purposes. It uses environment variables to control behavior, searches the build directory for specific library files based on extension suffixes, and updates sys.path accordingly. The process involves standard Python modules and functions without suspicious activity or malicious intent. No external network communication, backdoors, or harmful actions are present. The code is intended for testing convenience, not malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed solely to facilitate local testing of the pyodbc library without installation. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The only potential concern is the modification of sys.path, which could be exploited if misused, but in this context, it appears controlled and purposeful.",
