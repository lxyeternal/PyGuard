  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility designed for local testing of pyodbc build artifacts. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor security consideration is the modification of sys.path, which could be exploited if the build directory is compromised, but this is typical in development settings. The existing scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) reflecting the potential for misuse of path modification."
