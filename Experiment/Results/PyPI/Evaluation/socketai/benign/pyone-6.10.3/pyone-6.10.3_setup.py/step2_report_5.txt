  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Correctly identifies the code as a setup script for 'pyone'.\n- Sources & Sinks: No untrusted data handling; purely static configuration.\n- Flows & Anomalies: No suspicious patterns, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: The code is standard, with benign version string manipulation. No malicious behavior detected.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, standard setup script.\n- Sources & Sinks: No risky data handling.\n- Flows & Anomalies: No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Standard boilerplate code, straightforward logic.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources & Sinks: No untrusted data processing.\n- Flows & Anomalies: No anomalies; version logic is simple.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Typical setup script, static data sources.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources & Sinks: No handling of untrusted data.\n- Flows & Anomalies: No suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Standard packaging code, no malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources & Sinks: No untrusted data.\n- Flows & Anomalies: No anomalies or suspicious code.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Typical setup script.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected or claimed.\n- **Risk score:** Zero across all reports, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final notes:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured setup script for a Python package.\n- No dynamic, obfuscated, or malicious code is present.\n- Version tagging logic is benign and common in package versioning practices.\n- No external data sources or sinks are involved that could pose security risks.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate; the code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
