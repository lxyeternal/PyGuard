  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'pyone' providing bindings for OpenNebula XML-RPC API.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setup, find_packages, open, path, sys; variables defining version, dependencies, and setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly handles untrusted data or user input; no data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; primarily static configuration and dependency declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward build configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It defines dependencies, versioning, author info, and package metadata without executing any runtime code that interacts with external systems or handles untrusted data. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. The code is well-structured and typical for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate, serving purely for package installation purposes.",
