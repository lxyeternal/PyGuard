{
  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'pyone' library, defining dependencies, versioning, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Static data such as version strings, package info, and dependencies; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no handling of untrusted data, network operations, or external sinks.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from variable definitions into the setup() call; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports standard modules, defines dependencies, constructs version strings based on Python version, and calls setup() with package metadata. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data. Version string manipulation is straightforward and benign. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code follows standard practices and is free of anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate safe and intended behavior.",
