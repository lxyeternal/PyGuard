  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\nAll five reports conclude that the code is a standard, benign Python setup script used for packaging the 'pyone' library. They note that the code:\n\n- Performs typical package setup tasks: importing modules, defining dependencies, setting metadata.\n- Uses system info (Python version) to determine package versioning, which is benign.\n- Does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated/malicious code.\n- Contains no suspicious patterns, secrets, or backdoors.\n\n**Confirming the code's behavior:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward setup.py script.\n- No dynamic code execution beyond standard setup configuration.\n- No external data sources or sinks that could be exploited.\n- Version string manipulation is simple and safe.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or anomalies:**\n\n- The only minor point is the version string manipulation to append pre-release tags, but this is standard practice and not suspicious.\n- No external data sources or dynamic inputs that could be exploited.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the code is a typical setup script with no malicious or security risks. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Justification:**\n\n- The code is static, with no external data processing or execution of untrusted code.\n- Versioning logic is simple and benign.\n- No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n**Overall, the package appears safe and legitimate.**",
