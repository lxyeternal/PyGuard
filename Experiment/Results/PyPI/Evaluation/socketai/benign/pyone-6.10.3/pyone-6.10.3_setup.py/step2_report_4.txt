  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library ('pyone').\n- It imports standard modules, defines dependencies, versioning logic, and calls `setup()` with package metadata.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present.\n- Version string manipulation based on Python version is straightforward.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **No issues detected** in the code; it is a typical setup script.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **None identified.** The code appears correct and follows standard practices.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code shows no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The code does not process untrusted input or perform any risky operations.\n- Version string logic is benign, merely appending pre-release tags based on version components.\n- No suspicious patterns, code injection, or external data handling.\n\n### Consistency and reasonableness:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No need for score adjustments.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are thorough and accurate; I concur with their evaluations.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the thorough reviews and the code's benign nature, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard packaging boilerplate, with no security concerns.",
