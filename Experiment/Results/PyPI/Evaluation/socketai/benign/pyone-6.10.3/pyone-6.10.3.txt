It is safe and straightforward, with minimal inherent security concerns primarily related to input validation, which appears sufficient. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting very low risk due to validation limits but no malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing utility for fixture management, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The main security consideration is the use of pickle, which introduces moderate risk if fixture files are compromised. Overall, the code is safe for use within controlled testing environments, with recommended caution regarding fixture file integrity."
