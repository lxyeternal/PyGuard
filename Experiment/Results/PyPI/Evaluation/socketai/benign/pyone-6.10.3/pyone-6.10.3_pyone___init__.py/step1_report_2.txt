{
  "purpose": "Implementation of OpenNebula XML-RPC bindings for managing and interacting with OpenNebula cloud infrastructure.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration details such as server URI, session tokens, and parameters for XML-RPC calls; processes response data from server.",
  "sinks": "Handles responses that may include XML data, exceptions, or server errors; does not appear to write or execute untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Input: server URI and session token -> XML-RPC method invocation -> Response parsing and exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "Uses custom exceptions for specific error codes; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard XML-RPC client with custom transport using the 'requests' library. It manages session tokens, constructs requests, and processes responses, including error handling with specific exceptions. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. Helper functions and constants are related to OpenNebula's API; no suspicious dynamic code execution or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate client library for OpenNebula with no malicious or sabotage behavior detected. It handles server communication securely with optional HTTPS verification, and no suspicious anomalies are present.",
