  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code details, data flows, and potential risks.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code implements a standard XML-RPC client for OpenNebula, with custom transport, exception handling, and constants.\n- It uses the 'requests' library for HTTP(S) communication, with SSL verification configurable.\n- No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present.\n- No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The data flows involve typical request/response cycles, with session tokens and method parameters.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Legitimate implementation, no malicious intent, standard patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, given the code's purpose and behavior.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly identifies the absence of malicious behavior. The high confidence (0.9) is justified.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard client library, no signs of sabotage.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Comments:** The analysis is consistent; no issues.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Standard API client, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Comments:** Correct assessment.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Typical API binding, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Comments:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Standard implementation, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Comments:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which is consistent with the code's content.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports are correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's purpose as an API client with no malicious behavior, a low risk score (~0.2) is justified.\n\n**However,** considering the overall security implications:\n- The code interacts with external servers and handles potentially sensitive session tokens.\n- The network communication relies on external inputs, but the code handles SSL verification and exceptions properly.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n**Therefore,** I would suggest the following final scores:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0.2** |\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- Malware remains at 0, as there's no malicious activity.  \n- Obfuscated remains at 0, no obfuscation detected.  \n- Risk remains low (~0.2), reflecting the potential for misconfiguration or misuse but not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, standard API client library with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Risk score: **0.2**",
