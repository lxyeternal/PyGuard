  "purpose": "Implementation of an OpenNebula XML-RPC client with custom server proxy, transport, exception handling, and constants.",
  "sources": "Method parameters, session tokens, network request payloads, environment variables (if any).",
  "sinks": "Network communication endpoints, response parsing, exception raising based on server responses.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (method parameters, session tokens) are sent via HTTP(S) requests; responses are parsed and exceptions are raised accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured XML-RPC client for OpenNebula, utilizing 'requests' for network communication with SSL verification options. It handles request construction, response parsing, and exceptions properly. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The network interactions involve session tokens and method parameters, typical for such clients. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an OpenNebula XML-RPC client. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code, and the low security risk score is justified. No further action beyond routine security review is necessary.",
