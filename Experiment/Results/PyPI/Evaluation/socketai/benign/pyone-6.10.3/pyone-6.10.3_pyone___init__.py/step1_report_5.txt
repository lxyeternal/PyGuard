  "purpose": "Implementation of XML-RPC bindings for OpenNebula, including server communication and helper functions.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters, server URI, session tokens, and request data.",
  "sinks": "Request data sent via HTTP POST, response parsing, and exception raising based on server responses.",
  "flows": "Input sources (URI, session tokens, request parameters) flow into request construction, transmission over HTTP(S), and response handling with potential exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of standard libraries and helper functions appears typical.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes an XML-RPC client with custom transport via Requests, managing server requests and responses. It handles server exceptions and encodes request data securely, with no evident malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels. No obfuscated or malicious behavior detected. The server communication logic is standard and appears to follow safe practices. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an XML-RPC client for OpenNebula, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It primarily handles server communication and exception processing securely. No anomalies or malicious patterns identified.",
