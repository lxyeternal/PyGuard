{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class 'OneAcl' that parses ACL rule strings into hexadecimal representations, validating components like users, resources, rights, and zones.",
  "sources": "Input strings representing ACL rules, such as user identifiers, resource identifiers, rights, and optional zone identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Internal processing; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are split and validated via regex, then mapped to predefined constants, and combined into hexadecimal values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward validation and parsing logic without obfuscation or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is a clear, well-structured ACL parser that converts string representations into hex values. It uses regex for validation, dictionary mappings for resources and rights, and simple arithmetic for ID calculations. No external system calls, network activity, or obfuscation are present. Error handling is appropriate for malformed inputs. The code's purpose is internal permissions management, and it does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate ACL parsing utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe and straightforward, with minimal inherent security concerns primarily related to input validation, which appears sufficient. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting very low risk due to validation limits but no malicious intent.",
