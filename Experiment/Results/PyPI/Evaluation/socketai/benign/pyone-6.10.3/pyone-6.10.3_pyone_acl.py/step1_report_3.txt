{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for parsing and managing access control list (ACL) rules related to user resource rights in a system, converting string representations into numeric hex values.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to parsing methods such as parse_users, parse_resources, parse_rights, parse_zone, and parse_rule, which receive ACL rule strings.",
  "sinks": "Returns from parsing methods converting string inputs to hex strings; no direct sinks involving untrusted data execution or network transmission are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow into parsing functions which convert them into numeric hex representations; no further untrusted data flow to external systems or unsafe operations identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. The code only performs data parsing and conversion, with proper validation of input formats. Exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically converts ACL rule strings into numerical representations using predefined constants and validation via regex. It ensures proper formatting and resource validation. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose of ACL rule parsing and does not include any network, system, or user data access outside its defined scope.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard ACL parsing utility with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It is focused on data validation and conversion without external side effects or security risks.",
