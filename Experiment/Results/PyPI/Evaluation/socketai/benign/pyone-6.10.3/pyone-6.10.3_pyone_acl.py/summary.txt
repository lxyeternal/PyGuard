  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate ACL parsing utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe and straightforward, with minimal inherent security concerns primarily related to input validation, which appears sufficient. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting very low risk due to validation limits but no malicious intent."
