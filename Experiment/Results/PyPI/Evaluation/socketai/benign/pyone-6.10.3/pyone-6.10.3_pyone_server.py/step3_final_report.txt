  "purpose": "The code determines whether to import a test or production module based on an environment variable, facilitating environment-specific configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads the environment variable 'PYONE_TEST_FIXTURE' using environ.get()",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; the code only performs a conditional import based on the environment variable",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'PYONE_TEST_FIXTURE' influences the import decision; no data flows beyond this check",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward environment variable check and conditional import",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple environment variable check to toggle between two module imports. It does not execute untrusted code, modify files, or perform network operations. The logic is standard for configuration purposes, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. The environment variable is used safely and only influences the import statement. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are present. The code's simplicity and purpose align with benign configuration practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard environment-based configuration snippet. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are accurate and justified.",
