{
  "purpose": "The code determines whether to import a test stub or the actual server module based on an environment variable, facilitating testing or production use.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'PYONE_TEST_FIXTURE' via environ.get()",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only imports modules based on the environment variable",
  "flows": "Environment variable value → conditional import decision",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code reads an environment variable 'PYONE_TEST_FIXTURE' to decide which module to import. If the variable indicates testing, it imports a tester module; otherwise, it imports the main server module. This is a typical pattern for separating test and production code. The environment variable check is standard and safe; no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward environment-based module import mechanism for testing versus production. It poses no security risks, no malicious behavior, and no obfuscation. The code appears safe and typical for development workflows.",
