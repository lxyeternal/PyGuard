  "purpose": "Helper functions for exporting marketplace applications to OpenNebula environment, including encoding, decoding, and resource allocation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'one' object methods: 'datastorepool.info()', 'marketapp.info(appid)', and app attributes like 'APPTEMPLATE64', 'TEMPLATE', 'NAME'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'b64decode' to decode base64-encoded templates and passes decoded strings to 'one.image.allocate' and 'one.template.allocate'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'one' object datastore and app info -> base64 decoding -> string concatenation -> resource allocation via 'allocate' methods.",
  "anomalies": "None detected. The code performs standard resource management operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code securely decodes base64 templates for marketplace apps and then allocates images and templates accordingly. It checks for the default datastore, handles missing datastore gracefully, and verifies the app state. All operations are legitimate API calls for resource management. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate helper module for resource provisioning within OpenNebula. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior identified. It performs standard operations related to marketplace application export, with appropriate checks and data handling.",
