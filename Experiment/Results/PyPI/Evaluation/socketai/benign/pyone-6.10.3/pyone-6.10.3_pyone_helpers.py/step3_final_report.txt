  "purpose": "Helper functions for exporting marketplace applications in OpenNebula, involving data retrieval, base64 decoding, and resource allocation.",
  "sources": "API calls to one.datastorepool.info(), one.marketapp.info(), and app.TEMPLATE['VMTEMPLATE64'], as well as base64 decoding of templates.",
  "sinks": "Allocation functions like one.image.allocate() and one.template.allocate() which create resources based on decoded templates.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API responses through base64 decoding into resource allocation functions, with no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard API interactions and template handling without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard resource management tasks: fetching datastore and app info, decoding base64 templates, and allocating images and VM templates. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious code are present. The decoding of base64 templates is typical for handling encoded data, not indicative of obfuscation or malicious intent. Error handling is appropriate, and the overall structure is straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard helper module for managing marketplace applications in OpenNebula. It does not contain malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
