  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the script is a setup for a Python package, using 'exec()' to read version info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks or external communication; the 'exec()' is controlled.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of 'exec()' is common for versioning, with no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected. The use of 'exec()' is standard in such scripts, and no suspicious code is present.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.0 seem appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence that the code is safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, reads version info via 'exec()'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** 'exec()' could be risky if the version file is compromised, but this is a common pattern.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just a cautious note about 'exec()'.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — the risk score reflects the potential danger of 'exec()' if the version file is tampered with.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. The minor risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- Same pattern: 'exec()' to read version info, standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — consistent with the previous assessments.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- Similar analysis: 'exec()' used to read version info.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- Same pattern: 'exec()' to evaluate '__init__.py' for version info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or untrusted data sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** 'exec()' is common but can be risky if the source is compromised.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just a standard setup pattern with a minor risk due to 'exec()'.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, which aligns with the analysis; no malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Zero, no obfuscation patterns present.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly elevated (0.2) due to the use of 'exec()' to evaluate potentially untrusted files, which is a known concern but common in package setup scripts.\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n- The code is a standard Python package setup script.\n- The use of 'exec()' to load version info, while potentially risky if the source is compromised, is a common practice.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — due to 'exec()' usage, which is standard but can be risky if the source files are tampered with.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The package setup code appears safe, with minimal risk associated with common practices.",
