  "purpose": "This code sets up the package configuration for Firebase Functions Python SDK, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading __init__.py to extract version information, static dependency lists.",
  "sinks": "Execution of exec() on the contents of __init__.py, potential exposure of sensitive data if __init__.py contains secrets.",
  "flows": "exec(fp.read()) reads the version string from __init__.py, which is used in setup() to define package version.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to evaluate the contents of __init__.py for extracting version info. While common in packaging, exec() can be risky if the evaluated file contains malicious code. No other suspicious code or behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and dependencies, defines dependency lists, reads package version from __init__.py via exec(), and calls setup() with package metadata. The only notable point is the use of exec() to execute code in __init__.py for version extraction, which is a common but potentially unsafe practice if the __init__.py is compromised. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious code patterns are present. The dependencies are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is typical for a setup script with minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs package setup with standard practices. The only potential concern is the use of exec() to evaluate __init__.py, which could be risky if the file contains malicious code. However, given its purpose and typical usage, it is unlikely to be malicious. No malicious behavior or malware is detected.",
