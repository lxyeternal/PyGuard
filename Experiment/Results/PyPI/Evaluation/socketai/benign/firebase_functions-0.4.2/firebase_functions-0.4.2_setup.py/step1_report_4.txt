{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package for Firebase Functions, including dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the '__init__.py' file to obtain version information, and static list definitions for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not execute or process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the only file reading is for package version, which is static.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to read and execute contents of '__init__.py' for versioning, which could be risky if the file contents are malicious or tampered with. Otherwise, the code is standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks, importing modules, defining dependencies, and reading version info via 'exec'. The 'exec' call on the version file is the only notable dynamic code execution, which is a common pattern but could be considered risky if the source file is compromised. No other suspicious or malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script for a Python package, with a potentially risky 'exec' call to read version info but no malicious behavior or security threats identified. The overall security risk is low.",
