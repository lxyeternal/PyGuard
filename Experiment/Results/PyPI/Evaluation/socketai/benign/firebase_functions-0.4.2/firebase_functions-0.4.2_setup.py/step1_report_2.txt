  "purpose": "Setup configuration for Firebase Functions Python SDK, defining dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading __init__.py to obtain version information.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external communication; setup process primarily involves file reading and package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reading version info from a file, then passing configuration data to setuptools.setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute code from a file (__init__.py) to obtain version info, which could potentially execute malicious code if that file is compromised. However, this is a common practice in package versioning and not inherently malicious. No other suspicious or malicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads package metadata, and invokes setup() for package installation. The only potential concern is the use of exec() to execute code from __init__.py, which might contain malicious code if tampered with. The rest of the code is typical for Python package setup scripts and does not contain any malicious behavior or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no clear malicious intent. The only minor concern is the use of exec() to read version information, which is common but could be risky if the source file is compromised. Overall, no malicious or harmful behavior is evident.",
