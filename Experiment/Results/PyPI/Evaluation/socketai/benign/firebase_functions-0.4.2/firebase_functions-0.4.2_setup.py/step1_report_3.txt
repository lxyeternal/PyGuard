  "sources": "Reads package version from a file, defines dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file, then proceeds with package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute code read from a file to assign version info; potential for malicious modification if version file is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package setup using setuptools, with dependencies specified explicitly. The only noteworthy point is the use of exec() to read the version number from a source file, which can be risky if that file is tampered with, but this pattern is common in Python packaging. No network connections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code does not include any obfuscated or suspicious constructs. It appears standard for package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup file for a Python package with standard dependency management. The use of exec() for version extraction, while potentially risky if the version file is compromised, is a common practice and does not constitute malicious behavior in itself. No malware, backdoors, or malicious activities detected.",
