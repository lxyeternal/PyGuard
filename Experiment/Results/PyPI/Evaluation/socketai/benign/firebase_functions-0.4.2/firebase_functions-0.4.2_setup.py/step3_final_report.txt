  "purpose": "Setup script for Firebase Functions Python SDK, configuring dependencies and versioning.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__init__.py' using 'exec()'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication; local file read only.",
  "flows": "Reads version info via 'exec()', then proceeds with setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec()' to evaluate local source file; common but potentially risky if source is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package. The use of 'exec()' to load version info is a common pattern in packaging but can be risky if the source file is maliciously modified. No external communication, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The pattern is controlled and typical, with no signs of malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, safe package setup with minimal security concern. The only potential issue is the use of 'exec()' for version loading, which is a known pattern but should be used cautiously. No malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
