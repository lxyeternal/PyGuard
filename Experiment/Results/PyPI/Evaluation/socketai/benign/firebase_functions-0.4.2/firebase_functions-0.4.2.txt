The only issue is a minor syntax bug in the error message string, which should be fixed to prevent runtime errors. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk score of approximately 0.2 is appropriate given the context."

The primary security concern is the execution of user-supplied callbacks, which is a common pattern but should be used cautiously. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the risk score around 0.2 accurately reflects the potential for callback misuse. No modifications are necessary, but caution should be exercised in environments where callbacks could be untrusted."
