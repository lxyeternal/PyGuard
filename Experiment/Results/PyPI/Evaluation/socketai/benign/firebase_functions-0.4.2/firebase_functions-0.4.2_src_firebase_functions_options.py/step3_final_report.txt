  "purpose": "Configuration module for deploying Google Cloud Functions, defining options, settings, and manifest generation logic.",
  "sources": "Parameters, environment variables (via firebase_config()), internal modules (_manifest, _util), and secrets.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted sinks; no network calls, data exfiltration, or external code execution present.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from class attributes and function parameters into manifest objects; no external data flows or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of _util.Sentinel is standard for default handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured set of data classes and functions to generate deployment manifests for Cloud Functions. It reads configuration options, environment variables, and secrets, mapping them into manifest objects. No network activity, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. The use of firebase_config() is a standard utility for configuration exposure, not malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are detected. The overall behavior is declarative and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration module for Google Cloud Functions deployment, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). The assessments in the reports are accurate and aligned with the code's purpose.",
