{
  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a license header and module metadata for a Python package related to Firebase Functions, containing licensing information, versioning, and a brief description.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is static metadata and comments.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code contains only comments and variable declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely static with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with license comments, version info, and a docstring.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static header with licensing comments, version declaration, and a module docstring. It contains no executable statements, data handling, or dynamic code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious constructs are evident. The code is standard for a Python package's metadata and licensing info, and all review reports correctly identify it as benign with no security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, metadata-only header for a Python package, containing no malicious or suspicious elements. It poses no security risks, and the scores assigned are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
