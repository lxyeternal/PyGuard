{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures and decorators for handling Firebase identity platform events related to user creation and sign-in processes, primarily for use in cloud functions to intercept and modify user authentication workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads from function parameters, imported modules, and request objects; no direct user input or untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Function calls such as 'before_operation_handler' and setting function endpoint or API attributes, which are part of the Firebase Functions SDK, not inherently insecure.",
  "flows": "Code flow involves decorators wrapping user-defined functions that are triggered by specific Firebase auth events; data flows from Firebase event data to handler functions and back through framework mechanisms.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code performs standard data class definitions and decorator setups without dynamic code execution or obfuscation. No suspicious external calls or data leaks are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides data models for user info, metadata, and event data, along with decorators for event handling registration, typical in serverless cloud function setups. No external inputs are directly processed in a malicious manner, nor do the functions perform any network operations, file manipulations, or data exfiltration. The functions are wrappers to facilitate event handling logic with configurable options. There are no signs of malicious intent, code injection, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard part of a Firebase Cloud Functions SDK, enabling event-driven user management. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is to facilitate safe event handling with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
