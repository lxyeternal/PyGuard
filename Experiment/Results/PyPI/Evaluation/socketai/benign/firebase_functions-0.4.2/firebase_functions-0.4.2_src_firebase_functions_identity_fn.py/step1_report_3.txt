  "purpose": "Define data structures and decorators for Firebase identity event handling, specifically for user creation and sign-in events.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attributes, decorator functions, and wrapped request handlers.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data from request inputs passed to handler functions, or data incorporated into responses or stored in external systems.",
  "flows": "Request data flows into wrapped handler functions, which may process or modify data before returning responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No suspicious network activity or obfuscated code present. Use of external imports appears standard for Firebase functions. No signs of data exfiltration, system disruption, or hidden malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data classes for user info, metadata, and event context, along with decorator functions to handle Firebase auth events. The decorators set attributes and call internal handlers with provided functions, without executing or injecting external code. The use of standard Firebase and Flask imports, and the pattern of wrapping functions for event handling, align with typical serverless function patterns. No suspicious code, such as dynamic code execution, network calls, or credential leaks, is present. The code appears to facilitate legitimate event handling in a cloud function environment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Firebase Cloud Functions SDK pattern for managing auth events. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
