{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures and decorators for Firebase Authentication event handling in Cloud Functions, specifically for pre-sign-in and pre-create user events.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, function parameters, request objects, and environment configuration within the decorators and data classes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present. The functions wrap external request handling and set attributes on functions but do not execute or forward untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from request inputs to internal handler functions through decorators, with no evidence of malicious data manipulation or harmful actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is primarily structural and procedural, setting up event handlers and data schemas. No obfuscated code or malicious intent indicators are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured setup for Firebase Authentication event hooks, involving data classes for user information and decorators for event handling. It imports standard and Firebase-specific modules, defines data schemas, and provides decorator functions to register event handlers. The code appears standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It leverages provided Firebase modules and typical Python patterns without any suspicious operations, external network connections, or data exfiltration logic. The use of imports and function wrappers is typical for cloud function setups.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of Firebase Authentication event handling with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows. The overall security risk is very low.",
