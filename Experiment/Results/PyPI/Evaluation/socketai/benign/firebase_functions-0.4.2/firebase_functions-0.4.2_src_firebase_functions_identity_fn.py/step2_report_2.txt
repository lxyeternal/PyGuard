  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is primarily defining data classes and decorators for Firebase auth event handling. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation. The external modules (_util, _options, _identity_fn) are not provided, but their naming suggests standard utility functions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, as the code is mainly structural.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment appears accurate. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes data structures and decorators for Firebase auth events. The flow involves request wrapping and attribute setting, typical for serverless functions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — still very low, given the nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code content; no malware or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, this code is mainly data class definitions and decorators for Firebase auth events. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The analysis is consistent; the code is standard Firebase SDK pattern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical Firebase Cloud Functions pattern, wrapping event handlers with decorators, with no suspicious data flows or behaviors.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — very low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is again data class definitions and decorators for Firebase auth event handling, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** The analysis is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, as the code is clear.\n- **Risk Scores:** Very low, reflecting the nature of the code as SDK setup and decorators.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of Firebase auth event handling. It contains no malicious logic, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.\n- The external modules (_util, _options, _identity_fn) are not included, but their usage appears typical and safe.\n- No signs of code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, mainly due to the nature of the code being SDK setup.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent with the code content, and I agree with their assessments. The code appears safe and standard for Firebase event handling.",
