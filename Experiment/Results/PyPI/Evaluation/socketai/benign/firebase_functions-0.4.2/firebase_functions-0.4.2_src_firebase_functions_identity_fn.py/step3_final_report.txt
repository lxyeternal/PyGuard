  "purpose": "Defines data classes and decorators for Firebase auth event handling, facilitating pre-processing logic for user creation and sign-in events.",
  "sources": "Request object passed to the wrapped handler functions.",
  "sinks": "External handler functions invoked within the wrapped request handlers; no direct data sinks or leaks evident.",
  "flows": "Request received -> decorator wraps handler -> internal handler invocation -> external handler execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data class definitions representing user info, metadata, multi-factor info, and event context, along with decorator functions that wrap external handler functions for Firebase auth events. No network activity, data exfiltration, code obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. External modules (_util, _identity_fn, _options) are assumed to be standard utility modules, with no evidence of malicious intent. The decorator pattern is typical for serverless Firebase functions, and the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Firebase Cloud Functions setup for handling user creation and sign-in events, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the code content.",
