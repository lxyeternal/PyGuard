{
  "purpose": "This code provides definitions and decorators for Firebase Authentication event handlers related to user creation and sign-in events, enabling custom logic before user operations occur.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and function parameters, especially the request object passed to the wrapped functions, which could contain external data.",
  "sinks": "The code calls external functions like 'before_operation_handler' and sets function attributes, which could potentially be manipulated if external inputs are uncontrolled, but no direct unsafe data sinks or sensitive data exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "Input data from requests flows into handler functions, which then invoke internal handlers and set attributes; no direct data leaks or malicious flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself appears standard and contains no suspicious hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or unusual language constructs. The function wrapping and attribute setting are typical for event handler registration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for user info and event data, and two decorators to register handlers for user creation and sign-in events. It imports necessary modules and uses standard practices for function decoration and attribute assignment. No signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection, are present. The only external interactions are with internal modules '_identity_fn' and '_util', which are presumably safe. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The use of request handling and attribute setting is typical for event-driven serverless functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate and safe implementation of Firebase Authentication event handling decorators, with no malicious or security-compromising elements detected.",
