  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report concludes that the code is a standard Firebase event handling setup with no malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, security risk is 0.1, and overall confidence is high (0.9).\n\n- **Assessment:** The code primarily defines data classes and decorators that wrap external functions for event handling. No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. The external modules (_util, _identity_fn, _options) are not included, but their naming suggests standard utility functions. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's reasoning is sound. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes the code as a structured setup for Firebase auth events, with no signs of malicious activity. Malware score is 0, security risk is slightly higher at 0.2, confidence at 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is mainly data class definitions and decorators that invoke external handlers. No suspicious patterns or malicious code. The external modules are assumed to be standard Firebase SDK components.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is consistent. No modifications necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report emphasizes that the code is mainly data schemas and decorators, with no malicious behavior. Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.1, confidence high.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent. The external functions are standard for Firebase functions. No network activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a legitimate Firebase event handler setup, with no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's purpose is to facilitate event handling via decorators and data classes. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. External modules are assumed safe.\n\n- **Verdict:** Reasoning is consistent and sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report describes the code as standard Firebase SDK setup, with no malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation. Malware score is 0, security risk is 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely structural, with no malicious patterns. No external suspicious calls or data leaks.\n\n- **Verdict:** The analysis is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily data schemas and decorators for Firebase auth event handling.\n\n- **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n- **Security Risk Scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the code's nature as event handler setup. The risk is minimal, as no dangerous operations are performed.\n\n- **External Modules:** The external modules (_util, _identity_fn, _options) are not included, but their usage appears standard and safe.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — no obfuscation or code hiding.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — minimal, based on the nature of the code.\n\n**Note:** The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured Firebase Cloud Functions setup for user auth event handling. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as they are: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk ≈ 0.1–0.2. The confidence levels are high, given the straightforward nature of the code.",
