{
  "purpose": "Defines shared utility classes and initialization mechanism for serverless cloud functions, including event data structures and an init callback system.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, and the init() function which registers a callback.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the callback function via _init_callback, which is invoked during the decorated function execution.",
  "flows": "Registration of init callback -> invocation of callback within _with_init wrapper -> execution of wrapped functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the init() function allows only one callback to be registered, which is a normal pattern. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for CloudEvent and Change, which are simple data holders. The init() function allows setting a callback to be executed before other functions run, with safeguards to prevent multiple registrations. The _with_init decorator ensures the callback runs once before the decorated function executes. No malicious or suspicious behaviors detected; the structure is standard and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility module for cloud functions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It facilitates initialization logic and event data modeling without any malicious or obfuscated behaviors.",
