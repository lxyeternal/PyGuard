  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for event handling and initialization, with no embedded malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the execution of user-supplied callbacks, which is a common pattern but should be used cautiously. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the risk score around 0.2 accurately reflects the potential for callback misuse. No modifications are necessary, but caution should be exercised in environments where callbacks could be untrusted."
