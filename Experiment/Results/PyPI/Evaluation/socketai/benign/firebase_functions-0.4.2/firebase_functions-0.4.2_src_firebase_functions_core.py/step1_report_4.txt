{
  "purpose": "Defines shared data structures for CloudEvents and change events, along with initialization control functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for dataclasses, datetime, typing, and local logger; class attributes for CloudEvent and Change classes; init() function input for callback registration.",
  "sinks": "The init() function executes a callback, potentially executing external code if the callback is malicious.",
  "flows": "The init() function stores a callback; the _with_init() decorator calls the callback once before executing the decorated function.",
  "anomalies": "Use of global variables for callback control; no validation of callback; the init() function can overwrite previous callbacks; no explicit validation or security checks on callback code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for CloudEvents and Change events, which are typical data structures with no malicious code. The init() function registers a callback to be run before other functions execute, with a warning if called multiple times. The _with_init() decorator ensures the callback runs only once before the decorated function. The callback is stored in a global variable without validation, which could potentially allow malicious code execution if an attacker supplies a malicious callback. However, the code itself does not include any malicious logic or behavior; it merely provides a mechanism for callback registration and invocation. There are no hardcoded secrets, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. Overall, the code appears to serve as a utility framework with minimal security concerns, assuming trusted callbacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility module for event data structures and initialization logic. It does not contain malicious code or behavior itself but allows external callbacks to be registered and executed, which could pose security risks if malicious callbacks are provided. Overall, the code has low malicious intent but warrants caution regarding callback trust.",
