  "purpose": "Define data structures for CloudEvents and change events, along with initialization handling.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and reads configuration via the init function and callback registration.",
  "sinks": "The init function can execute a callback; potential sink if callback performs malicious actions.",
  "flows": "init() registers a callback, which is invoked once during the first call to a decorated function via _with_init.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, or unusual code patterns observed. Use of global variables for initialization control is standard, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides data classes for CloudEvent and Change, standard event representations. It includes an init mechanism to set a callback, which is invoked once upon first use. The init function warns if called multiple times, and the _with_init decorator ensures the callback runs only once. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The callback function could be malicious if supplied externally, but this is controlled by user code and not embedded malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility code for event handling with a one-time initialization pattern. No malicious intent, no hidden backdoors, and no suspicious behavior detected. Its primary function is to define event data structures and manage initialization logic.",
