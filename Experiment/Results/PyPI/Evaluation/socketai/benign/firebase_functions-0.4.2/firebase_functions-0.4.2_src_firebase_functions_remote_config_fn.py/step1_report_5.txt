{
  "purpose": "The code handles Firebase Remote Config update events within Google Cloud functions, parsing event data and triggering user-defined callbacks when config updates occur.",
  "sources": "Reads event data from CloudEvent object (_ce.CloudEvent), specifically event attributes, data fields such as versionNumber, updateTime, updateUser details, description, updateOrigin, updateType, and optional rollbackSource.",
  "sinks": "Processes and constructs ConfigUpdateData objects, passes data to user-defined callback functions. No untrusted data is directly written or sent externally.",
  "flows": "Event data and attributes are read from CloudEvent, parsed into ConfigUpdateData, then passed into a CloudEvent wrapper, and finally passed to the user-defined callback via the _config_handler.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Code follows typical event handling structure. No insecure data handling or network actions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code properly imports necessary modules, defines data classes for structured data, and processes CloudEvent data safely. Parsing date strings and enum conversions are straightforward. The _config_handler constructs data objects without executing any untrusted code or network requests. The decorator sets function attributes but does not perform malicious actions. No anomalies such as hidden code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are observed. All data handling appears standard for cloud event processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical Firebase Cloud Function event handler for Remote Config updates. It performs safe parsing and callback invocation without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. There are no indicators of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities within this module.",
