{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to handle Firebase Remote Config update events in Google Cloud Functions, parsing event data and triggering user-defined callback functions.",
  "sources": "Reads event data from CloudEvent objects, including 'versionNumber', 'updateTime', 'updateUser' details, 'description', 'updateOrigin', 'updateType', and optional 'rollbackSource'.",
  "sinks": "Data is used to construct CloudEvent objects and invoke callback functions; no explicit data sinks or external data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Event data is retrieved from CloudEvent, parsed into ConfigUpdateData object, then passed to user-defined callback functions via wrapped handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly handles event data parsing, object construction, and callback invocation. It imports well-known modules, utilizes standard parsing methods, and does not perform network operations, file access, or other suspicious actions. The functions are typical for event-driven serverless architectures. No indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for handling Firebase Remote Config update events in cloud functions. It follows standard practices without any malicious or suspicious components. The overall security risk is minimal.",
