{
  "purpose": "Handles Firebase Remote Config update events by parsing event data into structured objects and invoking user-defined callbacks.",
  "sources": "Event data payload (versionNumber, updateTime, updateUser, description, updateOrigin, updateType, rollbackSource) and event attributes (id, source, specversion, subject, time, type).",
  "sinks": "Callback functions that process the structured CloudEvent; no external data leaks or network calls observed.",
  "flows": "Event data and attributes are combined into a dictionary, parsed into ConfigUpdateData, then wrapped into a CloudEvent object, which is passed to the user callback.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Firebase Cloud Function handler for Remote Config updates. It parses event data into data classes, constructs a CloudEvent object, and invokes a callback. No external network activity, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The data handling (dates, enums, user info) is standard and safe. The code structure is clear, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Firebase Remote Config event handler with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and low security risk (around 0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
