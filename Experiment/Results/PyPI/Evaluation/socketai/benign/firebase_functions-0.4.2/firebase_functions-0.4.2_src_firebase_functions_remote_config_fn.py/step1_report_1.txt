{
  "purpose": "The code defines cloud functions to handle Firebase Remote Config update events, including data parsing and event handling setup.",
  "sources": "Reads event data from CloudEvent objects, specifically from the event's data payload and attributes such as 'versionNumber', 'updateTime', 'updateUser', 'description', 'updateOrigin', 'updateType', and 'rollbackSource'.",
  "sinks": "Data is used to construct ConfigUpdateData and CloudEvent objects; no external data sinks or network connections are evident in the code.",
  "flows": "Event data is extracted from CloudEvent, parsed into structured data objects, and passed to user-defined callback functions via a decorator, with no external data transmission or execution flow outside internal handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the code strictly handles event data parsing and decorator setup. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. No unsafe data handling or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and Firebase-specific modules to process remote config update events. It defines data classes to model user and update data, and provides a decorator to register event handlers. The core function '_config_handler' parses event payloads into structured data, constructing 'ConfigUpdateData' and 'CloudEvent' objects. The decorator 'on_config_updated' sets up event handling with specified options. All data handling is straightforward and pertains solely to event processing; no external calls, network activities, or suspicious code segments are identified. The code appears to be standard event handling boilerplate without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Firebase Remote Config event handler setup module with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely to parse and handle remote config update events in a secure and standard manner.",
