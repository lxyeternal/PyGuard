{
  "purpose": "The code provides event handlers for Google Cloud Storage events, allowing users to trigger functions based on object changes such as creation, deletion, archiving, and metadata updates.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from CloudEvent objects, which originate from Google Cloud Storage event notifications.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present in this code; it primarily processes incoming event data and passes it to user-defined callback functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CloudEvent data into StorageObjectData instances, which are then passed to user-defined functions through the event handler wrappers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code appears standard for handling CloudEvents with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines data classes for storage object metadata, along with functions to handle various Cloud Storage events. It securely parses event data, converts timestamps, and invokes user-defined callbacks without any unsafe operations. There are no signs of code obfuscation, malicious data exfiltration, or malicious behavior such as network connections or system modifications. The functions utilize decorators and utility methods for event registration, and the overall structure aligns with typical serverless event handler patterns. No hardcoded secrets, credential handling, or insecure code constructs are present. The code does not include any code injection, data leakage, or malware-like activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of event handlers for Google Cloud Storage events with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
