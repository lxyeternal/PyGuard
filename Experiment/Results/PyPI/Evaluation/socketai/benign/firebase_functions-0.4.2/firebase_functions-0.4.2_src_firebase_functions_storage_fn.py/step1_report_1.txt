{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to handle Google Cloud Storage events in Firebase functions, such as object creation, deletion, archiving, and metadata updates.",
  "sources": "The code reads event data from Google Cloud Storage event payloads and environment variables for function configuration.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks that could lead to data leaks or security effects. It primarily processes event data and sets up event handlers.",
  "flows": "Event data is received from CloudEvents, parsed into StorageObjectData objects, and passed to user-defined callback functions. The flow is from CloudEvent input to user callback execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is mainly standard event handler setup with data parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures for Cloud Storage events and functions to register event handlers for different storage events (archived, finalized, deleted, metadata updated). It uses standard Python libraries and Firebase utilities for setting up these handlers. No untrusted external input is processed beyond standard event data. No code execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured Firebase Cloud Functions library for storage event handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Firebase Cloud Storage event handlers with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues. It does not include any suspicious behavior or malware. The overall security risk is very low.",
