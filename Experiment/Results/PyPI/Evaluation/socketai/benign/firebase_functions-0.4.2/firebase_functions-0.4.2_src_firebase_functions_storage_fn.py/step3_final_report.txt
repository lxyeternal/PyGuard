{
  "purpose": "Handle Google Cloud Storage events within Firebase functions, processing event data and invoking user-defined callbacks.",
  "sources": "Event data received from CloudEvent payload, specifically the 'data' dictionary containing storage object details.",
  "sinks": "User-defined callback functions invoked with the constructed CloudEvent object; no external sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Event data is parsed from the CloudEvent payload into StorageObjectData, then wrapped into a CloudEvent object, which is passed to the user callback.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard data parsing and decorator-based event registration.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Firebase Cloud Storage event handlers, parsing event data into data classes, and registering callbacks via decorators. No suspicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The data parsing is direct, with no obfuscation or unsafe operations. The code relies on external libraries for event handling but does not perform any malicious actions or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured Firebase Cloud Storage event handler library with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score of 0.1 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
