  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured Firebase Cloud Storage event handler library with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score of 0.1 are justified and consistent with the analysis."
