{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a setup script for packaging a Python library named 'bangla', providing metadata and configuration for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads static 'README.rst' file; no external or untrusted data sources; no network or dynamic data input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Reads static file -> passes metadata to setup() -> completes package configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward, standard setup script with no obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools', defines a function to read a local README file with UTF-8 encoding, and calls 'setup()' with static package metadata. It performs no network activity, no dynamic code, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the benign, standard nature of this setup.py. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security concerns. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent.",
