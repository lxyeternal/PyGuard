{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python library called 'bangla'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.rst file for long description and metadata from variables such as name, version, description, classifiers, keywords, url, author, author_email, license, and packages.",
  "sinks": "The script itself does not contain any sinks that execute untrusted data or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading a README file to include as long_description, then passing metadata to setuptools.setup() for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be a standard setup.py script with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and io modules, defines a function to read a README file with specified encoding, then calls setup() with package metadata including name, version, description, dependencies, classifiers, keywords, URL, author details, license, and package list. There are no dynamic executions, input/output operations beyond reading the README, or any suspicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are present.",
