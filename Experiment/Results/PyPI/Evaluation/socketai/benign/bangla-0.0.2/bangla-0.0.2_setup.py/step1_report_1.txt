  "purpose": "To set up and configure a Python package named 'bangla' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file for long description; retrieving package metadata for setup.",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data sinks or external data processing; no network or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input from README.rst (static file read), used solely for package description; no flow to any sink involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs observed. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The code is straightforward package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and defines a function to read a local README file, which is used in the package's long description. The setup() call contains standard package metadata such as name, version, description, classifiers, author info, and package data. No dynamic code execution, external network access, or malicious logic detected. The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and solely responsible for package distribution setup.",
