  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'bangla', including metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.rst' file for long description, uses static strings for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no external data or inputs processed beyond reading a static file.",
  "flows": "Reads static file content to populate long_description; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. Usage of standard setup tools and static strings.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration script employing 'setuptools'. It reads a README file with utf8 encoding, which is normal, and defines package metadata. There are no dynamic or external inputs, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network or system calls. The code appears to be straightforward and intended for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely specifies package information for distribution.",
