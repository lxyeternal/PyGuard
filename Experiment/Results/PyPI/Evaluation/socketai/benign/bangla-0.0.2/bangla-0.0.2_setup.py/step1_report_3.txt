  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'bangla' Python package, providing package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file for long description using io.open('README.rst')",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no network, file write, or environment variable manipulations observed.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is from reading 'README.rst' into the package description; no untrusted input flows to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. Use of standard setup tools and straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package configuration and reads a README file for long description. It specifies package metadata, dependencies (none), classifiers, keywords, URLs, author info, and package inclusion. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or security-sensitive operations are present. The readme reading is a common practice and does not pose a security risk. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library, with no malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks observed.",
