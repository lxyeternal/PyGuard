  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The confidence is high (1). The malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it states the code is a straightforward setup script with no suspicious behavior. Confidence is 1, malware score 0.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The code appears safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Also finds the code to be a typical setup script, with no anomalies or malicious behavior. Confidence is 1, malware score 0.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—standard setup script, no malicious activity, no obfuscation, no suspicious code. Confidence is 1, malware score 0.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with others, standard package setup code, no anomalies, no malicious behavior. Confidence is 1, malware score 0.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports.\n- **Security risks:** None identified.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the code is purely configuration for package distribution.\n\n### Final Justification:\nAll reports agree that this is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The consistent scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis package setup code is entirely safe and typical for Python packaging.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard setup.py script with no malicious or security concerns. The provided reports are accurate and comprehensive.",
