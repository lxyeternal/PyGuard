{
  "purpose": "This code converts Gregorian dates to Bangla dates, including details like year, month, weekday, and season.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current date via datetime.date.today() if no input is provided, and takes passed date, month, and year parameters.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that send data to external systems or networks; the code performs local calculations and conversions only.",
  "flows": "The date input flows through functions to determine weekday, year, and Bangla date components, but all processing remains local without external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The only dynamic external interaction is the optional use of current date, which is standard. No obfuscated code, misleading variables, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script utilizes standard libraries and straightforward date conversions without any code obfuscation. Functions are clearly defined for leap year checking, Bangla year calculation, weekday retrieval, and digit conversion. No external network calls or hidden behaviors are observed. The date calculation logic aligns with typical calendar conversion algorithms. The code appears to serve a purely functional purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign date conversion utility with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs local computations to convert Gregorian dates into Bangla calendar details. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
