  "purpose": "Convert Gregorian dates to Bangla calendar dates, including weekday, month, year, season, and digit translation into Bangla script.",
  "sources": "Input parameters passed to get_date() (date, month, year), system date via datetime.date.today() when no parameters provided.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or file I/O involved.",
  "flows": "Input parameters or system date -> date calculations and conversions -> output dictionary with Bangla date components.",
  "anomalies": "Use of system date without validation; no exception handling; straightforward logic with no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard date conversions from Gregorian to Bangla calendar, handling leap years, seasons, and digit conversions. It uses Python's datetime library safely, with no external communication or obfuscation. The functions are transparent, and the logic aligns with calendar calculations. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward date conversion utility with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
