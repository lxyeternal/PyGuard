  "purpose": "The code converts Gregorian dates to Bangla (Bengali) calendar dates, including date, month, year, season, and weekday in Bangla script.",
  "sources": "Reads current system date using datetime.date.today() or uses passed date, month, and year parameters.",
  "sinks": "Uses datetime.datetime for date calculations; converts digits and weekdays to Bangla; no direct data sinks or untrusted data flows present.",
  "flows": "Source (system date or input parameters) to date calculations and conversions; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The functions are straightforward, and the code performs date conversions without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides date conversion functionalities with no indications of malicious behavior. It reads system date data in a safe manner and performs mathematical calculations and string conversions locally. There are no network communications, data leaks, or code injections. The code does not perform any suspicious operations like system manipulation or data exfiltration. The logic is consistent with date conversion tasks, and no anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign date conversion utility with no malicious activity or security risks detected. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior; it simply performs calendar calculations and translations into Bangla script.",
