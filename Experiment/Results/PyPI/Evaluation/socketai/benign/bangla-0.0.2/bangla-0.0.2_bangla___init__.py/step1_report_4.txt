{
  "purpose": "This code converts Gregorian dates to Bangla (Bengali) calendar dates, including week days, months, seasons, and year calculation, and converts digits to Bangla numerals.",
  "sources": "The code reads system date/time using datetime.datetime and datetime.date functions. It also processes function parameters passed by the user for specific date components.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks involved; no output to external systems, no network activity, no file I/O, or external calls observed.",
  "flows": "Input dates are taken from parameters or current system date; data flows through conversion functions to produce Bangla date components, which are then formatted and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No dynamic code execution or external system calls detected. The code strictly performs date calculations and string manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements date conversion logic from Gregorian to Bangla calendar, including leap year checks and date adjustments. All functions are straightforward and use standard Python modules and simple arithmetic. There are no signs of malicious intent, no external network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code does not handle sensitive data or perform any harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign date conversion utility focusing on calendar translation and digit conversion. It does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. The code appears secure and free of malware or malicious intent.",
