{
  "purpose": "The code converts Gregorian dates to Bangla (Bengali) calendar dates, including handling leap years, weekdays, seasons, and date formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads input dates through function parameters passed to get_date(). It also accesses system date via datetime.date.today() when no input is provided.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems, network, or storage. No output or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input date data flows through get_date() into get_bangla_year() and get_bangla_weekday(). Calculations determine Bangla date components, which are then converted to Bengali digits and returned as a dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. Functions are straightforward, with no use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a calendar conversion utility from Gregorian to Bangla calendar, with standard date calculations, leap year handling, and digit conversions. It uses Python's datetime library for date handling and simple arithmetic for conversion logic. There are no indications of malicious code, data leakage, or backdoors. All operations are transparent and related solely to date computation and formatting.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign calendar conversion utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard date calculations and digit conversions without external data transmission or malicious behavior.",
