  "purpose": "Management and monitoring of Hugging Face inference endpoints, including status updates, deployment, scaling, and health checks.",
  "sources": "API responses, status polling, network reachability checks, raw data from API calls.",
  "sinks": "API calls for updates, status checks, health verification via GET requests to endpoint URLs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API responses into 'raw', then into object fields; network requests verify endpoint status; API methods mutate object state.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK for managing inference endpoints, performing API interactions, status polling, and health checks. No malicious code, sabotage, or supply chain risks are evident. Network interactions are typical for resource management. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses legitimate external modules. The network request in 'wait()' is a benign health check, not malicious. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign SDK component for managing inference endpoints. No signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation are present. The network interactions are standard and do not pose security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
