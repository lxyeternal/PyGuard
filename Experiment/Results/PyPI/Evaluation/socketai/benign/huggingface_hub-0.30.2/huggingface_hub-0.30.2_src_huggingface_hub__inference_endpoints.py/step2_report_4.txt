  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Correctly describes the code as managing inference endpoints, with data flowing from API responses into the `raw` attribute, then into object fields.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network transmission of untrusted data or code execution; standard API calls and polling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The logic is straightforward and aligns with SDK best practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), malware score 0, security risk 0.2 (low). The low security risk accounts for network interactions and API calls, which are expected.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No issues detected. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1, describing standard API interactions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of malicious data exfiltration or code injection. API calls are typical.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The logic is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No red flags.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Same as previous, managing inference endpoints via API.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious network activity or data leaks. API tokens are handled properly.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation. The code's behavior is typical for SDKs.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (0.95), malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-reasoned. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Standard management of inference endpoints.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests are used for status checks and reachability, which are normal.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Perfect confidence (1.0), malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Clear and accurate. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to others, with network requests during `wait()` to verify endpoint reachability.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The only potential concern is the GET request to the endpoint URL, which could expose untrusted URLs if manipulated.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets. The network request is part of normal endpoint validation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) due to the network request to an endpoint URL, but this is a standard health check, not malicious. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with the analysis. No malicious behavior or code injection detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1-0.2), justified by the API interactions and network requests, which are standard and necessary for endpoint management.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\nGiven the detailed reasoning, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a typical SDK for managing inference endpoints, with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. No adjustments needed.",
