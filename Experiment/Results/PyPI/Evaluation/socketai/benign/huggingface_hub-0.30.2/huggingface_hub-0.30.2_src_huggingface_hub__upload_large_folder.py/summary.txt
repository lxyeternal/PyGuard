  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured large folder uploader for HuggingFace, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minor workaround in 'HackyCommitOperationAdd' is justified within the context. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1)."
