  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'huggingface_hub' package, defining dependencies, metadata, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "File read operation in get_version() to extract version string, and static assignment of dependencies and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or data sources; static strings and files are used for configuration.",
  "flows": "The version string read from a file flows into package setup; dependencies and metadata are assigned and passed to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no code executes external commands, network operations, or processes untrusted data. The code reads a file to obtain version info but does not execute or process untrusted data beyond that.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the version number from a specific file without executing or evaluating external code. Dependencies are predefined static strings. The setup() function is called with static metadata and dependencies. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious operations are present. The code strictly performs package setup tasks without any runtime external influence or potential for malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It reads a version string from a file and configures package installation parameters without any malicious intent or security risks.",
