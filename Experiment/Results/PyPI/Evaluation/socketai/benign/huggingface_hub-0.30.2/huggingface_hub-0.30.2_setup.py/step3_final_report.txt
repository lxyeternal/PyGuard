{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the 'huggingface_hub' Python package, including dependencies, metadata, and entry points, with no dynamic or external code execution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from a source file; static dependencies; reads README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing; no external commands or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads version string from a file; dependencies and metadata are statically defined; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration, performing static file reads and dependency declarations. It does not execute untrusted code, connect to networks, or contain obfuscated logic. The version is extracted from a source file without execution, and dependencies are from trusted repositories. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
