  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the setup code is standard, with no malicious code, no external data processing, and dependencies from known sources.\n- **Findings:** The code reads version info from a source file, defines dependencies, and sets up package metadata. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** This is consistent and accurate. The code is typical for a setup script, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static configuration, reading version info from a file, no external execution.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies; only reading a version string, no external commands or untrusted data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is standard and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard setup with no suspicious activity, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- **Findings:** Reads version info, no malicious logic, dependencies are well-known.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup, no malicious behavior, just reading files and configuring setup.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic execution, no external data processing beyond reading files, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, no suspicious activity, straightforward setup.\n- **Findings:** Reads version info, no external code execution, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** All set to 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with no malicious behavior.\n- **Potential assumptions:** The reports do not assume any malicious intent beyond static setup, which is correct.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured setup script for a Python package.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code.\n- Dependency lists are explicit and from known repositories.\n- Version info is read from a source file without execution.\n- Entry points and package data are typical and safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** All reports are accurate. The scores are reasonable and reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:** The code is safe, standard packaging code with no indicators of compromise or malicious intent.",
