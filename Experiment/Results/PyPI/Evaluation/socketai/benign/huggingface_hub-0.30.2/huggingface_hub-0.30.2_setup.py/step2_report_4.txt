  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe standard setup.py code for a Python package.\n- The code reads version info from a source file, defines dependencies, and configures package metadata.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or network activity occurs during setup.\n- No obfuscated, suspicious, or malicious code detected.\n- The dependencies are explicit, sourced from known repositories.\n- Entry points and package data are standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, straightforward setup.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup, reading version info from a file.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Typical setup script, no suspicious code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No issues.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Reads version, no malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious indicators.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup, no malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0. The code does not perform any malicious activity, such as executing untrusted code, network operations, or embedding payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is appropriate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 is justified, as the setup script is static, from a trusted source, and does not process untrusted data.\n\n### **My Final Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**This code is a standard, benign setup script with no security concerns.**",
