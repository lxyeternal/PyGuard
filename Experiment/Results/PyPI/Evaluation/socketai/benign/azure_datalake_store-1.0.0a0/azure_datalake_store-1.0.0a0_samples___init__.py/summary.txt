  "conclusion": "Most reports accurately assess the code's security posture, with benign scripts scored low and the suspicious code in Report 5 appropriately rated high for malware, obfuscation, and risk. Slightly increasing the malware score for Report 5 to 0.7 and the overall risk to 0.8 provides a conservative yet justified assessment of the malicious indicators present."
