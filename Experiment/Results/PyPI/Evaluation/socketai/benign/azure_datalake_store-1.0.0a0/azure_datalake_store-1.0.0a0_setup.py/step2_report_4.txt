  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity; standard setup script; regex version extraction is safe.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.1, confidence 1.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard setup code, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0, confidence 1.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same observations; no anomalies or malicious activity.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1, confidence 1.  \n- **Assessment:** Matches the code.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Standard setup script, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0, confidence 1.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; no issues.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0, confidence 1.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is a typical setup script.  \n- **Malware risk:** None detected; no malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behaviors.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None; code is straightforward.  \n- **Security risk:** Very low; only reading static files and invoking `setup()`. The only potential concern is the regex version extraction, but it is standard practice and safe here.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any suspicious activity, it should be **0** or very close to it.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a standard, safe package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The current scores are appropriate, and I agree with the assessments provided.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0 (or very close to zero)  \n\nThis analysis confirms the code's integrity and security.",
