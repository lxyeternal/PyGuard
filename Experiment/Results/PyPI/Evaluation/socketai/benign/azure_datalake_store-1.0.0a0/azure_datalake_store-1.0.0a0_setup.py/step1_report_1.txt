{
  "purpose": "This script configures the setup for a Python package named 'azure-datalake-store', including metadata, dependencies, and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst', 'HISTORY.rst', and '__init__.py' to extract long description and version information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the script primarily reads files and invokes 'setup' with static and derived data.",
  "flows": "Reads file contents (sources), extracts version via regex, then passes static and dynamic data to 'setup' (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are detected. The regex for version extraction is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup configuration for a Python package, including reading files for description and extracting version info from a known location. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. It correctly handles potential errors in version extraction with a RuntimeError, which is acceptable. Usage of 'find_packages' and dependencies is typical and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It primarily handles package metadata and dependencies securely.",
