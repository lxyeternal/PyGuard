  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the azure-datalake-store library, reading static files for description and extracting version info from __init__.py.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst', 'HISTORY.rst', and '__init__.py' for metadata and version extraction.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only static file reads and setup invocation.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and invokes setup() with gathered metadata; no external or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with safe practices: static file reads, regex-based version extraction, no network or user input handling. All reports concur that it is benign, with malware scores of 0 and very low security risks (~0.1), primarily due to the regex pattern which is standard and safe. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe package setup file with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned by all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
