  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The script is a straightforward setup configuration, reading static files and extracting version info via regex from a known source file. No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or suspicious code.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (very low, just a slight concern perhaps due to the regex), confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** This is a typical setup script with no malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard package setup with no suspicious code, no external command execution, no untrusted input.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Completely standard, no security issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard setup, reading static files, extracting version via regex, no dynamic code or external interactions.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (again, very low).\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—standard package setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** No security risks.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Identical to others—standard setup, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description; it reads files, extracts version info, and calls `setup()`. No suspicious or malicious code is present.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on zero, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly due to the regex for version extraction, which is a common pattern and not risky.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned (all zeros for malware and obfuscated, very low for security risk) are appropriate.\n- No changes needed; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to the regex, which is standard practice)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus among the reports.",
