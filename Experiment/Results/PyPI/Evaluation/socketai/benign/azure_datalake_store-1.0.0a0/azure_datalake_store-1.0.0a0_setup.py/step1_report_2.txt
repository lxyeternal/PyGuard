{
  "purpose": "The script sets up the package configuration for the 'azure-datalake-store' Python library, including reading version info, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst', 'HISTORY.rst', and '__init__.py' for version info.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input data; no network or system modification commands.",
  "flows": "Read files to obtain metadata and version, then pass data into 'setup()' for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to extract version info is standard; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no suspicious file handling or command execution.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads static files to gather package metadata and version info, then calls 'setuptools.setup()' to configure package installation. It does not perform any network activity, command execution, or handle user input. The version extraction uses regex on a static source file, which is typical for package setup scripts. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. Overall, the script appears to be a standard package setup script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
