  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a standard setup.py script for a Python package.\n- The code reads static files ('README.rst', 'HISTORY.rst', and '__init__.py') to extract package description and version.\n- The version is extracted via a regex from '__init__.py', which is a common pattern.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input handling is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The dependencies and package metadata are typical.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No untrusted data sinks; straightforward reading files and calling setup.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; regex for version extraction is standard.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.1) seems reasonable given the absence of risks. Malware score is zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No external or untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** None; regex usage is standard.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; this is a typical setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The securityRisk of 0 is justified. Malware score remains zero, matching the lack of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No untrusted data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; standard setup process.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 is appropriate; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No untrusted data or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; typical setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The risk score is justified as zero; no malware or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No data leaks or malicious flows.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1 or 0), as the script is a typical setup script with no security issues.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to the regex version extraction, which is standard practice.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are reasonable given the code's nature. No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a standard, safe setup script.  \n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.  \n- The scoring reflects this accurately.",
