  "purpose": "Unit tests for retry logic in Azure Data Lake storage interactions using mock HTTP responses.",
  "sources": "Imports for pytest, responses, requests exceptions, and internal test modules. The code reads configuration settings and defines mock URLs.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or output effects; primarily testing mock interactions and exception handling within the test framework.",
  "flows": "The test functions trigger mock HTTP responses with specific error codes or exceptions, which are handled to validate retry logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. The code solely performs testing with mock responses.",
  "analysis": "The script is a test suite that uses the responses library to mock HTTP responses for testing retry behavior in Azure Data Lake SDK. It defines various test functions to simulate different HTTP errors and exceptions, asserting correct retry logic and exception handling. All code components relate to testing and do not contain any obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behavior. No external data is leaked or malicious payloads included. The code structure is typical for testing purposes, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for validating retry logic via mocked HTTP responses. There are no indications of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It is a safe, non-malicious test code for SDK retry behavior.",
