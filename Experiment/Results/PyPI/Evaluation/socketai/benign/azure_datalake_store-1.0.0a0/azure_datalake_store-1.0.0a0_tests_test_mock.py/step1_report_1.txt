{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform unit tests on Azure Data Lake store interactions, specifically testing retry logic for various HTTP errors and exceptions.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest, responses, requests, and internal test modules. No external data inputs or user data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted data; the code only mocks HTTP responses and asserts behavior.",
  "flows": "Test functions simulate HTTP errors and trigger retries via mocked responses; no flow of untrusted data from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code strictly performs testing with mocked data. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses responses library to mock HTTP responses, testing various error conditions and retry logic. It imports testing frameworks and Azure SDK components. The logic is straightforward, with no hidden or malicious code. The purpose is testing retry policies, and it avoids real network or data leakage. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present. The code appears safe and intended solely for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for Azure Data Lake retry logic with no malicious intent. It uses mocks for HTTP responses and asserts expected behaviors. No malware, supply chain risks, or security issues identified.",
