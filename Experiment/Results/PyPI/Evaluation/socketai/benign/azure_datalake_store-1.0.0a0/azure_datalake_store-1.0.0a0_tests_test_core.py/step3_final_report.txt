  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for the azure.datalake.store SDK, validating file operations, ACL management, cache, expiry, and other functionalities in a controlled environment.",
  "sources": "Reads from test functions, parameters, file paths, environment variables, and SDK method calls.",
  "sinks": "Performs file reads/writes, ACL modifications, cache operations, info retrieval, and other SDK interactions; no external network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows within SDK calls and filesystem operations; no suspicious external data flow or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors detected; standard testing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, well-documented test suite designed to validate SDK features. It uses controlled inputs, performs standard file and ACL operations, and contains no malicious logic or suspicious patterns. No external network activity or secret leaks are present. The code's purpose is validation, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely for testing SDK functionality, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
