  "purpose": "This code defines data structures and utility functions for a Core API implementation, including document, object, array, link, and error representations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from parameters passed to class constructors, especially content dictionaries, fields, and URL-related strings.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present, but data properties expose internal data structures. No network, file, or system command execution found.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into class properties and internal data attributes. No external data flow or command execution is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are identified. Usage of external codecs is standard; no obfuscation detected. No dynamic code execution or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data models with type validation and immutability patterns. It uses standard Python features such as namedtuple, property decorators, and class inheritance. The import statements reference external modules, but no code execution or external data handling occurs. No signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The structure and logic align with typical API data modeling, with no anomalous behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured API data model implementation with input validation. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior is detected. The overall security risk is minimal.",
