{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and serialization methods for Core API documents, links, errors, and immutable collections.",
  "sources": "Input data from function arguments and object initializations, especially in constructors of Document, Object, Array, Link, and Error classes.",
  "sinks": "Serialization functions (_repr and _str) potentially encoding data, but only within controlled codecs. No external network or file output detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments into class attributes, then through serialization functions for representation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code uses standard data validation and immutable data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines data structures with validation checks, ensuring inputs conform to expected types. No unsafe code execution, network operations, or data leaks are present. The serialization functions rely on codecs, which are standard and controlled. No suspicious logic, such as hidden backdoors or malicious data handling, is observed. The use of import statements appears standard, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of API data structures and serialization, with thorough input validation. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
