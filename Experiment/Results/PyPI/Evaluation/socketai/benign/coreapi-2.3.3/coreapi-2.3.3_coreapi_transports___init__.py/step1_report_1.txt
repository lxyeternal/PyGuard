  "purpose": "Exports specific transport classes from coreapi module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from coreapi.transports.base and coreapi.transports.http",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; only class imports and exports",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from the coreapi library and defines the __all__ list for exports. There are no data manipulations, user inputs, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be a straightforward module for re-exporting classes without any embedded or hidden malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This module solely re-exports classes from the coreapi package, serving as a clean interface for other modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation in this code.",
