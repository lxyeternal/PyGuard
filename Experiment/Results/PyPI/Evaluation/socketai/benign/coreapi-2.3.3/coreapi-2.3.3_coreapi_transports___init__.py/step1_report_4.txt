{
  "purpose": "This code defines exports for transport classes in the coreapi library, likely to be used for API communication.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'coreapi.transports.base' and 'coreapi.transports.http'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no execution of untrusted data or external commands",
  "flows": "Imports provide transport classes for external use; no data flow analysis beyond import and export",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export statements, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from the coreapi library and explicitly exports them via __all__. There is no dynamic execution, no user input handling, and no network operations or file manipulation. The code is minimal and appears to serve as a module's interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module export statement with no malicious intent, no obfuscated code, and no security risks identified.",
