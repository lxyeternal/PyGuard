{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module exports for coreapi transport classes, likely used for network communication.",
  "sources": "Imports from coreapi.transports.base and coreapi.transports.http modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imports serve as sources, and exported symbols are for external use; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple import and export statements without complex logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific transport classes from a coreapi package and declares them as publicly available via __all__. There is no user input handling, no network activity, and no suspicious code constructs. It functions as a straightforward module interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module declaration for transport classes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
