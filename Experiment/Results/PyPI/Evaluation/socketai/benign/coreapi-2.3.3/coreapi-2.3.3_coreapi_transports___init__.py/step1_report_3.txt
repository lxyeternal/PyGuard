  "purpose": "Define exports for coreapi transport classes",
  "sources": "Import statements from coreapi.transports modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output functions present",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flow from source to sink",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from the coreapi library, specifically BaseTransport and HTTPTransport. It then declares these classes as part of the module's public API via __all__. There are no data processing, user input handling, or dynamic code execution features present. The code appears to be a straightforward module for exporting transport classes, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign module that only exports classes from an external library. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
