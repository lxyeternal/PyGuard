  "purpose": "Module re-exports coreapi transport classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from coreapi.transports submodules.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external effects.",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports two classes and defines __all__ for module exports. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or data processing occurs. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and behavior. No vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module for re-exporting classes from coreapi. All analyses and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
