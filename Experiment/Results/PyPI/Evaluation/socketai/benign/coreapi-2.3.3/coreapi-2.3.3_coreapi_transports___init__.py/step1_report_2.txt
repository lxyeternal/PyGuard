  "purpose": "Define exports for coreapi transport modules",
  "sources": "Imports from coreapi.transports.base and coreapi.transports.http",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks within this code snippet",
  "anomalies": "Simple import statements and module exports, no unusual code or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from a package named coreapi.transports and defines an __all__ list for module exports. There are no input operations, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and appears to be a standard module setup for exporting classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module export setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
