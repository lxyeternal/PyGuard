  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility module for request handling, validation, content negotiation, and URL matching. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are identified. The confidence is high (0.9), and malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes the absence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The functions perform standard operations with proper validation and exception handling. The low malware and security risk scores are justified.\n\n- **Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing URL handling, codecs, file utilities, and validation. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. Slight concern about platform-dependent classes (DownloadedFile), but deemed benign.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's purpose. The use of platform-dependent classes is standard for file handling and does not indicate malicious intent. The security risk score is slightly above zero (0.2), which is acceptable given the file operations, but no malicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for request processing, validation, and content negotiation. No signs of malicious code or backdoors. The confidence is high (0.9), and malware and obfuscated scores are zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions operate purely on input parameters, with proper exception handling. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are evident.\n\n- **Verdict:** The scores are justified and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for URL scheme validation, media type negotiation, and validation. No malicious code or backdoors. The code is standard and safe.\n\n- **Assessment:** The detailed analysis confirms no malicious intent. The confidence level is high, and scores are consistent.\n\n- **Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for domain matching, codec negotiation, validation, and file handling. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code is standard and safe.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly states that the code performs typical utility functions without malicious intent. The security risk score is slightly above zero but justified due to input validation concerns.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security Risks:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2) are justified due to input validation and file handling but do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 across all reports — no signs of malicious code.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports — code is clear and standard.\n\n**Risk Score:** Given the validation and standard library usage, a conservative estimate would be around **0.1 to 0.2**, primarily due to file handling and plugin loading, but nothing malicious.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to file and plugin operations, but still very low)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
