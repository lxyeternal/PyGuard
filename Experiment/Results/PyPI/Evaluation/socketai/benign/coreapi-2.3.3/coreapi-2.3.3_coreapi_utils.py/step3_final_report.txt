  "purpose": "Utility functions for request handling, URL matching, content negotiation, validation, and file management.",
  "sources": "URL parsing, entry points for codecs, environment variables, and file attributes.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising, return values, and data validation routines; no data exfiltration or malicious effect identified.",
  "flows": "Input data from request URLs or parameters flows through validation and negotiation functions, with exception handling for invalid data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of platform-dependent classes (_TemporaryFileWrapper) and dynamic plugin loading are standard practices; no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of utility functions for request processing, content negotiation, and validation, relying on standard libraries and patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The functions perform expected operations with proper exception handling. The use of entry points and platform-dependent classes is typical in extensible systems and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, well-structured utility library with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) are justified given the validation routines and platform considerations.",
