  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for transport mechanisms, specifying a method to transition between states or connections.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data directly.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists within the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The class imports a module 'itypes' and defines a method that raises NotImplementedError, which is standard for abstract methods. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module, defines a class inheriting from itypes.Object, and declares a method intended to be overridden in subclasses. The method raises NotImplementedError, indicating it is meant as an abstract method. There are no data handling, input reading, or suspicious behaviors present. The structure is typical for an abstract class setup in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward abstract class definition for transport mechanisms with no malicious behavior detected. It does not include any code that could be exploited or that performs harmful actions.",
