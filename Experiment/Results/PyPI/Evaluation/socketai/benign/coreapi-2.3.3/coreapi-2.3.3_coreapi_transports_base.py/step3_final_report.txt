{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for transport mechanisms, serving as a template for subclasses.",
  "sources": "Import of 'itypes' module, class attribute 'schemes', and the 'transition' method that raises NotImplementedError.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or network activity present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definition with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard abstract class intended for subclassing. It imports 'itypes', defines a class with a class attribute and an unimplemented method. No data handling, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The structure is typical for interface-like classes, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The import of 'itypes' is not inherently suspicious without further context. The method raising NotImplementedError indicates a placeholder for subclasses to implement specific behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a template for transport classes. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a minimal security risk score (0 or 0.1) to account for external dependency considerations.",
