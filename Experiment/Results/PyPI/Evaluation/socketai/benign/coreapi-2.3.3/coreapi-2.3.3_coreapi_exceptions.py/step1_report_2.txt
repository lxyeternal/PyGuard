  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for a core API handling errors and exceptions.",
  "sources": "No external input or data read; no user input, network calls, or data parsing.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; exception messages are simple and do not include external input.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow involving untrusted input or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions with standard inheritance from Python's Exception. The ErrorMessage class stores an error string and provides string representations. There are no external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The code appears straightforward, intended for structured error handling within an API framework.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard set of custom exception classes for an API. It contains no malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and intentional for error management purposes.",
