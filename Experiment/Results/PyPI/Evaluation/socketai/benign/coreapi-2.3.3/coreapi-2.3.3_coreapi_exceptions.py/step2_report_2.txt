  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes for an API, with no external input, data processing, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.\n- The only class with some logic is `ErrorMessage`, which stores an error string and provides string representations. This is standard practice and not suspicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1 and malware/security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is just defining exception classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Any errors or flaws in reasoning?**  \n  No. The reasoning is consistent and accurate. The reports correctly conclude the code is safe and standard.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. Malware scores are 0, and security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Any need for score adjustments?**  \n  No. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, the risk scores are appropriately low (0). No justification needed for higher scores.\n\n### Malware score:\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity, so malware score should remain at 0.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is solely for error handling, which appears accurate. No assumptions about hidden malicious intent are justified based on the provided code.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and correctly scored. It poses no security threat.",
