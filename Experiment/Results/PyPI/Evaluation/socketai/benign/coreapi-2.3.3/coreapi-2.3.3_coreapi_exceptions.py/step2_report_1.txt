  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - The `ErrorMessage` class stores an error string and provides `__repr__` and `__str__` methods.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No external input, data reading, or untrusted data handling is present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n2. **Security and Malware Assessment**:\n   - The code appears to be standard, clean, and straightforward exception class definitions.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n   - The `ErrorMessage` class is a simple container for error messages, used for structured error handling.\n   - No evidence of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The high confidence scores (all 1s) are justified given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural for exception handling.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code does not process or handle untrusted input.\n   - No need to increase risk scores since the code is benign.\n\n5. **Final Justification**:\n   - The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated components.\n   - The risk score should remain at 0, reflecting no security threat.\n   - Malware score remains at 0.\n   - Obfuscated score remains at 0.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should not be increased.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' findings.",
