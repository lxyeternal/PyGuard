  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in a core API module.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines exception classes and constructors, with no input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data handling or output points.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only sets up class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions, with no data input, external interactions, or sensitive operations. The ErrorMessage class captures an error message for exception handling but does not process or transmit data insecurely. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of structured exception management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for defining exceptions in a Python module, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is safe and unlikely to be used for malicious purposes.",
