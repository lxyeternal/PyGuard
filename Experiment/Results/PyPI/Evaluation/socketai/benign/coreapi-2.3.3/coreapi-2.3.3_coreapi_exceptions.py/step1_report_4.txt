  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in a core API library.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; no external data sources used.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs, no untrusted data handling, no sensitive data processing.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the code consists solely of class definitions and docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Exception and a message class with methods for string representation. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or other operations that could be exploited. The __init__, __repr__, and __str__ methods are standard and do not include dynamic code execution or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. Overall, this code appears to be purely structural for error handling within an API context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
