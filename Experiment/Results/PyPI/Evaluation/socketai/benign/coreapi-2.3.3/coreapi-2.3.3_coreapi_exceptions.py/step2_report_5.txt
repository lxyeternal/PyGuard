  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes with no external input, data processing, or network activity.\n   - The code does not read external data, perform dynamic code execution, or contain any suspicious patterns.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is purely structural, with no security issues.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The conclusions are aligned with the code's content.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty in their assessments.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher score would imply some level of concern or suspicion, which is unwarranted here.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The code contains no malware or malicious intent.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's content.\n   - The code's simplicity and clarity support their assessments.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n**My Final Estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThis code is safe, clean, and serves a typical purpose within an API framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
