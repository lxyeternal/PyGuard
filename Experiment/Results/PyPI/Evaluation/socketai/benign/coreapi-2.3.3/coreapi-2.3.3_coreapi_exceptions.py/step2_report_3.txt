  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \nThe provided code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class, including a specialized ErrorMessage class that stores an error string and provides custom __repr__ and __str__ methods. The code is purely structural, with no data processing, external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Observations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward class definitions with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code does not read external data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No errors or flaws are evident in the code or the reasoning. The reports correctly interpret the code as standard exception class definitions.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity. The obfuscated score is also 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**  \n- All conclude the code is safe, straightforward, with no malicious intent.  \n- The reasoning is consistent and thorough, noting the absence of external inputs, network activity, or suspicious patterns.  \n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating certainty, which is justified.\n\n**Potential issues:**  \n- The only minor point is that the `ErrorMessage` class stores an error string and provides string representations, but this is standard practice and not suspicious.  \n- No report suggests any reason to increase the malware or security risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations & Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not contain any malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code is purely structural and does not pose any security threat.\n\n- **Risk score (overall):**  \n  The overall risk score should reflect the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores. Since all are zero, the overall risk is 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and reasonable.**  \nThe code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, clear, and serves a legitimate purpose within an API framework. No further action or concern is necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate scoring. The logic is sound, and no adjustments are needed.",
