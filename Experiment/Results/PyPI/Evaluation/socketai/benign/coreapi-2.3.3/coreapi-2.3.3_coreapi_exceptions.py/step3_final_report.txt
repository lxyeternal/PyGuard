  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for API error handling, including a class for error messages.",
  "sources": "No external input, data reading, or untrusted data handling; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data; purely structural code.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or external data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with ErrorMessage storing an error string and providing string representations. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code is standard, benign, and serves as error handling infrastructure. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
