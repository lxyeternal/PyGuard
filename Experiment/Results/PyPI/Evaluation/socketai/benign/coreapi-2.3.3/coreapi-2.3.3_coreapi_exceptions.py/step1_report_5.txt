  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a core API handling library.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and methods, no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists of standard exception class definitions with no suspicious patterns or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception. The 'ErrorMessage' class stores an error string and provides string representations. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns. The code appears to be standard exception handling setup for a library. No obfuscation, malicious behaviors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or suspicious activities.",
