  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No external data, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is straightforward, serving as error handling infrastructure.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code snippets are exactly as described: class definitions inheriting from `Exception`, with one class (`ErrorMessage`) that stores an error message and provides string representations.\n- No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.\n- The reports' assessments of safety and benign intent are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Potential issues or flaws:**\n- The only point to consider is whether the `ErrorMessage` class could be misused in some context, but as it only stores and formats an error string, it does not pose any security threat.\n- The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable class definitions.\n- **Risk score:** 0. Given the lack of any vulnerabilities, malicious code, or security issues, this is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate; the code is safe, non-malicious, and purely structural.\n- No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.",
