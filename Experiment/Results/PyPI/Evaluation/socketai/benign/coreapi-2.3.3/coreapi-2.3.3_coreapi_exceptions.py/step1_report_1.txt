{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a core API handling different error scenarios.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; class definitions do not read data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; class initializations are straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard exception class definitions without unusual patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception. It includes a specialized error class with an __init__ method that stores an error message and custom __repr__ and __str__ methods. No external data is read, no untrusted input handling, no network activity, and no suspicious logic. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code appears to be standard, clean exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for an API module. It contains no malicious behavior, no malware, and no security risks. It is safe and does not pose any threat.",
