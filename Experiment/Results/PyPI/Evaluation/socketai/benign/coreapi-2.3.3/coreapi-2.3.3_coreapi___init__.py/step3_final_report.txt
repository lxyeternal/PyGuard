{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module setup for the 'coreapi' client library, importing components, defining version, and setting export symbols.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'coreapi' package, version string, and __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, network activity, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; purely static import and metadata definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports various components from 'coreapi', sets a version string, and defines the __all__ list for public API exposure. It contains no dynamic code, data processing, network operations, or logic beyond imports and metadata. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the benign and static nature of the code. The confidence level is high (1) due to the straightforward analysis. There are no signs of security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
