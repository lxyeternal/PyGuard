{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules and components from the 'coreapi' package and defines the package version and exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'coreapi' library: auth, codecs, exceptions, transports, utils, Client, Array, Document, Link, Object, Error, Field",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations such as network connections, file access, or environment variable reads.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports modules and sets exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code constructs, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific components from the 'coreapi' package, sets a version string, and defines its exported symbols. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data handling that could pose security risks. The imports are from a well-known package, and no suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization with no malicious intent or security issues. It merely re-exports selected components from 'coreapi'.",
