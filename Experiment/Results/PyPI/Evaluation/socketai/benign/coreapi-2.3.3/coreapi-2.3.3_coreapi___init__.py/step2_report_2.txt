  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward import statements from the 'coreapi' package, defining version info and export symbols.\n- No dynamic code execution, data handling, network activity, or sensitive operations are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to serve as a module setup or API surface declaration.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, hardcoded secrets, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned for malware (0) and security risk (0) are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The confidence level is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only minor note is the hardcoded version string, but that is standard practice and not suspicious.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n\n**Summary of the review:**\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is a simple module import and export setup.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None. The reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n- **Score adjustments:** The assigned scores (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and should remain unchanged.\n- **Risk justification:** Since the code is purely import statements with no malicious or risky behavior, the risk score of 0 is justified.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0; no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** None are made; the analysis correctly identifies the code as benign.\n- **Score consistency:** The scores align well with the code's content.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a benign module setup with no security issues.\n- I agree with the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action or concern is necessary.",
