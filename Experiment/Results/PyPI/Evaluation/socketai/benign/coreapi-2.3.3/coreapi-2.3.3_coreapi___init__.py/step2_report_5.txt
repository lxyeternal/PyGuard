  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from the 'coreapi' package, defining version and __all__ variables.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, network operations, or input handling are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- The code appears to serve as a module setup or API surface definition.\n\n**Security implications:**\n- Given the code's static nature and reliance on a well-known external library ('coreapi'), there are no signs of malicious activity.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The risk scores are all 0, which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only minor point is the hardcoded version string, but this is standard practice and not suspicious.\n- No evidence of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate; the code is benign.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\nThis code snippet is a typical module setup for an open-source API client library, with no security concerns.",
