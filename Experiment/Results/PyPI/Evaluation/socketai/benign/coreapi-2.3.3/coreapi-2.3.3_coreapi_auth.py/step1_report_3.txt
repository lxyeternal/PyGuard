{
  "purpose": "Implementations of various authentication mechanisms for HTTP requests, including Basic, Token, and Session-based authentication.",
  "sources": "Input data includes 'request' objects, tokens, domain parameters, and response objects; data is read from parameters and response cookies.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data is written to request headers ('Authorization', CSRF headers) and stored in object state (csrf_token).",
  "flows": "Tokens or credentials are used in request headers, and CSRF tokens are extracted from responses and stored for subsequent requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; the code handles CSRF tokens and headers in a typical manner. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard HTTP authentication classes: Basic, Token, and Session-based. 'domain_matches' function is used to restrict authentication to specific domains, which is typical. No malicious behavior detected; no data leaks or system compromise mechanisms are present. The code appears to follow secure patterns for handling tokens and session data. No hardcoded secrets, no network exfiltration, and no suspicious behavior noted.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard and secure authentication classes without evident malicious intent or security issues. It adheres to typical patterns for handling tokens, credentials, and CSRF protection. No malware or suspicious anomalies detected.",
