  "purpose": "Implementations of various authentication mechanisms for HTTP requests, including Basic, Token, and Session-based authentication.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include request objects, user credentials (username, password, token), and domain parameters.",
  "sinks": "Modifications to request headers, particularly 'Authorization' and CSRF tokens, which could influence request authentication and security.",
  "flows": "Credentials and domain parameters flow into authentication classes; these classes modify request headers and manage CSRF tokens before sending requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code patterns. Use of domain matching to conditionally modify requests appears standard. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three classes for different authentication strategies. Each class uses standard libraries and practices for managing credentials and CSRF tokens. The use of 'domain_matches' ensures conditional request modification based on domain, which is typical in multi-domain setups. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code does not contain any obfuscated logic or malicious payloads. It appears to be legitimate authentication code for HTTP requests.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of multiple authentication methods with proper handling of CSRF tokens and domain restrictions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code adheres to standard practices without suspicious anomalies.",
