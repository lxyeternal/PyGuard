  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities for Python 2 and 3, including URL parsing, string handling, base64 encoding, and optional styling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for encoding functions, imported modules (base64, urlparse, cookiejar, click, tempfile).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; functions operate on provided inputs without external data flows.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into encoding and string conversion functions; no external data or network interactions involved.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward utility functions with standard practices, no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility module handling compatibility between Python versions, string encoding, base64 encoding, and optional styling. It does not process untrusted input, perform network or file operations, or contain obfuscation or malicious code. The functions are simple, well-structured, and use common practices. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely utility, with no data leaks or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, utility-focused, and poses no security threat. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code's straightforward structure and lack of external data handling confirm its safety.",
