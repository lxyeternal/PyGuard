{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and compatibility handling for Python 2 and 3, including base64 encoding, string encoding/decoding, and conditional imports for URL parsing, cookies, and console styling.",
  "sources": "Import statements and conditional code sections that determine runtime environment (Python version), as well as functions like b64encode, force_bytes, and force_text that process input data.",
  "sinks": "Functions like b64encode that encode data; no untrusted data flows explicitly shown to reach sensitive sinks such as network, file, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data (strings) flow through encoding functions like b64encode, force_bytes, and force_text, but these are standard utility functions with no evident malicious intent or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior. Conditional imports and environment-specific handling are standard practice. The _TemporaryFileWrapper import check is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module for compatibility across Python 2 and 3, with functions for encoding and decoding strings, handling base64, and optional styling with the 'click' library. No hardcoded credentials, malicious functions, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code avoids unsafe practices and does not include any network or system manipulations. All operations are standard utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module intended for compatibility and basic data encoding. No malicious activity, malware, or security risks are detected based on this content.",
