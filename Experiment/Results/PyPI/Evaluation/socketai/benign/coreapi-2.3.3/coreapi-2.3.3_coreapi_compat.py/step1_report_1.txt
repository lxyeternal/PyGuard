{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and compatibility imports for Python 2 and 3, including base64 encoding, string handling, and optional styling with click.",
  "sources": "The code reads modules for URL parsing, cookie handling, base64 encoding, string conversion, and optional click styling.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or system command execution is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; functions are primarily utility wrappers with no external data dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. Compatibility handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script establishes compatibility between Python 2 and 3 for URL parsing, string types, base64 encoding, and optional click styling. It defines functions to encode/decode strings safely across versions. No malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious data flows are present. The code is straightforward utility code meant for supporting other modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily utility functions for compatibility and encoding with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
