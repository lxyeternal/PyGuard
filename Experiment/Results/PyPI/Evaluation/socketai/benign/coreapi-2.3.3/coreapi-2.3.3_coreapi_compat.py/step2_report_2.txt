  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer concludes the code is benign, utility functions for compatibility, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Justification:** The reasoning aligns with the code, which is standard compatibility code with no data leaks or malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard utility functions, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is described as a compatibility utility with no malicious features.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Justification:** The code is simple, standard, and safe.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, noting no malicious or suspicious features.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Justification:** The code is utility-focused, with no external data flows or vulnerabilities.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that the code is utility and compatibility functions, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no suspicious features.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's utility purpose and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Note:** The code is standard compatibility utility code with no malicious or suspicious features. The scores assigned in all reports are justified and consistent with the code's content.",
