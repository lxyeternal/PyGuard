  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. It correctly identifies that the code is utility-focused, handling compatibility, encoding, and styling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This aligns with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** No issues are present; the code is straightforward and safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the benign nature, standard utility functions, and compatibility handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or suspicious features detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** The code remains standard utility code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is described as benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** No issues detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; the code is utility and compatibility-focused, with no malicious features.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious. The code is standard utility functions with no network, file, or system command execution, no obfuscation, and no suspicious logic.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any report; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate for all.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a compatibility utility module, which is common in open-source projects.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.\n- No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, standard, and poses no security threat.\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate; the code is benign, with appropriate scoring.",
