      "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is effectively 0 (or 0.1 for conservative estimation). No modifications are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented Windows audio session management utility. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is justified, primarily due to callback mechanisms that could be misused if user callbacks are malicious. Overall, the code poses minimal security concerns and functions as intended for audio session control."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of Windows audio session and device notification interfaces. It contains no embedded malicious or obfuscated code. The potential security risk depends solely on user overrides of callback methods, which is expected for such interface classes. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for supply chain use with standard precautions."

The analysis supports a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1-0.2), primarily considering potential misuse if inputs are untrusted. Overall, it is safe and well-structured."

      "conclusion": "Given the absence of code snippets, the reports' conclusions of benignity are justified. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero. Slightly lowering the security risk scores from 0.2 to 0.1 for reports 1-3 would better reflect the minimal risk in the absence of evidence. Overall, the evaluations are appropriate and consistent with the available information."
