  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of static GUID and enum definitions related to Windows audio device management.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, network communication, or file operations are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs, obfuscation, secrets, or backdoors are identified.\n- The purpose appears to be to facilitate COM interface interactions with Windows audio components.\n- Confidence in the assessments is consistently high (1), and all reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is purely static, with no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The use of GUIDs and enums aligns with standard Windows API usage.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or vulnerabilities are detected.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, since there's no evident security concern.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- None identified. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final Expert Evaluation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign set of definitions for Windows audio COM interfaces, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is standard, static, and safe. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code poses no security threat and is typical for system-level API interactions.",
