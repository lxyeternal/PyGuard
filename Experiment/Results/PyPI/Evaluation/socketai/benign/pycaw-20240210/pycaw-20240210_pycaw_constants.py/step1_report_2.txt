  "purpose": "Define various GUIDs and enumerations related to audio device management and session states in Windows using comtypes and standard enum types.",
  "sources": "Import statements, enum and GUID definitions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow or processing from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of importing modules, defining GUID constants, and declaring enum classes for audio device states, roles, data flow directions, and session states. These are standard definitions used for Windows audio device management. There are no dynamic code executions, user input handling, network communications, or other suspicious behaviors. No obfuscation, no unusual constructs, and no embedded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward set of enum and GUID definitions for audio device management. There is no malicious intent or security risk evident from this code segment.",
