{
  "purpose": "Define constants and enumerations related to COM interfaces and audio device states for use in audio management and COM interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'comtypes' and 'enum'; assignments of GUIDs.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not process untrusted input or perform operations that could lead to data leakage or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code primarily establishes constants and enum classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of enum definitions and GUID assignments used for COM interface interactions, specifically related to audio device management. All imported modules are standard or well-known, and no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling that could be malicious are present. The constants and enums appear to be standard and documented for Windows audio COM interfaces.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module defining constants and enums for COM audio device interfaces. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity detected.",
