  "purpose": "Static definitions of GUIDs and enums for Windows audio COM interfaces, used for system API interactions.",
  "sources": "Constant GUID and enum declarations; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static definitions without execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static GUID and enum definitions related to Windows audio APIs. It contains no functions, dynamic code, input/output operations, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is standard for COM interface definitions and poses no security risk. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero with high confidence. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of GUIDs and enums for Windows audio device management, with no malicious or security concerns. The existing reports are accurate and appropriately scored.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
