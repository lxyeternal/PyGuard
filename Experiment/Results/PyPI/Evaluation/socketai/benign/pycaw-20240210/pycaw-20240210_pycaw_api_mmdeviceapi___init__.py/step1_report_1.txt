  "purpose": "Defines COM interface classes for interacting with Windows audio devices, including device enumeration, notification, and property access.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'ctypes', 'comtypes', and local modules; class attribute definitions; COM method declarations",
  "sinks": "None identified. No data transmission, file operations, network access, or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows identified. The code declares interface methods without implementation, serving as a bridge to Windows APIs",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of interface class definitions for Windows COM components related to audio device management. It includes method signatures with parameters and return types. There are no implementations, no data handling, nor network operations. It appears to be a straightforward, clean declaration of COM interfaces. No suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or anomalies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard COM interface declaration for Windows audio device management. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code's purpose is to facilitate Windows audio device interactions through well-defined interfaces. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
