{
  "purpose": "Defines COM interface classes for interacting with audio devices and notifications on Windows using ctypes and comtypes libraries.",
  "sources": "Imports from ctypes and comtypes, and local depend module. No user input or external data reading is evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output points, no data leaks or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code purely defines interfaces and method signatures for COM objects.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only interface definitions; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides COM interface definitions for Windows audio device management, including device enumeration, notification, and control. It uses standard Python ctypes and comtypes modules. There are no signs of malicious logic, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoor functionalities. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs are present. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a larger Windows audio management tool or library.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of COM interface definitions for Windows audio device management. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the content. It is safe and typical for such system-level interface definitions.",
