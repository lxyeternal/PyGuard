{
  "purpose": "This code defines COM interface classes for Windows audio device management, serving as an interface layer without executable logic.",
  "sources": "COM method parameters such as device IDs, property keys, and data flow methods",
  "sinks": "No data leaks or external data outputs; purely interface declarations",
  "flows": "Data flows from system APIs into interface method calls; no active data transmission or network activity",
  "anomalies": "None; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of COM interface class definitions using ctypes and comtypes, with method signatures matching Windows audio device management APIs. There is no implementation, data processing, or network activity. The interfaces are standard and do not contain malicious logic or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are appropriate. The code's benign nature and lack of active behavior indicate minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe declaration of Windows COM interfaces for audio device management, posing no security threat or malicious behavior.",
