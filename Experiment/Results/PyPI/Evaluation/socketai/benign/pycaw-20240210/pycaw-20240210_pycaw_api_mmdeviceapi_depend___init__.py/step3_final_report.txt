{
  "purpose": "Defines a COM interface IPropertyStore for Windows property management, allowing get/set operations on properties.",
  "sources": "Methods GetCount, GetAt, GetValue, SetValue, and Commit, which access property data via COM calls.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could flow into GetValue and SetValue if invoked externally, but the code itself only declares interface signatures.",
  "flows": "External callers invoke methods with property keys and variants; no internal data flow or processing occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution; standard interface declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard Windows COM interface for property storage, with no executable logic or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscation score 0, and low risk (~0.1) due to potential misuse if invoked improperly. The high confidence scores reflect the clarity and standard nature of the code. The main security concern depends on external usage, not the interface definition itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard COM interface declaration with no malicious intent or suspicious features. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
