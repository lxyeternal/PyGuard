  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented Windows audio session management utility. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is justified, primarily due to callback mechanisms that could be misused if user callbacks are malicious. Overall, the code poses minimal security concerns and functions as intended for audio session control."
