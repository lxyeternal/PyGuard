{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for managing Windows audio devices and sessions via COM interfaces, including device enumeration, property access, and session control.",
  "sources": "COM interface calls retrieving device properties, session info, process IDs, and device states; psutil for process information.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures, session properties, device info; no external communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system APIs into internal objects and properties; no external sinks or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with Windows COM APIs for device and session management in a straightforward manner, using standard interfaces. It reads device properties, session identifiers, process IDs, and manages volume controls. No external data transmission, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The use of psutil for process info and warnings.warn for COM errors are standard practices. The code's purpose appears to be legitimate system utility functionality, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows audio management utility with no malicious intent or behavior. The analysis supports a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1-0.2), primarily considering potential misuse if inputs are untrusted. Overall, it is safe and well-structured.",
