  "purpose": "The code is a routine utility performing data processing, logging, or similar benign operations without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, function parameters, input data streams.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, file writes, network calls (if any), but none are suspicious or untrusted in context.",
  "flows": "Input sources to processing functions, then to outputs or external systems, with no evidence of malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate straightforward, well-structured code with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Malware scores are consistently zero, and obfuscation scores are zero, aligning with benign descriptions. Risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal residual concern, which is reasonable given the lack of concrete suspicious indicators. Confidence levels are high, based on the provided summaries. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation, and the low risk score appropriately captures the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe, with no malicious or obfuscated features detected. The low risk score of 0.2 is justified but could be conservatively lowered to 0 if desired. Overall, the assessments are consistent, justified, and reflect a benign codebase.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
