  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility for data processing and logging, with no explicit malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external files or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Data is output via logging, print statements, or writing to files. Network calls or system commands are not clearly indicated.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or inputs flows through functions, with logging or output functions as sinks. No clear untrusted data flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution evident. Structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is clean and well-structured, primarily performing data processing tasks. No indicators of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. No suspicious behavior, code injection, or unsafe practices are observed. The absence of external calls or encryption routines suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe, with no anomalies or malware indicators.",
