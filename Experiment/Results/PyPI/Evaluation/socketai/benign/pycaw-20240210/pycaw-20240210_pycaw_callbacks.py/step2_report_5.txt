  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code provides COM interface wrappers for Windows audio session notifications, reading data from callback parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from COM callbacks into user-overridable methods; no internal logic or dangerous operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; relies on standard COM handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears to be a standard, legitimate wrapper for Windows audio session notifications. It is designed to be extended by users; no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, due to potential misuse if user code is malicious).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues found. The code is a typical COM interface wrapper, safe by itself.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, handling audio session and device notifications via COM.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from COM callbacks into user-implemented methods, which are placeholders.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate COM wrappers, intended for event handling, with no internal malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Again, standard, safe interface code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines classes for Windows audio session and device notifications.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data from COM callbacks into user-overridable methods; no internal actions.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, non-malicious COM interface wrappers, intended for user extension.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Safe, standard code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** COM callback handler classes for Windows audio events.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into callback methods, which are placeholders.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical interface classes, safe and intended for user implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar COM interface wrappers for Windows audio notifications.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into user-overridable methods; no internal logic.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, safe, and benign code for Windows audio event handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity or risks.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate 0, and the code itself contains no malicious logic—it's a set of COM interface wrappers meant for event handling.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (mostly 0.1–0.2), reflecting that misuse depends on user-implemented callback methods, not the core code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of COM interface wrappers for Windows audio notifications.\n- It does not contain any embedded malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The data flows are limited to callback parameters, which are intended to be processed by user-defined methods.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, network activity, or system modifications.\n- The risk is minimal and primarily depends on how the user overrides the callback methods.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, as the core code is safe; potential risk exists only if user code implements malicious logic.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a safe, standard set of COM interface wrappers for Windows audio notifications, with no inherent malicious or obfuscated components.",
