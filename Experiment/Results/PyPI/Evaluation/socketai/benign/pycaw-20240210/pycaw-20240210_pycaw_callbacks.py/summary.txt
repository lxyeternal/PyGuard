  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of Windows audio session and device notification interfaces. It contains no embedded malicious or obfuscated code. The potential security risk depends solely on user overrides of callback methods, which is expected for such interface classes. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for supply chain use with standard precautions."
