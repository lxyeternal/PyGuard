{
  "purpose": "Defines callback handler classes for audio session, device, and volume events using COM interfaces in Windows, intended for use with the pycaw library.",
  "sources": "Imports from comtypes, pycaw.api, and pycaw.utils; class methods and callback functions that process Windows audio session and device events.",
  "sinks": "Callback methods that are invoked by Windows COM events, e.g., OnNotify, OnSessionCreated, OnDefaultDeviceChanged, which process audio event data.",
  "flows": "COM event triggers invoke callback methods; data from Windows (e.g., volume levels, device states) flows into user-defined callback methods. No external untrusted data sources or network interactions are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. The code is primarily boilerplate for Windows COM event handling with placeholder methods for user implementation. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly provides class templates for handling Windows audio-related COM callbacks via the pycaw library. All methods intended for user override are placeholders, with no internal logic or data exfiltration. No suspicious patterns, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard interface definitions for audio session and device event callbacks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of callback handler classes for Windows audio events, meant for use with pycaw. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this fragment. It is safe and primarily serves as an interface template.",
