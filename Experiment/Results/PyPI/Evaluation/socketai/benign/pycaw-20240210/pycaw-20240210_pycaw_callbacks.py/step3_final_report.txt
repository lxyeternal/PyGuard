{
  "purpose": "The code provides COM interface wrappers for Windows audio session, device, and volume notifications, intended for user extension to handle audio events.",
  "sources": "COM callback parameters such as new_session, new_display_name, new_icon_path, new_volume, event_context, device_id, property_struct, etc.",
  "sinks": "User-implemented methods that process callback data; no internal data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from COM callback inputs into user-overridable methods, which are placeholders or pass-through functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; standard pattern for COM event handling.",
  "analysis": "The classes are straightforward COM interface wrappers designed for extension. They do not perform any internal logic or network activity. The callback methods are meant to be overridden by users, which could introduce malicious behavior if overridden maliciously, but the core code is benign. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low risk) are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of Windows audio session and device notification interfaces. It contains no embedded malicious or obfuscated code. The potential security risk depends solely on user overrides of callback methods, which is expected for such interface classes. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for supply chain use with standard precautions.",
