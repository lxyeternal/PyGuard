  "conclusion": "Given the absence of code snippets, the reports' conclusions of benignity are justified. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero. Slightly lowering the security risk scores from 0.2 to 0.1 for reports 1-3 would better reflect the minimal risk in the absence of evidence. Overall, the evaluations are appropriate and consistent with the available information."
