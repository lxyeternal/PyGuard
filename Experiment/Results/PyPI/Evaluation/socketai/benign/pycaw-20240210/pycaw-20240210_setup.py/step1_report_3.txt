  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input are present.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content during setup, no untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and third-party dependencies for package setup. It reads a file for the long description, which is typical in setup scripts. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is present. The dependencies 'comtypes' and 'psutil' are common system libraries. The code strictly performs package configuration without executing any runtime logic or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies.",
