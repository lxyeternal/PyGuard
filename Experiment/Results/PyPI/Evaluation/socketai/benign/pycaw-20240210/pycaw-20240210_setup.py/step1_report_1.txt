  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'pycaw' Python package, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is used directly; the setup process involves standard package installation routines.",
  "flows": "The content of 'README.md' flows from reading the file into the 'long_description' parameter during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for setup, defines a function to read files, specifies dependencies, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata and requirements. It reads the README.md for documentation, which is standard practice. No code injection, malicious behavior, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
