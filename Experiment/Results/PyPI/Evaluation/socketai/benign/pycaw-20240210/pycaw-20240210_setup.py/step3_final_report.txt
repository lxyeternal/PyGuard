  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging, reading README.md for description, specifying dependencies 'comtypes' and 'psutil'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the script does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reads local file and passes metadata to setup(); no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script using setuptools. It reads a local README.md file, specifies dependencies, and calls setup() with package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or obfuscated segments. All dependencies are standard, and the script performs typical package configuration tasks. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is effectively 0 (or 0.1 for conservative estimation). No modifications are necessary.",
