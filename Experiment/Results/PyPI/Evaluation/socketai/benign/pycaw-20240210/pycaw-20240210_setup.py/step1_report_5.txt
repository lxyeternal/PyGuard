  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pycaw' Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; importing modules; reading dependency list.",
  "sinks": "None identified where untrusted data flows into critical operations; no user input handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> setup configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns; standard setup script structure.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and uses setuptools for package setup. The 'read' function reads a local 'README.md' file for long description. Dependencies are specified as 'comtypes' and 'psutil'. The setup configuration includes package info, author, URL, and package discovery. No user input, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are identified. The code appears to be a legitimate package setup script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
