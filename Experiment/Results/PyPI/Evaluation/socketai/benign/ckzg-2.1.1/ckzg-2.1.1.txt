The primary concern is external script trustworthiness, not the code itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2) due to reliance on external build scripts."

      "conclusion": "The script is a standard build utility for generating Node.js bindings, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is low, primarily related to reliance on external inputs, which is typical for such scripts. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a conservative risk score of 0.2 is appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The script is a standard build automation tool for cryptographic WebAssembly bindings, with some obfuscation and environment-dependent behaviors. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The primary concern is the cloning from an unverified local source, which could be risky if the source is compromised, but in a trusted environment, this is acceptable. The obfuscation techniques are typical for build scripts and do not indicate malicious intent."
