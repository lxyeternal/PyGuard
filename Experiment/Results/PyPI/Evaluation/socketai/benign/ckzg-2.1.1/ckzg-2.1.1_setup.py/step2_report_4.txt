  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard build script, no malicious behavior, external build scripts are trusted but could be risks if compromised.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The external commands are typical in build processes; the try-except pass is benign. No malicious code detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores seem appropriate. The low risk score (0.2) accounts for reliance on external scripts, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes external build commands, no malicious behavior, external scripts could be risks if compromised.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No suspicious logic or data leaks. The handling of exceptions is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard setup with platform-specific build commands, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The absence of external script details and the high confidence (1) is justified. No suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard build process, no malicious activity, platform-specific commands.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, standard build script, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The script executes external build commands but does not contain or execute malicious code internally.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.0 to 0.2). Given the reliance on external scripts, a small risk score (0.2) is justified, but not higher.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — external build scripts could be compromised, but this is common and not specific to this code. The script itself is benign.\n\n**Note:** The only potential concern is the external build scripts ('blst\\\\build.bat' and 'make'), which are outside the scope of this code. Their integrity depends on the environment and supply chain security.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard setup script for building a Python extension with C components, with platform-specific build steps. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The low risk score reflects the reliance on external scripts, which is acceptable in open-source build processes.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese are aligned with the analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
