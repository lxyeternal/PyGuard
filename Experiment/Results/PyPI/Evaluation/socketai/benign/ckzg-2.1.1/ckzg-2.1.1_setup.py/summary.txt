  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard build setup script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary concern is external script trustworthiness, not the code itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2) due to reliance on external build scripts."
