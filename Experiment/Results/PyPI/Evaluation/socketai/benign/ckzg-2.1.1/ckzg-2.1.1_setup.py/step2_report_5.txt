  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard build script for a Python package with C extensions, involving custom build steps for Windows and Linux.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Reads files, executes external commands ('blst\\\\build.bat' and 'make'), which are typical in build processes.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of try-except with pass is benign; no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; external commands are standard. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate build script; external commands are potential risk points but common in open-source projects.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The security risk is minimal but acknowledges external command reliance.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing external build commands ('blst\\\\build.bat' and 'make') and standard setup procedures.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- Use of try-except is benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with Report 1; external commands are potential risk points but typical.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Same pattern: platform-specific build commands, reading README.md, setting up extension modules.\n- No suspicious behavior or malicious code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar analysis: standard setup with platform-specific build commands.\n- No untrusted data handling or network activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same pattern: standard build script, no suspicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or suspicious behavior:** No. All reports confirm the code is a typical setup script.\n- **External commands ('blst\\\\build.bat' and 'make'):** Standard in building C extensions, but potential risk if these scripts are compromised. However, the code itself does not contain malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, mostly due to reliance on external build scripts, which is typical.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at **0**.\n- The security risk score can be slightly increased from 0 to **0.2** in some reports, reflecting the reliance on external build scripts, but overall, the risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (due to external build scripts, but standard practice)\n\nThis aligns with the consensus of the reports and the typical risk profile of such build scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, legitimate build script for a Python extension module, with no signs of malicious activity. External build steps are common but should be verified for integrity separately. The scores should reflect the low malware and obfuscation risk, with a slight increase in security risk due to reliance on external scripts.",
