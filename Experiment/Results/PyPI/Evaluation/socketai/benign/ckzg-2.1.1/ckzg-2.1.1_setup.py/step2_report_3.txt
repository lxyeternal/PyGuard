  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script's purpose and sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurately notes external build commands (`check_call`), which could be risky if compromised.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Mentions the try-except block, standard build steps, no malicious code, and the benign nature of the script.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Reasonable, with high confidence (0.9). No obfuscation or malware.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code matches the report's description. External commands are standard but could be a risk if the build environment is compromised.  \n- The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity detected.  \n- Security risk is low (0.2), consistent with the report.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the external build commands and their potential risks.  \n- Also notes the try-except block and the absence of suspicious code.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning aligns with the code.  \n- Malware score 0 is appropriate.  \n- Security risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Reiterates the script's purpose and the platform-specific build commands.  \n- Notes no suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- Confident and straightforward.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code matches the description.  \n- Malware score 0 is justified.  \n- Security risk minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Highlights the core build process, platform-specific commands, and the reading of README.md.  \n- Finds no suspicious behavior or data leaks.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Consistent with the code.  \n- Malware score 0 justified.  \n- Low security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Summarizes the script as a standard build setup with no suspicious behavior.  \n- Emphasizes the absence of user input handling, network activity, or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Accurate reflection of the code.  \n- Malware score 0 appropriate.  \n- Security risk low.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code executes external build scripts, which are standard in such contexts, but there's no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration. Therefore, **malware score should remain at 0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward. **Obfuscated score remains at 0**.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the reliance on external build scripts, the main concern is supply chain integrity. However, the code itself is standard and does not perform any risky operations. The risk score of 0.2 across reports seems reasonable, reflecting minor concern over external scripts but no direct threat.\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.2**\n\nThese scores are consistent with the analysis and the provided reports.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The main security consideration is ensuring the integrity of external build scripts (`build.bat` and `make`). As the code itself is benign, the focus should be on verifying the trustworthiness of those scripts in the build environment.",
