  "purpose": "Setup script for building a Python extension module with platform-specific build commands, invoking external build scripts for dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file, executes external build commands ('blst\\build.bat' on Windows, 'make -C src blst' on other platforms).",
  "sinks": "External commands executed via check_call; no data sinks within the code itself.",
  "flows": "Reads files for long description, runs external build scripts, then proceeds with setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except with pass around Windows build script; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package with C extensions. It executes external build scripts which are typical but could be a supply chain risk if compromised. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The exception handling is benign. External scripts should be verified separately for integrity. Overall, the code is straightforward and aligns with common practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard build setup script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary concern is external script trustworthiness, not the code itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2) due to reliance on external build scripts.",
