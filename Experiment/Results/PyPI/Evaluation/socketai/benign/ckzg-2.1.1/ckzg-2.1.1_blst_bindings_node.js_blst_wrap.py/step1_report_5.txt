{
  "purpose": "This script automates the process of copying and generating C++ source files for JavaScript bindings, depending on environment variables and Node.js version.",
  "sources": "sys.argv inputs, environment variable 'BLST_WRAP_CPP_PREBUILD', subprocess outputs from 'swig -version' and 'node --version'.",
  "sinks": "File copying operations (shutil.copyfile), subprocess calls, writing to stderr.",
  "flows": "Input data from command-line arguments and environment variables flow through subprocess output parsing, leading to file operations (copy), which depend on external command outputs and environment state.",
  "anomalies": "Uses environment variable 'BLST_WRAP_CPP_PREBUILD' to determine file copying; no hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code performs file copying based on external command output but contains no obfuscated code or malicious control flow. No suspicious network activity or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads input from command-line arguments and environment variables, then executes external commands ('swig -version', 'node --version') and parses their output. It uses this output to conditionally generate or copy files. The code includes straightforward file operations and subprocess calls. It does not contain any code that connects to external servers, exfiltrates data, or performs malicious actions. The use of subprocess and environment variables is typical for build scripts, not malicious activity. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or backdoors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate build helper script that manages file copying and generation based on tool versions and environment variables. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard build process with no suspicious or harmful logic.",
