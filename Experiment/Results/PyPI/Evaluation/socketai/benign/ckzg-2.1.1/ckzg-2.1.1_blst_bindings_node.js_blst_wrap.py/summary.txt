  "conclusion": "The script is a standard build utility for generating Node.js bindings, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is low, primarily related to reliance on external inputs, which is typical for such scripts. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a conservative risk score of 0.2 is appropriate."
