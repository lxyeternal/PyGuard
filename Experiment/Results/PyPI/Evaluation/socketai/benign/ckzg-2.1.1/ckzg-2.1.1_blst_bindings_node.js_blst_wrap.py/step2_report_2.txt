  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code with the described logic, and assess the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code primarily performs build automation: copying files, invoking external tools ('swig' and 'node'), and performing version checks.\n- No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code is present.\n- External inputs (sys.argv, environment variables) are used without sanitization, but this is typical for build scripts, not inherently malicious.\n- The subprocess calls are standard for build tools, with version checks guiding conditional logic.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n**1. Presence of malicious activity?**  \nAll reports agree that no malicious activity or backdoors are detected. This aligns with the code, which is a typical build script.\n\n**2. Obfuscation?**  \nAll reports assign obfuscated = 0, which is correct.\n\n**3. Malware score?**  \nAll reports assign malware = 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**4. Are the issues in the code?**  \n- The code does not contain vulnerabilities like command injection, as inputs are not sanitized but are used as-is in subprocess calls and file operations. However, this is typical for build scripts; unless inputs are maliciously crafted, this isn't an immediate concern.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- The environment variable 'BLST_WRAP_CPP_PREBUILD' is used to override files, which could be exploited if an attacker controls the environment, but this is a common pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justifications and Recommendations:\n\n**Malware score:**  \nAll reports correctly assign 0. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \nAll assign 0; justified.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- The reports assign 0.1 or 0.2, citing reliance on external inputs and environment variables, which could be manipulated in malicious environments.\n- Given the code's purpose and behavior, a risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable, but not higher, unless there are known external threats.\n\n**Scores per report:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\nThese are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code could be improved with input validation to prevent potential issues if inputs are maliciously crafted.\n- The use of subprocess without sanitization is a common concern but not necessarily malicious here.\n- No evidence of supply chain compromise or malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard build script with no malicious intent or activity. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No changes are necessary unless specific external threats are identified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No malicious or obfuscated code detected.  \n- The risk score could be marginally increased if external input validation is a concern, but as-is, 0.2 is reasonable.  \n- The malware score remains at 0.  \n- Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Accept the current assessments; no modifications needed.",
