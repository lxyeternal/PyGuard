{
  "purpose": "This script automates the generation and copying of C++ binding files for Node.js using SWIG, based on version checks and environment variables.",
  "sources": "sys.argv inputs, environment variable 'BLST_WRAP_CPP_PREBUILD', subprocess outputs from 'swig -version' and 'node --version'",
  "sinks": "File copying operations, subprocess calls to 'swig' and 'node', printing to stdout/stderr",
  "flows": "Inputs from sys.argv and environment variables influence file copying and subprocess commands; subprocess outputs determine version-based logic",
  "anomalies": "Use of external inputs without validation, reliance on environment variables for file paths, no input sanitization, typical for build scripts but potential exploitation point if environment is malicious",
  "analysis": "The code performs version checks for 'swig' and 'node', copies files based on environment variables and version logic, and handles errors appropriately. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present; subprocess calls are standard for build automation. The reliance on external inputs without validation could be exploited in malicious environments, but this does not constitute malicious intent or activity. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or backdoors. Overall, the script is a benign build helper with minimal security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard build utility for generating Node.js bindings, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is low, primarily related to reliance on external inputs, which is typical for such scripts. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a conservative risk score of 0.2 is appropriate.",
