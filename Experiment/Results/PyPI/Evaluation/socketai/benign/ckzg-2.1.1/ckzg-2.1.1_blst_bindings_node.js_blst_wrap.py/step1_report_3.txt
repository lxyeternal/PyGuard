{
  "purpose": "This script manages the building and prebuilding of C++ bindings for a Node.js environment, using SWIG and Node.js version detection to determine build steps.",
  "sources": "Reads command line arguments (sys.argv), environment variables (BLST_WRAP_CPP_PREBUILD), subprocess outputs (swig and node versions), and file system state (file existence, copying files).",
  "sinks": "File copying operations (shutil.copyfile), subprocess commands execution (subprocess.check_output, check_call), output to stderr, process exit codes.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and file checks influence whether files are copied or rebuilt. SWIG version output influences build commands. Node version determines which prebuilt source file is used, then copied to a target location.",
  "anomalies": "Uses environment variables to determine prebuilt files; copies files based on version checks without validation of source content; no explicit validation of file contents. No evident obfuscated code or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment-based decision logic for building C++ bindings, with subprocess calls to external tools (swig, node) and file operations. It handles different Node.js versions to select appropriate source files. Error handling appears standard. No hardcoded credentials or malicious network activity are present. The script relies on external tools and files, but does not execute or include code that appears malicious. The operations are typical for build scripts, with no suspicious or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a build helper for C++/Node.js bindings, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It mainly performs file operations, subprocess calls, and version checks. There are no malicious payloads or backdoors detected.",
