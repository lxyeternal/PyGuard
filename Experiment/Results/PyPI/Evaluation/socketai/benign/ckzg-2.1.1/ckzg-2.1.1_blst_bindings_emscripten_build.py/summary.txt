  "conclusion": "The script is a standard build automation tool for cryptographic WebAssembly bindings, with some obfuscation and environment-dependent behaviors. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The primary concern is the cloning from an unverified local source, which could be risky if the source is compromised, but in a trusted environment, this is acceptable. The obfuscation techniques are typical for build scripts and do not indicate malicious intent."
