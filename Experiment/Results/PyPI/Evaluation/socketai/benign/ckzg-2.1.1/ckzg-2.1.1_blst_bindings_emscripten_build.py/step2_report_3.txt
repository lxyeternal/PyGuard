  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script automates building WebAssembly bindings for 'blst', checks environment, prompts user, clones from `/blst`, runs Docker, generates code, performs regex-based variable renaming.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior identified; cloning from a local directory `/blst` is unusual but not inherently malicious. The variable renaming via regex could be used to obfuscate malicious code, but in context appears to be a legitimate renaming step.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, no malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, with emphasis on code generation, environment checks, cloning, and obfuscation tactics.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity; cloning from `/blst` again, with code generation and renaming. No network activity or secret data.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0.3, Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just build automation with some obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focus on building and generating bindings, cloning from `/blst`, executing build commands.\n- **Findings:** No malicious payloads; standard build process. The cloning from a local directory is suspicious but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate build script, no malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar process, environment validation, code generation, renaming modules, no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No malware, no network activity, just build automation with minor obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0.2, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe build script, no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Automates building bindings, code generation, renaming modules, no malicious payloads.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malware or malicious activity; standard build process.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Trusted build process.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code is a build automation script for cryptographic WebAssembly bindings.\n- **Malware suspicion:** None of the reports find evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** Minor renaming techniques are used but are typical in build scripts for avoiding naming conflicts or for obfuscation, not malicious hiding.\n- **Cloning from `/blst`:** Unusual but not malicious per se; could be a local source repository.\n- **External commands:** Use of subprocess calls to build tools is standard in such scripts.\n- **Potential risks:** The main concern is the ability to manipulate external sources or environment, but nothing indicates malicious intent.\n\n### Final scores:\n\n- **Malware:** Given all evidence, **0** (no malware detected).\n- **Obfuscated:** Slightly above zero due to renaming; **0.2** seems appropriate.\n- **Risk:** Overall low, but with potential for environment-based manipulation; **0.2** remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no evidence of malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.2** — minor renaming, typical in build scripts.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — standard build automation, low risk, assuming trusted sources.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate build automation script for cryptographic WebAssembly bindings. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or exfiltration routines are evident. The minor obfuscation and local cloning are typical in such contexts but should be reviewed if sources are untrusted.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the malware score at 0, obfuscation at 0.2, and risk at 0.2, consistent with the detailed analysis.",
