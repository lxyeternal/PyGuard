  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward initialization script for the 'kitchen' module.\n- The code only performs import statements, calls to setup functions with static strings, and defines version information.\n- No untrusted input, network activity, file I/O, or external data processing is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- The license comments and author metadata are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the code being clear and straightforward.\n- Security risk scores are very low (0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the nature of the code.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting the consensus that this code is benign.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- None of the reports mention any suspicious patterns or assumptions that could be challenged.\n- The code does not contain any dynamic or runtime behaviors that could be exploited.\n- The use of static strings and standard library functions further reduces concern.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a benign, standard initialization script for a Python package. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep the scores as they are: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is safe, non-malicious, and well within standard practices for open-source module setup.",
