  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module initialization script for the 'kitchen' package.\n- They emphasize that the code only imports modules, sets up internationalization via static calls, and defines version info.\n- No untrusted input, external data, network activity, or data sinks are identified.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are reported or evident.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**Confirmations and discrepancies:**\n- The code is indeed a standard setup script with no malicious code or backdoors.\n- The reports are consistent in their assessments, and their confidence levels are high.\n- The only minor point is that one report assigns a small security risk (0.1), likely due to the general caution about code that sets up internationalization, but this is not justified by any actual vulnerability.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n- Risk score: mostly 0, with one report at 0.1. Since the code is benign, the risk score should remain at 0.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- No issues are present in the code that would justify a higher risk or malware score.\n- The reasoning in the reports is sound; they do not overstate potential vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary; the evaluation aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a standard, harmless module initialization script for setting up localization and versioning. The assessments and scores are appropriate, and there are no security concerns to raise.",
