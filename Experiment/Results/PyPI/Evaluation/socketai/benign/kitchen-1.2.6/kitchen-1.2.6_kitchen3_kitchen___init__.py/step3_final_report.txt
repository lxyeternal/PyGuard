  "purpose": "Initialization and setup of internationalization and version information for the 'kitchen' module.",
  "sources": "Static strings in function calls, import statements, and version info definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, user input, or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Static data used in setup functions; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static setup code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, sets up internationalization with static strings, defines version info, and specifies exports. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is clear, well-documented, and follows standard practices for open-source module initialization. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard initialization script for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward and safe design.",
