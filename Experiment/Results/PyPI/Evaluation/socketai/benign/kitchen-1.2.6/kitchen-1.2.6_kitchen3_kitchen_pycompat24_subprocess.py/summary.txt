  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility shim with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and the security risk score can stay at 0.1 to reflect the minimal risk associated with deprecated compatibility code. Overall, the code is benign and well-understood, with no security concerns."
