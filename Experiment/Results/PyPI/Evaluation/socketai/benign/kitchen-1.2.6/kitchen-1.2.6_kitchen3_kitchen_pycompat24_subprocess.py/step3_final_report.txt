  "purpose": "Compatibility for subprocess across Python versions, providing deprecation warnings for outdated modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'kitchen.pycompat27.subprocess' and the deprecation warning message.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static imports and warnings are used.",
  "flows": "Import from compatibility module to the namespace; warning issued to the user.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can pollute namespace but is common in compatibility code; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a compatibility layer between Python 2.7 and 3, importing subprocess functions and issuing a deprecation warning. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is present. The use of 'import *' is typical in such contexts and does not indicate malicious intent. The deprecation warning is standard practice. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as no malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscated score is also correctly 0, given the code's clarity. The security risk score is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the deprecated compatibility code, but it does not pose a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility shim with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and the security risk score can stay at 0.1 to reflect the minimal risk associated with deprecated compatibility code. Overall, the code is benign and well-understood, with no security concerns.",
