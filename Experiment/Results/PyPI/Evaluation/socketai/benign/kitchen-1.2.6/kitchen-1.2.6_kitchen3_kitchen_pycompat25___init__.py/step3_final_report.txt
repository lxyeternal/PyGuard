  "purpose": "Issue a deprecation warning for the 'kitchen.pycompat25' module, guiding users to use Python 3 standard library features, and define version information.",
  "sources": "Static import of 'warnings' and 'kitchen.versioning', setting version info variables, and defining '__all__'. No untrusted data or external input involved.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import warnings trigger upon module load; no data flow from external sources to sinks; static code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward. The '__all__' includes 'collections', which is not defined here, but this is not a security concern.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a static deprecation warning, imports a versioning function, sets version info, and defines exports. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or execute malicious code. All components are standard and benign. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero, consistent with the code's behavior. The confidence score is 1, given the straightforward nature of the code and the absence of any malicious or risky elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard deprecation warning module with no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
