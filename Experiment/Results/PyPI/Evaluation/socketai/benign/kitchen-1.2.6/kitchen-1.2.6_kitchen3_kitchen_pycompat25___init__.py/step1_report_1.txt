  "purpose": "This module provides deprecated compatibility functionality for Python 2.5, guiding users to use the standard library instead.",
  "sources": "The code reads the warning message string and the imported module 'kitchen.versioning'.",
  "sinks": "The warning function outputs to standard error; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The warning message is triggered immediately upon import, but involves only static strings, and the imported module is presumed safe.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected. The module uses a warning warning only deprecation, with no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a deprecation warning related to Python compatibility, importing a versioning function, defining version info, and exposing an API component. All operations are standard, with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for deprecation warning and version info management, with no malicious or security concerns identified. It is safe and straightforward.",
