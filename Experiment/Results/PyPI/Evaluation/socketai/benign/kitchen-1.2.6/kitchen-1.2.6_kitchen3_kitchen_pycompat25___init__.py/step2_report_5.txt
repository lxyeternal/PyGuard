  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code issues a deprecation warning upon import, informing users that `kitchen.pycompat25` is obsolete in Python 3.\n   - It imports a versioning function `version_tuple_to_string` from an internal module.\n   - It defines version info variables (`__version_info__` and `__version__`).\n   - It exports `('collections',)` in `__all__`.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - The code only performs standard operations: issuing a warning, importing a function, setting variables.\n   - No external data sources, user input, network activity, cryptography, or data processing occurs.\n   - The warning message is static, hardcoded, and not influenced by external input.\n   - The imported module `kitchen.versioning` is presumed safe; no indication of malicious code there.\n   - No obfuscation, code injection, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Report**:\n   - All reports consistently identify the code as a straightforward deprecation notice and version info setup.\n   - No anomalies, malicious intent, or security risks are detected.\n   - The scores assigned (`malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`) are appropriate and justified.\n\n4. **Scores Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score (0)**: No malicious activity or code; only a warning and version info.\n   - **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Clear, simple code with no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score (0)**: No security risk; the code is benign.\n\n5. **Potential for Higher Risk or Malware**:\n   - Since the code is static, does not process untrusted data, and performs only benign operations, there's no basis for increasing the scores.\n   - The warning is a standard deprecation message, not an attack vector.\n\n6. **Consistency and Validity**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - The analysis in all reports aligns with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (No malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (Code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score**: **0** (No security risk)\n\n**Additional comments**:\n- The code is a typical deprecation warning module, with no security concerns.\n- No further action needed; the code is safe.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation, and presents no security risk.",
