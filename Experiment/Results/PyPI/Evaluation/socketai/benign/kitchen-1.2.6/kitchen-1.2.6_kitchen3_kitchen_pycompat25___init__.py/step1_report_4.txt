{
  "purpose": "The module provides compatibility functions for Python 2.5, mainly related to the standard library and versioning information.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the imported module 'kitchen.versioning' and the warning function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The warning function call is executed at import time, but it does not involve untrusted data. The imported function 'version_tuple_to_string' is called with a hardcoded version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code only issues a deprecation warning and sets version variables.",
  "analysis": "The script issues a deprecation warning regarding the module's usage, which is standard practice for deprecated modules. It imports a function to convert version tuples to strings and sets version info variables. No user input, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are observed. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple deprecation notice and version info setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is standard, non-malicious code for maintaining compatibility and informing users.",
