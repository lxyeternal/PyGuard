  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the details.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code's purpose is to issue a deprecation warning about the 'kitchen.pycompat25' module, guiding users to use Python 3 standard library features instead.\n- It imports a versioning function, sets version info, and defines an export list.\n- No external input, network activity, cryptography, or data processing is involved.\n- The warning message is static and hardcoded.\n- No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, with confidence level 1.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. It performs straightforward deprecation warning and version info setup.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** None identified. The code is standard and correctly implemented.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware: 0 — no malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n  - Security risk: 0 — no security vulnerabilities or risky operations.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:** None, as the code is benign.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly assigned as 0; no malicious behavior.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The reports correctly identify that there are no vulnerabilities based on the static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical analysis:\n\n- The code issues a deprecation warning upon import, which is standard practice.\n- It imports a versioning function from an internal module, presumed safe.\n- No external data, user input, or external communication is involved.\n- The static warning message and version info are safe and typical for such modules.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a benign, standard deprecation notice with no security concerns.\n\n**Final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis module is safe, straightforward, and does not pose any security threat.",
