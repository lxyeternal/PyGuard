  "purpose": "Provide deprecation warning and version information for the kitchen.pycompat25 module, which implements compatibility functions for Python 2.5.",
  "sources": "The module imports 'warnings' and 'version_tuple_to_string' from 'kitchen.versioning'. The warnings.warn function uses a static string message.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any untrusted data inputs, nor does it write or transmit data. It only issues a deprecation warning.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: static warning message is issued during module import, with no external input or output manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code structures, or suspicious behaviors. The code is simple and standard for deprecation notices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports warnings and a version conversion function, then issues a deprecation warning to inform users about the module's status. It sets version info and exports a list. No external data handling or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be a benign deprecation notice with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard deprecation warning module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply informs users about the module's deprecation status and version info, with no suspicious or harmful operations.",
