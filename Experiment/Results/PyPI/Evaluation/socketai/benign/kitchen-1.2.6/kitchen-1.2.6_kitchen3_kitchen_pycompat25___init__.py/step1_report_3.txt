{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions for Python 2.5, specifically related to the kitchen.pycompat25 module, and issues a deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports modules and sets variables internally.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the only flow is internal variable assignment and a warning issuance.",
  "anomalies": "The code issues a deprecation warning but does not contain any suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports warnings and issues a deprecation warning about a compatibility module. It then imports a versioning function and sets version information variables. There are no external inputs, no network activity, and no dangerous code constructs. The warning and version setting are standard practices and do not suggest malicious intent. The overall structure is simple and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard deprecation notice and version info setup. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
