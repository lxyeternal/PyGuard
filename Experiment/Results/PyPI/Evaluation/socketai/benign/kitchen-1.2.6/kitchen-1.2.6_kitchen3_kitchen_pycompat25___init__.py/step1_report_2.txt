{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions for Python 2.5, specifically related to the 'kitchen' package, and issues a deprecation warning indicating it is obsolete in Python 3.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it imports a versioning function from an internal module and defines module-level variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The only flow involves the import of 'version_tuple_to_string' and setting version information, which do not involve untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a warning about deprecation but no unusual or suspicious code behavior. The warning is for deprecation, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a versioning function, sets version info, and issues a deprecation warning about the module's obsolescence. No user input handling, no network activity, no cryptography, or data processing occurs. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility and deprecation notice module with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
