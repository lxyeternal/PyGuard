  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, issuing a deprecation warning and setting version info.\n- No external data, user input, network activity, or cryptography is involved.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present.\n- The code is standard for a deprecation module, with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: a warning upon import, importing a versioning function, defining version info, and exposing an API component.\n- The warning message is static, no untrusted data involved.\n- The imported function appears safe.\n- No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or malicious flaws are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The purpose and analysis are consistent with the code.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Set to 0; no security risk identified.\n- **Confidence:** 1, justified by the straightforward analysis.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- No reason to increase malware or risk scores; the code is benign.\n- The deprecation warning is standard practice, not malicious.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- No discrepancies in their reasoning or scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security threat.\n- The deprecation warning is appropriate and does not introduce any vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
