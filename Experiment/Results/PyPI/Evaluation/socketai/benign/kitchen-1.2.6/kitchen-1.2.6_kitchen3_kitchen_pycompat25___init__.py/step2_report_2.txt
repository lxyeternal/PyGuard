  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step to determine the accuracy of the security assessments.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `warnings` and a versioning function `version_tuple_to_string`.\n- Issues a `PendingDeprecationWarning` immediately upon import with a static message.\n- Defines version info variables.\n- Exposes `__all__` with `'collections'` (though no such object is defined in the snippet).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Observations:\n- The code performs only standard operations: issuing a deprecation warning, importing a function, setting variables.\n- No external or untrusted data is processed.\n- No network, cryptography, or data handling occurs.\n- No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The warning message is static, and all imported modules are internal or standard library.\n\n### Logical and Security Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports. This is accurate; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0. The code's purpose is to warn about deprecation; it does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Potential Issues or Flaws:\n- The only minor concern is the `__all__` containing `'collections'`, which isn't defined in the snippet. However, this is not a security concern but perhaps a code completeness or correctness issue. It does not impact security.\n\n### Validity of the Reports:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and solely for deprecation warning purposes.\n- The reasoning that there are no suspicious behaviors, external data handling, or malicious intent is sound.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** The current scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n- **Additional Notes:** The code is safe, and its purpose is transparent and standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a simple, benign deprecation warning module with no security concerns. The reports' assessments are accurate and well-founded.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the code's straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, and the reports correctly identify it as such. No further security concerns or suspicious activity are present.",
