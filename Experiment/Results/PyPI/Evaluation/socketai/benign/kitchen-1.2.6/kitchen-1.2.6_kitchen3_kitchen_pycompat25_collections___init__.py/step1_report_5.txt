  "purpose": "To provide a deprecated wrapper for collections.defaultdict for backwards compatibility with older Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statement from collections module, warnings.warn calls indicating deprecated usage",
  "sinks": "Warnings output, potentially logging or displaying deprecation notices",
  "flows": "Import of defaultdict from collections -> instantiation of the defaultdict class -> issuing of deprecation warnings",
  "anomalies": "The code mainly issues deprecation warnings and wraps existing standard library functionality; no suspicious or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a warning about deprecated compatibility modules, then imports defaultdict from the standard collections library. It defines a subclass that issues a warning upon initialization, indicating deprecation and guiding users to use the standard library directly. The class is a simple wrapper with no additional logic or behavior. No external input handling, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The warnings serve informational purposes only. Overall, the code maintains backwards compatibility without introducing malicious behavior or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward deprecation wrapper for Python 2.5 compatibility. It issues warnings to users but does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and purely informational.",
