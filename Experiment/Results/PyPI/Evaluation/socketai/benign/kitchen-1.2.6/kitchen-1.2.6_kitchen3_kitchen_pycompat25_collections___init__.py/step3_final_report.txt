{
  "purpose": "This code provides a deprecated wrapper around collections.defaultdict for backward compatibility, issuing warnings to inform users about deprecation.",
  "sources": "Import warnings module, import defaultdict from collections, class instantiation of the subclass.",
  "sinks": "Warnings issued via warnings.warn during module load and class instantiation.",
  "flows": "Import warnings and defaultdict -> class constructor -> warnings.warn call.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward deprecation handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports warnings and defaultdict, defines a subclass that issues deprecation warnings upon import and instantiation, and calls the superclass constructor. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or malicious code. The purpose is solely to inform users about deprecated modules/classes. No obfuscation, backdoors, or security-sensitive operations are present. The warnings are informational, and the code adheres to standard practices for deprecation notices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard backward compatibility shim with no malicious intent or security risks. It issues deprecation warnings but does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
