  "purpose": "To provide a deprecated alias for collections.defaultdict for backward compatibility with older Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'collections.defaultdict' and the __init__ method of the custom defaultdict class, which issues warnings.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or write data externally.",
  "flows": "Import of defaultdict → Instantiation of custom defaultdict → Warning issuance (informational, not harmful). No data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings to deprecate features, but no malicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'defaultdict' from 'collections' and creates a subclass that issues deprecation warnings. The warnings serve to inform users about deprecated usage but do not perform any harmful actions. The class simply calls the superclass constructor. There are no external data sources, no malicious behaviors, or suspicious code flows. The code is purely for backward compatibility and includes standard practices for deprecation warnings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, backward compatibility shim that issues deprecation warnings without performing any malicious or security-sensitive actions. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
