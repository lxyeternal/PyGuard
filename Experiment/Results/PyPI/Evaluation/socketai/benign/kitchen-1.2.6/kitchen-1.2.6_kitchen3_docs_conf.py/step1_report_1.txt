  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building documentation with Sphinx for the 'kitchen' project.",
  "sources": "Imports 'sys', 'os', and 'kitchen.release' modules; accesses 'kitchen.release' attributes for project info.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data, executes external commands, or handles untrusted input sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code mainly defines static configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static configuration variables for Sphinx documentation build. It imports standard modules and project-specific release info, then sets various options related to HTML, LaTeX, and intersphinx configurations. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no network activities or data leaks. The only external data references are static URLs and project metadata. Overall, the script appears safe and intended solely for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration file for Sphinx documentation. It contains no malicious code or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward, static, and solely for setup purposes.",
