  "conclusion": "The code is a standard localization compilation script with no malware or obfuscation. The primary security risk is command injection via unvalidated external configuration data. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is moderate (~0.4). To mitigate this, input validation or sanitization should be added before constructing command arguments."
