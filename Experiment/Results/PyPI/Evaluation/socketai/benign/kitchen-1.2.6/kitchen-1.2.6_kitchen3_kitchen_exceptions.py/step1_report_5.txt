  "purpose": "Define custom exception class for the 'kitchen' project to handle errors uniformly.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations; no data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output operations; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths, as the code only declares an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected; standard licensing and class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments, a class definition for a custom exception, and an all-encompassing __all__ declaration. It is a straightforward, standard Python module for exception handling with no data input/output, network operations, or other risky behavior. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign exception class definition with proper licensing. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified. It poses no security risks.",
