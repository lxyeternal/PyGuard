  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code is a minimal, straightforward Python module defining a single custom exception class `KitchenError`.\n   - It contains license headers, author info, and a docstring explaining its purpose.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data processing, external dependencies, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The class is a simple subclass of `Exception` with no additional methods or attributes.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The code appears to be boilerplate for a larger project, serving as a base exception class.\n   - No data flow, input/output, network activity, or external interactions are involved.\n\n3. **Assessment of Risks and Scores:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Given the absence of any malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious patterns, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, well-commented, and straightforward. No obfuscation is evident, so a score of 0 is justified.\n   - **Security Risk / Overall Risk:** Since the code is purely structural, with no security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors, a low risk score (close to 0) is warranted.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws in the Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - They uniformly assign scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a risk score of 0.5 or below, which seems reasonable.\n   - No report overestimates the threat level; all are consistent.\n\n5. **Summary and Final Assessment:**\n   - The code is a typical, benign exception class definition with appropriate licensing and author comments.\n   - There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, standard boilerplate, and poses no security threat.",
