  "analysis": "This code is a minimal class definition for an exception class used in a larger project. It contains license information, author attribution, and a single class extending Exception with no additional logic. There are no input sources, output sinks, or data flow. No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign definition of a custom exception class with no malicious or security-related issues.",
