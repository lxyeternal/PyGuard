  "purpose": "Define base exception class for the 'kitchen' project and include licensing information.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reading functions present.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or operations that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely declares a class and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. License headers and class declaration are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of license headers, author information, a documentation string, and a single custom exception class inheriting from Exception. It is purely structural and does not perform any data processing or external interactions. No source or sink points, no data flow, and no suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a standard boilerplate for exception handling within a project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard exception class definition with proper licensing headers. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
