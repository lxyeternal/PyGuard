  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code is a minimal, straightforward Python module defining a single custom exception class `KitchenError`.\n   - It contains license headers, author info, and a docstring explaining its purpose.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - No obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The code matches the described purpose: defining a base exception class for the 'kitchen' module.\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n   - The code is standard boilerplate for exception handling, with no anomalies.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These are appropriate given the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which aligns with the clear and unambiguous nature of the code.\n\n4. **Critical Evaluation**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is purely structural.\n   - The license headers and author info do not introduce any security concerns.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment & Recommendations**:\n   - The code is a benign, standard exception class definition.\n   - No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n   - The scores reflect the true nature: no malware, no obfuscation, no security risk.\n\n**Final Summary**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' assessments.",
