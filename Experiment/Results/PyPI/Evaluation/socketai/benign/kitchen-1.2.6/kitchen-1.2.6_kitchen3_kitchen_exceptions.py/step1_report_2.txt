  "purpose": "Define base exception classes for the kitchen module, providing a custom exception hierarchy.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static code defining classes and comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely declarative code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard license headers, no obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of license headers, author info, documentation, and a simple custom exception class 'KitchenError'. It contains no input handling, data output, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The structure is straightforward and standard, with no signs of malicious activity or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module defining a base exception class with license and author comments. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
