  "purpose": "Define a base exception class 'KitchenError' for the 'kitchen' module, including licensing and author information.",
  "sources": "License headers, author comments, class definition",
  "sinks": "None; no input/output, data flow, or external interactions",
  "flows": "None; code is static class definition without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class with standard comments and licensing",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static class definition for a custom exception with extensive licensing and author comments. It contains no input/output operations, data processing, external dependencies, or dynamic code. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is typical boilerplate for exception handling, serving as a base exception class. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, reflecting the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard exception class definition with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are accurate and consistent with its benign nature.",
