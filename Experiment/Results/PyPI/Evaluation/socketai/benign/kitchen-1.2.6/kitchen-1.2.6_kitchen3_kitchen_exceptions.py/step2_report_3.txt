  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal class definition for a custom exception (`KitchenError`) with license headers and author info. There are no input/output operations, data flows, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Potential Issues & Anomalies:**  \n   None of the reports mention any suspicious or malicious constructs. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic code, or hidden behaviors. This aligns with standard boilerplate code for exception handling.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasoning:**  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct since there's no malicious activity or code.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports assign zero across malware and security risk, and the code is simple, there is no justification for higher scores.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify that this is a standard, benign exception class definition.\n\n6. **Consistency & Appropriateness:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n\nThis code snippet is a typical, benign component of a larger project. It contains no suspicious elements, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The consistent zero scores across all reports are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe provided reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a simple, standard exception class with no security concerns. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
