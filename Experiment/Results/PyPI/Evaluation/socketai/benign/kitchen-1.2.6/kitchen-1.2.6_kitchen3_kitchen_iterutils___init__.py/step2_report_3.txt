  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a benign utility module providing functions for iterable handling.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows that could lead to security issues are identified.\n- The code relies on external modules for versioning and string type checking, but these are standard and do not introduce security concerns.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious logic are present.\n- The functions are straightforward, well-documented, and serve a clear purpose.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not execute system commands, handle untrusted input directly, or communicate externally.\n- The only potential concern might be the `include_string` parameter, but it is used internally for type checking and does not process untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores assigned are mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Most reports assign 0 or very low (0.1). Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0.0 or 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n- One report assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1, citing the code as \"standard utility functions\" with no evident issues. This is acceptable, though arguably, the risk is effectively 0.\n- The other reports assign 0, which seems more accurate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, benign utility module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n- The assigned scores are reasonable, though slightly conservative in some cases.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Justification:**\n- No code execution, data leaks, or malicious logic.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- The functions are safe, well-documented, and do not handle untrusted external data in a way that could cause harm.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a benign utility module for iterable handling, with no security risks or malware. The current scores in the reports are aligned with this assessment, though a risk score of 0 might be slightly more precise than 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the context in which such utility code is used. In isolation, it poses no security threat. In a larger application, security depends on how and where these functions are integrated, but based solely on this code, it is safe.",
