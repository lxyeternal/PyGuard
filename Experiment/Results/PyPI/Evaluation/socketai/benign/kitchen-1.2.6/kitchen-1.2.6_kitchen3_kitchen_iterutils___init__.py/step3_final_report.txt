  "purpose": "Utility functions to check if an object is iterable and to generate an iterable from any object, facilitating flexible iteration in Python code.",
  "sources": "The functions read input objects passed as parameters to 'isiterable' and 'iterate'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not perform external I/O or data handling beyond type checks.",
  "flows": "Input objects flow into 'isiterable' and 'iterate' functions; these functions process the data locally without external influence or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, well-documented, and uses standard Python constructs. No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for iterable handling, relying on external modules for versioning and string type checks. It does not execute system commands, handle untrusted input in a risky way, or perform network or file I/O. The functions are simple, safe, and serve a benign purpose. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk near 0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate; no modifications are necessary.",
