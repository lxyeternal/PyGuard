  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward package metadata module, importing `_` and `__version__` from the `kitchen` module, then defining constants.\n   - No dynamic code execution, no data leaks, no external network activity.\n   - The import of `_` and `__version__` is typical for localization and versioning.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues or malicious activity are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious patterns.\n   - They note the import of internal variables, which is standard practice.\n   - No false positives or overlooked issues are evident.\n   - **Conclusion:** The reports' reasoning is sound.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, appropriate given the code's clarity.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), reflecting the reviewers' certainty.\n   - **Suggestion:** Scores seem reasonable and consistent; no adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - All scores are 0, indicating no risk.\n   - If any score were above 0.5, it would require justification, but this is not the case here.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions—no network, no code injection, no data exfiltration.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n   - **Conclusion:** The malware score is accurate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not rely on assumptions; they base their conclusions on static code analysis.\n   - The import of `_` and `__version__` is standard, not suspicious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.\n   - No anomalies or inconsistencies detected.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall Justification:**\n\nThe code is a simple, static metadata module with no dynamic or malicious elements. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores reflect the benign nature. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Score | Justification                                                  |\n|-------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0            | No malicious activity or code behavior detected.             |\n| Obfuscated        | 0            | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.             |\n| Security Risk     | 0            | No vulnerabilities or risky behavior observed.              |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code and reports are aligned, and the security assessment is that this is a safe, benign package metadata module.",
