  "purpose": "Define metadata and descriptions for the 'kitchen' Python package.",
  "sources": "import statement for 'kitchen', usage of '__version__', string literals for package info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no external data output or processing points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static metadata definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains static package metadata such as name, version, description, author info, and URLs. It imports a version variable from a local module and uses localization functions for descriptions. There are no network operations, data handling, or code execution that could be malicious. No anomalies or signs of obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as package metadata without any malicious intent or security risks.",
