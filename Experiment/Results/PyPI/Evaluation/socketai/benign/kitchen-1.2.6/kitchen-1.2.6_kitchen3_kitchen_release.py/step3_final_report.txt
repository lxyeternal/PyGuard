{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata including name, version, description, author info, URLs, and license for the 'kitchen' Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports '_', '__version__' from the 'kitchen' module; static string assignments for package info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data only.",
  "flows": "Import of '_' and '__version__' from 'kitchen' (potential source), used in static variable assignments (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; import of localization and version variables is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module defining package metadata with imports from its own package. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The import of '_', likely a localization function, and '__version__' are typical. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior detected. All signals point to benign, straightforward code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static package metadata module with no malicious intent or security risks. The import statements are standard, and the code contains no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
