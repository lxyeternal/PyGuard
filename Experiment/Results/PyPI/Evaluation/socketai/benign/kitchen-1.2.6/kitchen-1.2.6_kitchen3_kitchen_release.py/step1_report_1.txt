{
  "purpose": "This code provides metadata and documentation for the 'kitchen' Python package, including description, author information, and version details.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing '_', '__version__' from 'kitchen' module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to data leaks or security effects",
  "flows": "Import of '__version__' and '_' from 'kitchen' module (potentially dynamic), then data assigned to constants",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code; no obfuscation or malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static string assignments for package metadata. The only dynamic aspect is the import of '_', '__version__' from the 'kitchen' module. If these are properly defined in 'kitchen', this is standard behavior. There are no indications of malicious activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The code does not perform any external network communication, file manipulation, or execution of untrusted code. It is a straightforward metadata module.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign metadata module for the 'kitchen' package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
