  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is primarily static metadata with a dynamic import of `_` and `__version__`. It notes no malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the standard nature of the import and static data. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates the benign nature, with no external data handling or suspicious code. The import of `__version__` and `_` is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, no malicious activity or obfuscation. The import is from the same module, which is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Also straightforward, with no signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is a simple metadata module with no dynamic or suspicious behavior. The import of `_` and `__version__` is common in Python packages for localization and versioning.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, reflecting no security risk.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is benign, static, and straightforward.\n- The import of `_` and `__version__` from the same package is standard practice.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's content.\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a safe, standard package metadata module with no security concerns.",
