{
  "purpose": "Define metadata and descriptive information for the 'kitchen' Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from kitchen import _, __version__'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets constants and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement imports underscore '_' and '__version__' from 'kitchen', which are likely internal variables. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata such as name, version, description, author info, URLs, and license. The only potential concern is the import of '__version__' and '_' from the 'kitchen' module, which could be used to dynamically determine version info. However, this is a common practice in Python packages and does not indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code is static and straightforward. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. No external data sources, no sinks processing untrusted input, and no code that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard metadata module for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports version and localization functions, then defines constants for package information.",
