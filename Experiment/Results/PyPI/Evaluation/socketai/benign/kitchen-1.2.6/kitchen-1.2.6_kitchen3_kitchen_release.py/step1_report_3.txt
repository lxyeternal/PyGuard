  "purpose": "To provide metadata and description for the 'kitchen' Python package, including version, description, author, and related info.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from kitchen import _, __version__'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no external data handling or untrusted outputs.",
  "flows": "Import of '__version__' and '_' (possibly a translation or localization function) from the package; uses imported variables to set constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; the code appears to be straightforward package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports version and translation functions from its own package and defines package metadata constants. There are no external data inputs, network connections, or code execution mechanisms. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present. The code's structure is simple and conventional for a package __init__.py or metadata module. The import of '__version__' and '_' is standard practice and not suspicious. No anomalies detected that suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package metadata file with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It serves its purpose of defining package information clearly and safely.",
