  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward package metadata module.\n   - The only dynamic elements are the imports of `_` and `__version__` from the `kitchen` module, which are standard practices for localization and versioning.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior and Anomalies**:\n   - No report indicates any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n   - The code does not perform any network communication, file manipulation, or code execution.\n   - The import of `_` and `__version__` is typical for Python packages and not suspicious unless the imported module is malicious, which cannot be determined solely from this snippet.\n\n3. **Flow and Data Handling**:\n   - The data flows are minimal and only involve static assignments.\n   - No untrusted data is processed or outputted.\n   - The import sources are internal to the package, not external or untrusted.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), reflecting the benign assessment.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns**:\n   - The only slight concern is the import of `_` and `__version__` from `kitchen`. If these are manipulated or maliciously altered in the actual package, that could pose a risk. However, based on this code alone, there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n   - The code is very static and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a typical package metadata module.\n   - No anomalies, malicious activity, or security risks are evident.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n7. **My Final Estimation**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n   - **Risk score**: 0.1 (very low, just standard package metadata, no security concern)\n\n**Summary**: The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, and I agree with them.",
