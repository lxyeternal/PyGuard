{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a static module defining imports, class aliases, and export symbols for the AWS Global Accelerator SDK interface, primarily for use as a library or SDK stub.",
  "sources": "The code reads no untrusted input; it imports classes from local modules and defines constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows or could cause data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and does not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the copyright year '2025', which is in the future but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static setup for an SDK interface, with no dynamic operations, network calls, or data processing. It imports classes, sets an alias, and defines __all__ for exports. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The documentation is static and for informational purposes only. The future copyright year is likely a placeholder or typo, not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and serves as a boilerplate SDK interface with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
