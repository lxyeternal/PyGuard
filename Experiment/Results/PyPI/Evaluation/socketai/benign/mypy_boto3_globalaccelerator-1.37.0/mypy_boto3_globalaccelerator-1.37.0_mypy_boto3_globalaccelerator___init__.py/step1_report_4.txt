{
  "purpose": "Provide an interface for interacting with the AWS Global Accelerator service, including importing necessary classes and setting up client and paginator objects.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), inline documentation, and module-level definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no external data processing or output.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code primarily consists of imports, variable assignments, and module exports without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a structured interface module that imports specific classes and functions from internal modules, assigns a class alias, and defines what symbols to export. It includes comprehensive inline documentation and example usage, but no dynamic code execution, network calls, or sensitive data handling. The overall structure is typical for an SDK wrapper, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard interface module for AWS Global Accelerator, with no malicious or suspicious behavior observed. It is well-structured, with clear documentation, and contains no evident security concerns.",
