{
  "purpose": "Define and export a main interface for interacting with AWS GlobalAccelerator service, including importing dependencies and setting up a client and paginators.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), and code defining client and paginator variables.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing, no network or file operations, no sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "The code sets up class imports and defines a client alias, without any data flow involving user input or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected. The copyright date appears unusually recent (2025), but this alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes and functions, assigns a class to a variable, and exports these via __all__. It appears to be a straightforward module setup for a larger SDK or project, with no dynamic execution, no network calls, and no processing of untrusted input. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code structure is clear, and all operations are standard for a Python SDK interface module.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as an interface module for AWS GlobalAccelerator, with no indications of malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It is a well-structured, benign code snippet intended for SDK use.",
