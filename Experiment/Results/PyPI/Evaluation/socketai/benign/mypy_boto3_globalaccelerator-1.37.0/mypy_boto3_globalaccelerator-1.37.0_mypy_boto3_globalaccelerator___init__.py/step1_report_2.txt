{
  "purpose": "To provide an interface and import statements for interacting with the AWS Global Accelerator service using boto3 and related paginator classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), code comments, and docstring containing usage examples.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable usage are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and defines aliases and exports, without any data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are detected. The code is standard interface boilerplate for a boto3 client.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, a documented usage example, and module exports. No user input handling, no data processing, nor any suspicious code execution is present. The usage example is a straightforward boto3 client setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden code, or security issues within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module providing interface setup for the AWS Global Accelerator SDK. It contains no malicious logic, no suspicious behaviors, and appears to be standard boilerplate code for AWS service interaction.",
