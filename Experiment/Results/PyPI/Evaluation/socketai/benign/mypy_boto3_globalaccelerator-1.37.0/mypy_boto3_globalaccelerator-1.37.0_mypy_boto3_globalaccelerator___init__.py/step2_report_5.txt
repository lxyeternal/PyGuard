  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and evaluating the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a static module that imports classes and functions related to AWS Global Accelerator SDK, defines an alias, and exports these symbols.\n- The included documentation provides usage examples but does not execute any dynamic code.\n- There are no network operations, file I/O, user input handling, or any dynamic data processing.\n- The code appears to be boilerplate setup for an SDK interface, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose:** Accurate; describes the code as an interface for AWS Global Accelerator.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned; no issues.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose:** Correct; similar to Report 1.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no suspicious activity.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Consistent; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose:** Similar; interface setup.\n- **Analysis:** No issues; code is standard.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose:** Same as others.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; the recent copyright date (2025) is unusual but not suspicious.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency:\nAll reports agree that the code is benign, static, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final thoughts:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nGiven the code's nature, I agree with the provided assessments. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a standard, benign SDK interface module.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
