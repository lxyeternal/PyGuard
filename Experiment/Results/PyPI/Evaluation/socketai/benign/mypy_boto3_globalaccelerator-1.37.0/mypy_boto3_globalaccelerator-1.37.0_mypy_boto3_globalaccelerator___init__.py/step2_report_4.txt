  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is static, primarily import statements, documentation, and module setup. No dynamic or untrusted data handling, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound, and the scoring is reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it notes the code is boilerplate for AWS SDK interaction, with no suspicious logic or data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is straightforward, importing classes, setting up a client alias, and exporting symbols. No data processing or external interactions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, with detailed reasoning confirming no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Well-founded.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; standard SDK interface code with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is static, import/setup boilerplate for an SDK, with no dynamic data handling, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** All zero, correctly reflecting no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Zero, since there are no vulnerabilities, data leaks, or insecure practices.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely static module setup for AWS SDK interaction, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The documentation and usage examples are standard and do not introduce any vulnerabilities.\n- The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or handle secrets.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured SDK interface boilerplate, with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
