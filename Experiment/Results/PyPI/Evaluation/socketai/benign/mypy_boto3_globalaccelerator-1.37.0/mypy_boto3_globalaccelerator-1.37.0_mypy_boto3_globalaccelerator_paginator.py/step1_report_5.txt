{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations and paginators for the boto3 globalaccelerator service client, enabling type-safe pagination over AWS globalaccelerator resources.",
  "sources": "The code reads input and data primarily from method parameters in the 'paginate' functions and from imported modules such as 'sys', 'typing', 'botocore.paginate', and local type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the 'paginate' methods, which could process untrusted data if improperly used, but no direct data leaks, network connections, or malicious actions are evident in the code itself.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method parameters in 'paginate' methods (source) to their processing within the method (sink), but the implementation details are omitted (no actual network or data handling code), so no malicious flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and follows standard pattern for boto3 paginators. The inclusion of version checks and type annotations appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginators with proper type annotations for safe pagination. It imports standard libraries and local type definitions without any suspicious modifications. The code adheres to typical patterns for type hinting and conditional imports based on Python version. No suspicious logic, data manipulation, or malicious constructs are detected. The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or data collection beyond type definitions and method signatures.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of boto3 paginators with type annotations for improved static analysis. It contains no malware indicators or security risks. It is a typical library code module without malicious intent.",
