  "purpose": "Type annotations for globalaccelerator service client paginators.",
  "sources": "Method parameters via **kwargs, type definitions imported from type_defs",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; methods only pass parameters to parent classes",
  "flows": "paginate methods receive kwargs and pass them to the parent paginate implementation",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes with type annotations for boto3's globalaccelerator client, following standard patterns. It uses conditional imports for compatibility and overrides the paginate method primarily for type hinting. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The structure is consistent with auto-generated SDK stubs, and no signs of malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of boto3 paginator type annotations. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious elements. The current malware score of 0 and risk score of approximately 0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
