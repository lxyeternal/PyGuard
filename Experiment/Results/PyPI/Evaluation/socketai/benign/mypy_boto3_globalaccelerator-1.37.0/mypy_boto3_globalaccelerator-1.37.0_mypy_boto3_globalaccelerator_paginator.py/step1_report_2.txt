{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and paginator classes for the AWS GlobalAccelerator client in boto3, facilitating paginated API responses with type safety.",
  "sources": "The code reads type definitions from imported modules, sys module for Python version checks, and standard library modules for typing. No external input sources or user data are directly read.",
  "sinks": "No code indicates data being sent over the network, written to files, or exposed to untrusted sources. The paginator methods are standard and only wrap boto3 API calls.",
  "flows": "The code defines paginator classes that accept **kwargs of specific types, calling the base Paginator's paginate method, returning PageIterator objects with response types. No suspicious data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code constructs. The code strictly defines type annotations and class structures for pagination; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured implementation of boto3 paginator classes with precise type annotations for responses and requests. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, clearly documented class methods, and adheres to standard patterns. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are present. The code appears to serve as a type-safe interface for AWS SDK pagination, with no indicators of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured set of paginator class definitions for AWS boto3 with type annotations. It does not contain any malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It functions solely as an interface layer, with no suspicious signals.",
