  "purpose": "Define paginators for the AWS Global Accelerator service client with type annotations for better type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, import statements, and class definitions including 'paginate' methods.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods calling the base Paginator's 'paginate' with **kwargs; no data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "User calls 'paginate' with parameters; these are passed to the base 'Paginator' class which returns a 'PageIterator' with response data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected. The code strictly defines paginator classes with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple paginator classes for the 'globalaccelerator' service, each inheriting from a generic 'Paginator' with specific response types. It uses conditional imports for 'Unpack' based on Python version, and sets up type checking with 'TYPE_CHECKING'. The 'paginate' methods override the base method but only call the parent implementation, providing proper type hints. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure is consistent, and the purpose aligns with enhancing type safety for AWS SDK paginators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured set of type-annotated paginator classes for boto3's 'globalaccelerator' service, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
