  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation & Functionality**  \n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line input.  \n   - No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data sources are involved.  \n   - The logic is straightforward and standard.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Elements**  \n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected.  \n   - No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior is evident.  \n   - The copyright date (2025) is in the future, which might be a typo or placeholder, but this is not malicious.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification**  \n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.  \n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.  \n   - The security risk score is 0, as no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Concerns**  \n   - No issues are identified; the code is purely informational.  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**  \n   - The code is safe, benign, and does not pose any security risks.  \n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the code's benign, informational nature. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple, non-malicious CLI utility with no security risks or suspicious behaviors. The reports' evaluations are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
