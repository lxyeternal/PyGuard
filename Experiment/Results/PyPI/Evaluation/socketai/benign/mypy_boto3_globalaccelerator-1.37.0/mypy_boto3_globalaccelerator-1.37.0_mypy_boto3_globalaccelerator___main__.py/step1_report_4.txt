  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package providing informational output about boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for printing info and version data.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) triggers output to stdout (sys.stdout.write).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic CLI functionality: printing package info or version based on command-line arguments. It does not perform network operations, execute dynamic code, or handle untrusted data beyond reading sys.argv. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The structure and content are straightforward and align with typical utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility for informational purposes, with no malicious or security concern evident. It appears safe and does not include any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
