  "purpose": "A simple CLI script that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; no external data sources or user input beyond args.",
  "sinks": "Outputs static text to sys.stdout; no untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) leads to printing static info or version; no dynamic data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; the copyright year is future-dated (2025), likely a placeholder, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that prints static information based on command-line input. It involves no dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data fetching. The logic is simple, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The future copyright date is noted but not relevant to security. The code's simplicity and static nature justify the low scores. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with its behavior.",
