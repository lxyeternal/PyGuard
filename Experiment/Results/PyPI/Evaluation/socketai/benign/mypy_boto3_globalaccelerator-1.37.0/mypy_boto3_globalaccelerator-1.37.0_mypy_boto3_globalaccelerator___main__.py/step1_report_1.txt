  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. The copyright date is in the future, but this is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI tool that outputs package info or version. It reads command-line arguments, then prints static information to standard output. No external data sources, network activity, or insecure practices are present. No obfuscated or malicious code detected. The logic is simple, with clear, standard Python code. No signs of supply chain attacks, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a simple CLI utility for displaying package information and version, with no suspicious behavior.",
