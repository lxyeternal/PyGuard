  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version.\n- It processes command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) to determine whether to print version info (`--version`) or package info.\n- It writes output to `sys.stdout`.\n- There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data handling beyond printing static text.\n- The copyright date is in the future (2025), which is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No. The code functions as described and contains no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Malicious code or malware?**  \n  No. The code is purely informational, with no obfuscated or suspicious logic.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward.\n\n- **Supply chain attack indicators?**  \n  No. No external data fetching, no code injection, no suspicious dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\nAll five reports agree that:\n- The code is benign.\n- It only outputs static info.\n- No suspicious patterns or behaviors are detected.\n- The purpose is purely informational.\n\n**Errors or flaws in reasoning?**  \n- No. All reports correctly identify the script as benign.\n\n**Scores given:**\n- Malware: 0 in all reports.\n- Obfuscated: 0 in all reports.\n- Security risk: 0 in all reports.\n\nThese are reasonable given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for any higher risk scores:\n- The code is safe, with no external data, no dynamic execution, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behaviors.\n- The only potential concern could be the future copyright date, but that is not a security issue—more likely a placeholder or typo.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since all reports are consistent and accurate, no adjustments are necessary.\n- The code is a benign CLI utility with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code is safe, straightforward, and poses no security threat. The scores reflect that accurately.",
