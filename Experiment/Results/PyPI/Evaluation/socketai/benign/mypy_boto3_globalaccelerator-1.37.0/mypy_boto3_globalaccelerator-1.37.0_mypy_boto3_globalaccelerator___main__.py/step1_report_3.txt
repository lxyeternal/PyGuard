{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI entry point for a package that provides informational output about the boto3 GlobalAccelerator package, including version details and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv, particularly checking for '--version'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout via sys.stdout.write().",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' flows from sys.argv to the conditional check, leading to print_version() output, otherwise print_info() output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and informational.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys to handle command-line arguments and output. It defines functions to print package info and version. The main() function checks for '--version' argument and calls the appropriate print function. The script executes main() if run as the main module. All output is static and informational, with no external data fetching, no malicious code, no network activity, and no user data handling. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs package info and version details. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no security risks, and is safe to use. It appears to be a benign informational script.",
