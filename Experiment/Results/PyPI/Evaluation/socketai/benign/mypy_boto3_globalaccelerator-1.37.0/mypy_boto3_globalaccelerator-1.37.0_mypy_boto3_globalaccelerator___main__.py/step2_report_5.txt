  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Security Risks:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info or version details.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or network activity are detected.\n   - The code does not process untrusted input beyond reading command-line arguments, which is standard and safe here.\n   - The copyright date is in the future (2025), which might be a typo or placeholder, but this is not malicious.\n\n2. **Code Logic and Behavior:**\n   - The code reads `sys.argv` to check for `--version` and then prints static information accordingly.\n   - All output is static and informational.\n   - No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Anomalies:**\n   - The only anomaly noted is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n   - No other issues are present.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a simple, benign CLI utility.\n   - No signs of supply chain attack, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The scores given are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or suspicious features.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, and the scores are appropriate. No further action needed.",
