{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and data structures for the AWS Global Accelerator service, primarily used for static type checking in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'sys' module for Python version info, and imports various types and literals from local modules and standard libraries. No external user input or external data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not send data over networks, write to files, or execute commands. It solely defines data types and constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code strictly defines types and data structures without runtime data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes conditional imports based on Python version, but no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are detected. The presence of a copyright notice with a future date (2025) is a benign stylistic or documentation choice, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions and constants for a specific AWS service SDK, intended to support type checking. It avoids any dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The conditional imports for compatibility are standard practice. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely declarative, defining type annotations and data structures for a Python SDK. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured type definitions module for AWS service integration.",
