  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Content:**  \n   All reports consistently identify that the code is solely a set of type definitions for the AWS Global Accelerator SDK, using TypedDict and conditional imports for compatibility. No reports mention or imply any malicious code, backdoors, obfuscated logic, or data leaks.\n\n2. **Code Functionality and Data Flow:**  \n   The code is static, defining data schemas and constants. There are no runtime behaviors, external data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. This aligns with the purpose of type annotations and documentation.\n\n3. **Indicators of Security Risks:**  \n   No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard practice for compatibility, not malicious obfuscation.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not highlight any assumptions that could lead to vulnerabilities. They recognize the code as purely declarative.\n\n5. **Scores Justification:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.  \n   - **Risk Score:** Given the above, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Additional Observations:**  \n   - The copyright year is 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date, but this is likely a stylistic or placeholder choice, not an indicator of malicious intent.  \n   - The code is well-structured, documented, and adheres to best practices for type annotations.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions for the AWS SDK.  \n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.  \n- The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0  \n\n- **Overall Security Assessment:**  \n  The code is safe, with no indicators of compromise or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the current assessments and see no need for adjustments. The code is purely for type safety and documentation, with no security concerns.",
