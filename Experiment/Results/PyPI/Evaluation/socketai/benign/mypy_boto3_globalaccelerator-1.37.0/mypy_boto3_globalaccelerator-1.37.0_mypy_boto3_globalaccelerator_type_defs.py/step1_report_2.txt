{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations for various data structures used in the AWS Global Accelerator service SDK, facilitating type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from external modules (e.g., sys, datetime, and local literals) and defines data structures with type annotations. No user input or external data sources are directly read within these definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks (e.g., network calls, file writes, or eval/executed code) are present. The code is purely data structure definitions and imports.",
  "flows": "The code sets up type definitions that would be used downstream in actual SDK functions; it does not contain executable logic or data flow from source to sink within this file.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard for type definitions; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present. All code serves to define types and imports.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines numerous TypedDict classes that model the data structures for the AWS Global Accelerator SDK. It includes conditional imports based on Python version to ensure compatibility, but no executable logic or data manipulation occurs here. The code is structured and documented, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. No data leaks, network activity, or code injections are evident. It appears to be a legitimate part of an SDK's type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for the AWS SDK. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The purpose is purely to facilitate type checking in a larger SDK context.",
