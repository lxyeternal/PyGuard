  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, sources, sinks, data flows, anomalies, and overall security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The code is a set of type definitions for the boto3 AWS Global Accelerator SDK, using TypedDict for data schemas. No dynamic code, network activity, or external data processing is present.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is purely declarative for type checking.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are correctly at 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on data structure definitions for the SDK. No executable logic or external data handling.\n- **Findings:** Standard type annotations, no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk at 0, matching the assessment.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, type annotations for AWS SDK data structures. No runtime code or data flow.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** Consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Static type definitions, no dynamic or external data processing.\n- **Findings:** No malicious patterns or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Correctly set to 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to others, defining data schemas for the SDK.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns.\n- **Scores:** Appropriately at 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe a static, well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK, with no executable logic, external data handling, or network operations.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Security Risk:** None present; the code is purely declarative.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The purpose of this code is to provide type annotations for better IDE support and type safety.\n- No dynamic code, external inputs, or outputs are involved.\n- The presence of conditional imports based on Python version is standard practice, not malicious.\n- The copyright date in the future (2025) is likely a stylistic or placeholder choice, not suspicious.\n\n### Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security vulnerabilities or risks identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS SDK usage in Python, with no indicators of malicious activity or security concerns.",
