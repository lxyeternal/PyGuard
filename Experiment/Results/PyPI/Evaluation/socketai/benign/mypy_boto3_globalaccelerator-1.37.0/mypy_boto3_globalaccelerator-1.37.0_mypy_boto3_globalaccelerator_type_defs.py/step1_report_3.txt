{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for the AWS Global Accelerator service SDK in Python, providing structured data types for API interactions.",
  "sources": "The code primarily sources data from parameters passed to function calls and type annotations for API request/response structures.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the usage of data from untrusted sources in request parameters, but no direct data leaks or malicious actions are evident from type definitions alone.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into API request structures; no runtime data processing or untrusted data handling is explicitly shown in this static code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be standard type annotations and structured data definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of Python TypedDict definitions and type annotations, aimed at modeling AWS SDK data structures for the Global Accelerator service. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, but no executable logic, network calls, or data processing. The content is purely declarative, establishing data formats. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident in the static type definitions. The imports and structure are consistent with typical SDK type declaration files. Overall, it functions as a schema or interface description without dynamic or runtime components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type definition module for AWS SDK interactions, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks detected. It is purely declarative and adheres to best practices for type annotations in Python.",
