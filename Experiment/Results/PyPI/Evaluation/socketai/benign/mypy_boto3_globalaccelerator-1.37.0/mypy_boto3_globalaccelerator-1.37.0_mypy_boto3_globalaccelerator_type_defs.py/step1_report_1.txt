  "purpose": "Type definitions for the globalaccelerator service for use with boto3 stubs, facilitating type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily from annotations, imported modules, and type hints. No direct input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output or network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks, as the code solely defines types and data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code strictly defines data structures using TypedDict and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for the boto3 globalaccelerator service, using TypedDict to specify data schemas. It imports standard modules and conditional typing extensions to ensure compatibility across Python versions. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or suspicious constructs are present. All code appears to serve the purpose of type hinting and documentation, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions intended for type checking and documentation purposes. There are no indicators of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks within this code snippet.",
