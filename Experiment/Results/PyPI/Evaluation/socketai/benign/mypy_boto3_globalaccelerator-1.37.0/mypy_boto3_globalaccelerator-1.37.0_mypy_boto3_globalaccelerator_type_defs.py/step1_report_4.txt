  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS Global Accelerator service data structures to facilitate type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, and local modules; type definitions for data structures using TypedDict and NotRequired annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data sinks present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks that could lead to security vulnerabilities; mainly static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; use of conditional imports based on sys.version_info is standard for compatibility, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides detailed type annotations for AWS Global Accelerator API data structures, including request/response formats. It uses conditional imports for Python version compatibility and defines various TypedDict classes for structured data. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data manipulations; the code is purely declarative. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The primary function is to support type checking in client code.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard type definition library for AWS SDK in Python, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It strictly contains static type annotations to aid development and does not perform any runtime operations that could be exploited or malicious.",
