  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: code content, potential security issues, anomalies, and scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:**  \n  The code is purely type definitions for the AWS Global Accelerator SDK, using TypedDict, with conditional imports for Python compatibility. No dynamic code, network activity, or external data processing is present.\n\n- **Findings:**  \n  No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is standard for type hinting and documentation.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct, no malicious code.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct, code is clear and straightforward.  \n  - Risk: 0 — Correct, no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAccurate assessment. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:**  \n  Similar to Report 1, it defines data structures for the SDK, with no executable logic. It uses conditional imports and type annotations.\n\n- **Findings:**  \n  No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The code is purely declarative.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — Correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:**  \n  Same as above, focusing on data structure definitions with no runtime logic.\n\n- **Findings:**  \n  No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — Correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAccurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:**  \n  The code is a set of static type annotations, with no dynamic or runtime code. Uses conditional imports for compatibility.\n\n- **Findings:**  \n  No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The presence of a future date in the copyright notice (2025) is likely a stylistic or documentation choice, not suspicious.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — Correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAssessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:**  \n  Similar to others, defining type annotations and constants, with no executable logic or external data handling.\n\n- **Findings:**  \n  No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security concerns. The use of conditional imports and version checks are standard practices.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — Correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe evaluation is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions for the AWS SDK. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious code detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Clear, standard type annotations.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security risks, as the code is purely declarative.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe, and well-documented set of type definitions for SDK type checking, with no indicators of malicious intent or security issues.",
