{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type definitions for the AWS Global Accelerator SDK, facilitating type checking and documentation in Python projects. It defines data schemas using TypedDict, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. No executable logic, network activity, or external data processing is present.",
  "sources": "The code reads type annotations, constants, and conditional imports based on Python version. It does not read external input or data sources at runtime.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data flows into potentially malicious operations. The code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "No data flows or runtime execution paths exist; the code only defines data schemas and constants.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the future date (2025) in the copyright notice, which appears to be a stylistic or placeholder choice, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of static type definitions for the AWS SDK, with conditional imports for compatibility. It contains no executable code, network activity, or data processing. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores are consistent with its benign, declarative nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions for the AWS SDK, with no indicators of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, aligning with the analysis.",
