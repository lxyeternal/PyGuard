{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS Global Accelerator service, facilitating type-safe API interactions.",
  "sources": "Code imports, class definitions, method signatures, property declarations, and overloads that define client behavior and API calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows include API request parameters, response handling, and exception propagation, but no untrusted input or external data handling is explicitly implemented.",
  "flows": "Method calls (e.g., add_endpoints, delete_accelerator) imply input-to-output flow, mostly through method parameters and return types; no suspicious or dynamic data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. The code appears to be a standard boto3 client stub with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive stub defining a client class for the AWS Global Accelerator API, including method signatures with type hints, overloads for paginators, and exception definitions. It follows standard patterns for boto3 stubs, providing type safety without executing any logic. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or backdoors are present. The code structure and content are consistent with a legitimate SDK interface, focusing solely on type definitions and method signatures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate and standard AWS SDK stub for the Global Accelerator service, with no indications of malicious activity or security risks. It strictly defines the client interface and types, with no evidence of sabotage or harmful behavior.",
