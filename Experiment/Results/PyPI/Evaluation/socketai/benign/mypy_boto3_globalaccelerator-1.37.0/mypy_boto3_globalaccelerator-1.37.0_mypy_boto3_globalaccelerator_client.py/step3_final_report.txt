{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type annotations and class definitions for the AWS GlobalAccelerator client, serving as an SDK stub for static analysis and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Method signatures accepting **kwargs, imported type definitions, and class attributes; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Parameters are used internally by boto3; no data is processed or sent to external sinks within this code.",
  "flows": "Method parameters flow into API request calls; no dynamic data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; standard pattern for SDK stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, static interface for the AWS GlobalAccelerator client, with method signatures, overloads, and exception types. It contains no executable logic, network activity, or data handling that could be malicious. The extensive use of type annotations and **kwargs is typical for SDK stub files, aimed at static type checking. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate, benign SDK stub designed for static analysis and IDE support. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) are consistent with its purpose and content.",
