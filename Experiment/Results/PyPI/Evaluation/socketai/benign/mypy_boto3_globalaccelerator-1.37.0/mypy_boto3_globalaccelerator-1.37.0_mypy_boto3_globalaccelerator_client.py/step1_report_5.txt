{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definition for the boto3 GlobalAccelerator client, providing a strongly-typed wrapper for AWS SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Code imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; property and overload declarations.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that call AWS APIs via boto3; no data sinks or untrusted data processing observed; no external network or file operations explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Method calls originate from user code calling the client methods, which internally invoke AWS API requests. No external or untrusted data flows identified within the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code primarily consists of type annotations, method signatures, and documentation links. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured type stub for the boto3 AWS SDK, defining client methods, exceptions, and overloads with clear documentation links. It does not contain executable logic beyond method signatures and type annotations. No anomalies, malicious behaviors, or security risks are evident. The primary purpose is to facilitate static type checking and IDE support, with no runtime or malicious activity embedded.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type annotation stub for the AWS GlobalAccelerator boto3 client. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely as a type hinting interface for static analysis and developer assistance.",
