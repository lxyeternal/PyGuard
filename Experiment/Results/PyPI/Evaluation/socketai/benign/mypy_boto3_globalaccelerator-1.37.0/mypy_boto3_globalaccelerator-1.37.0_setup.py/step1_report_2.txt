{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-globalaccelerator' to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, imports setup from setuptools, and uses hardcoded package data and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling; primarily static data and file reading.",
  "flows": "Reads local file for description -> passes static data to setup() -> no external data flows or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no network or file manipulation beyond reading static files.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration with static package metadata, dependencies, and documentation links. It reads a README file for long description and defines package data and requirements. There are no dynamic inputs, external network calls, or code that could be exploited. The code adheres to typical setup.py conventions and does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
