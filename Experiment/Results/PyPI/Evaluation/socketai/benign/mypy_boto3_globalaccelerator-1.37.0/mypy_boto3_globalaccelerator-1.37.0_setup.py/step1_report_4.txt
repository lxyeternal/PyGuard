  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the mypy-boto3-globalaccelerator Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of README.md file, static package configuration data, and package dependencies specified in the script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the script primarily handles static configuration and file reading.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content -> passes static configuration data to setup() function -> installs dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a markdown file for the long description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No code injection, no use of eval/exec, no network connections, and no hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The dependencies are static and safe. Overall, the script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign setup script for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks.",
