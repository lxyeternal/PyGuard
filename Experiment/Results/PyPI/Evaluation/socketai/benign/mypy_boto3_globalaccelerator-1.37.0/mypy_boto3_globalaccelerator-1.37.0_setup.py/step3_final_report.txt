{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, defining package metadata and reading a README for the long description.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for description; static metadata fields in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from file read into setup() parameters; no dynamic or external data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward, conventional setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static setup.py script that imports necessary modules, reads a README file, and calls setup() with fixed metadata. There are no dynamic behaviors, network activities, or code obfuscation. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero. The structure and content pose no security threats or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup script is entirely benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious code. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
