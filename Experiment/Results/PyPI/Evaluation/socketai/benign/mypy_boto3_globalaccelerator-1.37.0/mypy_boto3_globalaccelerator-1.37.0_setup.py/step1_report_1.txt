{
  "purpose": "The script sets up the package 'mypy-boto3-globalaccelerator' for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the __file__ attribute to locate README.md for long description, and imports data from setuptools and pathlib modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no external data processing or network operations occur.",
  "flows": "Reads file content (README.md) and passes static package metadata to setup() function; no dynamic or untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is a standard setup script with proper licensing and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical package setup procedure: importing modules, reading a markdown file for the long description, and calling setup() with static parameters. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. All data appears to be static and intended for packaging purposes. The license, author info, and URLs seem legitimate. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign Python package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
