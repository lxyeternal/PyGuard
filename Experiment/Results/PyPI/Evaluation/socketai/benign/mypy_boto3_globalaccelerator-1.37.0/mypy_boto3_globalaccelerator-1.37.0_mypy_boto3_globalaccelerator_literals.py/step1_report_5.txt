{
  "purpose": "Defines type literals for AWS Global Accelerator service and other AWS service names for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Type annotation definitions, string literals for various AWS service and resource names, and conditional import based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code primarily defines constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The code is straightforward type annotation definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to check Python version and conditionally imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions. It defines multiple Literal type aliases representing AWS service names, resource names, and specific string literals for service configurations. The __all__ variable specifies exported names. No dynamic code execution, no input handling, no external data processing, and no suspicious logic are present. The structure is purely declarative, serving as a type definition module for type checking purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This module contains static type annotations and string literal definitions for AWS services and related constants. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. It appears to be a benign utility module for type safety. No security risks identified.",
