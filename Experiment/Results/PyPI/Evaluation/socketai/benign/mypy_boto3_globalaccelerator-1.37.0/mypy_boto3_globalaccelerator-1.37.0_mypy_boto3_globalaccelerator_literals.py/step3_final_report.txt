{
  "purpose": "Static type annotations for AWS GlobalAccelerator resource states, service names, and related constants, intended for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals, conditional imports based on Python version, and lists of string constants.",
  "sinks": "None; static definitions only, no data flow or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Purely static; no runtime data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future year (2025) in the copyright statement, likely a typo or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type aliases and string literal lists for AWS resource states and names. It uses conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data handling, network activity, secrets, or obfuscated code. The only minor anomaly is the future year, which does not impact security. The code's purpose is to facilitate type safety and documentation. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static type annotation module for AWS SDKs, serving documentation and type safety purposes. It contains no malicious or obfuscated content, and no security risks are evident. The minor anomaly (year 2025) is a typo or placeholder, not a security concern.",
