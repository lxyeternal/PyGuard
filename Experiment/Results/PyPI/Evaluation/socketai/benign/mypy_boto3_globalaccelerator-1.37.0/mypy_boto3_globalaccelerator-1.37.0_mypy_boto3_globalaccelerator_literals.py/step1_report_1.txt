{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS GlobalAccelerator service and related resources to facilitate type checking in Python code.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded string literals assigned to type aliases, import statements, and the sys.version_info check for conditional import.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or affects system behavior; the code is solely for type annotations and constants.",
  "flows": "The code assigns string literals to type aliases; these are static definitions with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and mainly for type annotation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines multiple type aliases as string literal unions, representing valid values for various AWS resource states and identifiers. The code is purely declarative, used for static type checking, with no runtime logic or data processing. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static type definition module for AWS GlobalAccelerator and related resource identifiers. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It serves as a set of constants for type safety.",
