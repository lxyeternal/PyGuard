  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines static type literals for AWS GlobalAccelerator and related resource states.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely for static type checking, with no runtime logic or data processing. The inclusion of a future year (2025) is likely a typo or placeholder, but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully benign, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining string literal types for AWS services, with a Python version check.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic or external data handling, no suspicious patterns. The only anomaly is the future year in the copyright.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (slightly elevated but justified as a minor concern over the typo).  \n**Assessment:** No malicious intent, just a minor typo.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines literals for AWS parameters, with compatibility handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static, safe, no dynamic code or external interactions.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** Benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior, purely for type safety.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** Benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literals for AWS services and resource names.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static, no runtime logic, no external data, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static type annotations and constants for AWS resource names and states.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malware, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns are present in any report.\n- **Security Risks:** No runtime logic, no external data, no secrets, no backdoors.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All scores are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward and transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk, just static type definitions.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The only minor anomaly is the copyright year 2025, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not a security concern.\n- The code is intended solely for type safety and documentation purposes, with no runtime or dynamic behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain report accurately assesses the code as benign. The scores are reasonable and justified. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward, safe static type definition module with no security concerns.",
