  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code defines type literals for AWS GlobalAccelerator and related resources, sourcing from static string literals and import statements.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or dynamic data flow; static definitions only.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes an unusual future year (2025) in the copyright, which is likely a typo or placeholder, but not security-relevant.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurately describes the code as purely static type annotations with no malicious intent or security risks.\n- **Confidence & Malware:** Fully confident; malware score 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report's conclusion is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the code defines type annotations for AWS GlobalAccelerator literals, with a sys version check for importing 'Literal'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or dynamic behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions the invalid future year (2025), which is not security-related.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately identifies the code as benign static type setup, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence & Malware:** High confidence; malware score 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment; no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code defines string literals for AWS parameters, with conditional import.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Static definitions only.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, just large lists of constants.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly identifies the code as benign, serving for type safety.\n- **Confidence & Malware:** Full confidence; malware score 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, focusing on AWS Global Accelerator types and constants.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Static, no untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes the code is purely static type annotations.\n- **Confidence & Malware:** Fully confident; malware score 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as static type annotations for AWS services.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dynamic or untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; only static definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is benign, with no malicious intent.\n- **Confidence & Malware:** High confidence; malware score 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type annotations, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** None detected; the code is a standard type definition module for AWS SDKs, intended for type safety and documentation.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be **0**, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, a **0** is appropriate.\n\n**Additional notes:** The inclusion of a future year (2025) in the copyright notice appears to be a typo or placeholder, but it does not pose any security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a benign static type definition module for AWS SDKs, with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate in their assessments. The overall scores should be:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's purpose and structure.",
