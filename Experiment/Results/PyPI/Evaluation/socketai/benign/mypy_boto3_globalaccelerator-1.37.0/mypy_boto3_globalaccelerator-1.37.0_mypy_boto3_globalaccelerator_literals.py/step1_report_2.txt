{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations for AWS GlobalAccelerator service literals and related string literal types for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports 'sys' module for Python version check; defines multiple string literal types assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only assigns static string literals and conditional imports.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual aspect: inclusion of a copyright notice with an invalid future year (2025). No other anomalies detected. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type aliases using Python's Literal for AWS service identifiers and configuration states. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, which is a standard compatibility pattern. No dynamic execution, external data handling, or network activity is present. The large list of service names and resource identifiers appears to be for type safety and documentation, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign type annotation setup for AWS SDKs, with no evidence of malicious code or supply chain attacks. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are detected.",
