  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, potential security implications, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS GlobalAccelerator and related resources.\n- It uses conditional imports for `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility.\n- The data consists solely of type aliases and constant string lists.\n- No dynamic execution, data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors.\n- The purpose appears to be to facilitate type checking and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Define type literals for AWS GlobalAccelerator and related resources.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, static, for type annotations, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining type annotations for AWS resources.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Also correctly states that the code is benign, with a note on the invalid future year (2025) in the copyright. This is a minor anomaly but not security-related.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 (very low), Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable. The slight security risk score is justified as negligible; no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Define string literal types for AWS GlobalAccelerator.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes the code is static, for type safety, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous, for AWS Global Accelerator.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent, static definitions, compatible with multiple Python versions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Define AWS service and resource name literals.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, purely static type annotations.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary and Recommendations\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across the board, consistent with straightforward static code.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), justified by the mention of the invalid future copyright year, which is not a security issue but indicates a minor anomaly.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear static definitions)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks, just static type definitions)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a benign static type annotation module for AWS SDKs, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The slight security risk score in some reports is justified as negligible and not indicative of actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose effectively.",
