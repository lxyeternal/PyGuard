  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code defines type literals for AWS GlobalAccelerator, sourced from static string literals, import statements, and a version check.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or data flow; purely static definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes an invalid future year (2025) in the copyright—this is a minor oversight, not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; the code is purely for type annotations, with no runtime logic or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1. These are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The code is benign, and the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; defines type annotations for AWS services and states.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data; static constants.\n- **Anomalies:** The only unusual aspect is the future year (2025), which is a minor documentation oversight.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1 (a slight overstatement), Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Discussion:** The security risk score of 0.1 is perhaps slightly high given the benign nature, but still acceptable. The malware score is correctly zero.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious intent, just a minor documentation inconsistency. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar static type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** None; purely static.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard compatibility pattern.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly identified as benign, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; static literal definitions with version checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** None.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; the code is purely for static type safety.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; static type annotations for AWS services.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dynamic data or untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; the code is a straightforward static type module.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify zero malware risk.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all, appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n- **Risk Score:** All are at or near zero, which is justified. Slightly elevated in one report (0.1), but still acceptable.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk; only static type annotations.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, purely for type safety, with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this code is a benign static type definition module for AWS services, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.",
