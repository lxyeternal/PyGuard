  "purpose": "Define type annotations for literals used in the globalaccelerator service for improved type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions and import statements, including dynamic import based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code is purely defining constants and types.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily consists of static literal definitions and conditional imports; no suspicious code or unusual constructs are present. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script provides type aliases for various string literals associated with AWS Global Accelerator and other AWS services. It uses conditional imports for compatibility with different Python versions. No code executes untrusted input or performs network, file, or system modifications. All constructs are static and serve documentation or type checking purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, well-structured module for type annotations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is purely defining constants for type safety and documentation.",
