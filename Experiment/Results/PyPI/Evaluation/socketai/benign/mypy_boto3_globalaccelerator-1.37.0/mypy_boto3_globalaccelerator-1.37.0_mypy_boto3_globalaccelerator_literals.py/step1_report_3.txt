{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS Global Accelerator service parameters and related constants for type safety.",
  "sources": "The code sources string literals defining type annotations and module imports for type hinting.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; the code does not interact with external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; the code only establishes type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code primarily consists of static type definitions and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations using Literal for AWS service string parameters, ensuring type safety in client code. It conditionally imports Literal based on Python version, which is a standard compatibility approach. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data processing occurs. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The structure is straightforward, consisting of variable assignments to Literal types and an extensive list of string constants for AWS resource and service names.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static type definition module for AWS SDKs, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly improves code clarity and type safety without executing any untrusted or malicious actions.",
