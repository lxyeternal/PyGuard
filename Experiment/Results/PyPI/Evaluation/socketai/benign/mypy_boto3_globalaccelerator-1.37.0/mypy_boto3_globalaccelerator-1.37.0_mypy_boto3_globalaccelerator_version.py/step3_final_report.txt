  "purpose": "Declare the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of the string \"1.37.0\" to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static code with no external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a simple assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with comments and a version string.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to __version__, with no dynamic behavior, external inputs, or code execution. It is a standard pattern for version declaration in Python packages. No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The scores from the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code is entirely safe and typical for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The existing reports are accurate and appropriate; no modifications are necessary.",
