  "purpose": "Defines the version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string '1.37.0' to the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple metadata declaration for versioning, with a comment about the source of truth and a copyright notice. It contains no dynamic code, no data handling, and no external interactions. The __version__ variable is hardcoded and static, typical for package versioning. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as metadata for the package, and nothing suspicious is present.",
