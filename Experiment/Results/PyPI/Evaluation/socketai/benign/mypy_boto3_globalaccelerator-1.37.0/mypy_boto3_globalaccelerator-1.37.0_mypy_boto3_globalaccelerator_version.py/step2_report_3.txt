  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the underlying code:\n\n**Overall code review:**\n- The code is a simple assignment of a static version string to the `__version__` variable.\n- There are no dynamic elements, no input/output operations, no external data handling.\n- The comments and structure are standard for version declaration in Python packages.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is benign; it functions solely as metadata.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes in reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in describing the code as a straightforward version declaration.\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is also correct.\n- The security risk score is 0, justified given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- If any report had assigned a higher score, I would challenge it unless there was evidence of malicious intent.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is standard.\n- No signs of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The confidence level of 1 indicates certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code, I agree with the reports' assessments. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, benign version declaration.\n- All scores are appropriate.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is present.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code poses no security risks and can be considered safe.",
