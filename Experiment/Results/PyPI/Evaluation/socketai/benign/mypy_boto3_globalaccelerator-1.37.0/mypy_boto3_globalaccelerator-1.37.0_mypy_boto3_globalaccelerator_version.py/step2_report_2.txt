  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Logic Confirmation:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of a static assignment of the version string `\"1.37.0\"` to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no dynamic elements, no input/output operations, no external data sources, and no code execution beyond simple assignment.\n   - The code includes a comment indicating the source of truth and a copyright notice, which are benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that this is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` score = 0\n     - `obfuscated` score = 0\n     - `securityRisk` score = 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The highest scores are 0 for malware and security risk, which is justified.\n   - Since the code is static, simple, and contains no suspicious activity, higher risk scores would be unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - There is no indication of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward, static code analysis.\n   - No assumptions about hidden behavior are made; the assessment aligns with the code content.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence level of 1 reflects certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Personal Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks present.\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns.**",
