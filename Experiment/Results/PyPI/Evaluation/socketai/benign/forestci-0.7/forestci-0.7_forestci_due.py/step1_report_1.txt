{
  "purpose": "Provide a stub implementation for the duecredit citation framework, fallback when import fails.",
  "sources": "Import statements for duecredit modules, local variables, and class/function definitions.",
  "sinks": "No external untrusted data sources or output sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except to replace missing modules with no-op stubs; no malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a no-operation stub class and functions, and attempts to import the duecredit modules. If import fails, it assigns dummy functions and a stub class to prevent errors. No suspicious or malicious behavior, code injection, or data leaks are present. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted input. It simply provides fallbacks, which is typical for optional dependencies. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign stub implementation intended to replace the duecredit module if unavailable. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks.",
