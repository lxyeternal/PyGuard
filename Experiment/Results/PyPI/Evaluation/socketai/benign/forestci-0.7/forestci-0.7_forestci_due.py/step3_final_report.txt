{
  "purpose": "The code provides a fallback mechanism for optional dependency 'duecredit', defining no-op classes and functions to prevent errors if the package is not installed.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'duecredit' modules; assignment of fallback classes/functions upon import failure.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external output.",
  "flows": "Attempted import of 'duecredit' modules; fallback to inert classes/functions if import fails.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward fallback pattern with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import optional modules and assigns dummy classes/functions if unavailable, ensuring safe fallback. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The fallback classes are inert, and the import handling is standard. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, and high confidence. No anomalies or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard fallback for optional dependencies, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
