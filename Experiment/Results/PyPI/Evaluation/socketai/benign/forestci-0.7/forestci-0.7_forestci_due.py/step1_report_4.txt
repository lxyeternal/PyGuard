{
  "purpose": "This code provides a stub implementation and import fallback for the duecredit library, used for citation management in scientific Python code.",
  "sources": "Imports from the duecredit package, internal functions, and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Import statements lead to fallback definitions if import fails; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of fallback stubs to disable actual functionality if the library isn't available; no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import components from the duecredit package; if unsuccessful or if certain attributes are missing, it assigns stub classes and functions that perform no operations. The stub class '_InactiveDueCreditCollector' and '_donothing_func' are placeholders to prevent errors when the real library isn't present. No external data is processed, no network activity, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and intended for safe fallback behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign fallback implementation for the duecredit library, designed to disable citation features if the library is missing or incomplete. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
