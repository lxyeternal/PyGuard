{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions from internal modules related to forest confidence interval calculations and a version string, then defines public exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from .forestci and .version modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only performs static imports and module metadata assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of internal functions with underscores (_core_computation, _bias_correction) suggests these are private/internal; no signs of unusual code or hardcoded secrets. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely performs imports from local modules and sets __all__ for exports. The imported functions appear to be part of a legitimate package related to random forest calculations. The internal functions indicated by underscores are standard Python naming for private functions and do not suggest malicious intent. The version import is typical for package metadata. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module that re-exports specific functions and version info for a package related to forest confidence interval calculations. No malicious or security-threatening code is evident.",
