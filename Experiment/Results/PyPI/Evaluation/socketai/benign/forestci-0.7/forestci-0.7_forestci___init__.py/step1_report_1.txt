{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions and variables from local modules related to forest confidence intervals and versioning, and exposes selected functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions from .forestci and version modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are evident in this code fragment",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and defines __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behavior are present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, importing functions related to forest confidence interval computations and version info. It also defines __all__ for export control. There are no input reading, data processing, or data leaks. No suspicious or malicious constructs are evident. The imported functions are presumably from the package's internal modules and are not inherently malicious. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module import and export setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a minimal, straightforward configuration file typical for Python packages.",
