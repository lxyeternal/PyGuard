  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is a simple import/export setup with no suspicious activity. No anomalies, malware, or security risks identified.  \n- **Assessment:** Completely benign. The code is just re-exporting functions from internal modules. No issues here.  \n- **Scores:** The malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis. No obfuscation or risk concerns.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard import/export pattern with no suspicious behavior. Internal functions with underscores are typical for private/internal functions.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The code appears standard and safe.  \n- **Scores:** Malware score 0, consistent with the analysis.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Re-exports from internal modules, no external data handling or malicious patterns. The use of underscores for internal functions is normal.  \n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent. The code is straightforward.  \n- **Scores:** Malware score 0, appropriate.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern—importing functions, including private ones, with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, just internal module setup.  \n- **Scores:** Malware score 0, consistent.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar import/export pattern, no external input or suspicious constructs. The presence of private functions in imports is typical for internal module structure.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious or security issues.  \n- **Scores:** Malware score 0, appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence of malware or malicious behavior:** No. All reports confirm the code is just re-exporting internal functions and version info, with no signs of obfuscation, external communication, or malicious constructs.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None detected. The code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or suspicious patterns, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted. The code is essentially a benign module setup.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analyses provided in each report, which consistently indicate a benign, standard import/export pattern with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a minimal, standard module re-export setup with no signs of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The scores should all be zero, reflecting the benign nature of this code snippet.",
