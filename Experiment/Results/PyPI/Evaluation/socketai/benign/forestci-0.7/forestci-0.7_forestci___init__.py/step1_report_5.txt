{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module import and export setup for a package related to forest confidence interval calculations and version management.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.forestci' and '.version'. No external input data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks identified; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "The only noteworthy point is the import of functions with an underscore prefix (private functions) from '.forestci'. No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and a version string from local modules. The imported functions include both public and private identifiers, which suggests internal module structure. The __all__ variable exports only the public functions, aligning with standard practice. There are no code injections, external communications, or obfuscated code. The presence of private functions (_core_computation, _bias_correction) in imports might indicate internal implementation details, but this is not inherently malicious. Overall, this is a straightforward module setup with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import/export setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply exposes certain functions for external use, with no evident malicious or suspicious activity.",
