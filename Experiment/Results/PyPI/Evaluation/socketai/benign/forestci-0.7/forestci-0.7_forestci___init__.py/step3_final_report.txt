{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing specific functions and version info to define the public API of the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.forestci and .version), reading module files for functions and version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Import statements load internal functions and version; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; no dynamic execution or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; only static imports and API exposure. Importing private functions (_core_computation, _bias_correction) is standard for internal modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup for a Python package, importing internal functions and defining __all__ for exports. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The functions imported are likely internal helpers related to forest confidence intervals, not malicious. The version import is standard. The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or dynamic execution. The import of private functions does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is 0, with high confidence. The code is straightforward and typical for package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
