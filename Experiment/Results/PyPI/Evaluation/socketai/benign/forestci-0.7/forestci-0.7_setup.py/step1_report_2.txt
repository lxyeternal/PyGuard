{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, primarily to specify dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements.txt for dependencies, importing setuptools, numpy, scipy, and reading version.py for version info.",
  "targets": "No evident untrusted data handling; no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reading dependency list from requirements.txt -> defining setup options -> executing setup().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs. The warnings for missing numpy and scipy are standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules for package setup. It reads dependencies from a requirements file, checks for optional dependencies (numpy, scipy), and reads version info from a version.py file. The setup() function is called with collected options. All operations are typical for a setup script and do not involve untrusted data or malicious logic. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious code paths are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs package configuration tasks securely and transparently.",
