  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and installing the 'forestci' Python project, managing dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt', importing modules (numpy, scipy), opening 'forestci/version.py', and reading package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "exec() call executing the contents of 'forestci/version.py', which may define variables, but does not inherently execute malicious code unless the file is malicious.",
  "flows": "Reading 'requirements.txt' -> warning if modules missing -> executing 'version.py' -> setup() with collected options.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on an external file 'version.py'. While common in setup scripts, it can be malicious if the file is tampered with. No other suspicious activity or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and issues warnings if 'numpy' or 'scipy' are missing. It dynamically executes 'version.py' to retrieve version info, which is a common pattern but could be risky if 'version.py' is compromised. The setup() function uses collected package info to build distribution metadata. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident aside from the exec() call. The rest of the code is standard setup script structure.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup.py script with standard practices. The only potential concern is the use of exec() on an external file, which could be exploited if 'version.py' is maliciously modified. Otherwise, no malicious behavior detected.",
