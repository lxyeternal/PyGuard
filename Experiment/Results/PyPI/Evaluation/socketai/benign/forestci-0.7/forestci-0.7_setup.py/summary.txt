  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent. The primary concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which could be exploited if 'version.py' is maliciously altered. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present. The current scores are appropriate, with malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a low to moderate security risk score due to exec() usage. To improve security, replacing exec() with safer import mechanisms is recommended. Overall, the script is safe in typical environments, but caution should be exercised regarding the version file integrity."
