  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, specifying dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt', reads 'forestci/version.py', imports modules (setuptools, sys, os, warnings, numpy, scipy).",
  "sinks": "exec() call executing content of 'forestci/version.py' (potentially malicious code), warnings.warn() functions, importing external modules.",
  "flows": "Reads requirements from file -> executes version.py content -> warns if modules missing -> calls setup() with options.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run contents of 'forestci/version.py' which could contain malicious code, reliance on external requirements files, no validation of 'version.py' content.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py for packaging a Python project. It reads dependencies from a file and executes a version file. The use of exec() on 'forestci/version.py' poses a potential security risk if the version file is compromised, as it could execute malicious code. However, in normal operations, this is a common pattern to extract variables. No other suspicious behavior such as network connections, hidden backdoors, or data leaks is present. The rest of the code is standard packaging logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a potential risk associated with the exec() function used to load version information. There are no clear indicators of malicious intent, but the exec() call warrants caution if the version.py file is untrusted or compromised.",
