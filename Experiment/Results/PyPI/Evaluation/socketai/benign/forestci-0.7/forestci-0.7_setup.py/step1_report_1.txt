  "purpose": "This script is used for packaging and distribution of a Python project, managing dependencies, and setting package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies; reads 'forestci/version.py' for version info; imports standard libraries and third-party packages.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data could cause security issues; mainly reads files and imports modules.",
  "flows": "Reads dependencies and version info from files; executes version.py; passes collected data to setuptools.setup() to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs typical setup tasks without unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code reads dependency requirements from a text file and version information from a Python file. It imports standard modules and third-party libraries, issuing warnings if some are missing. The setup configuration is assembled with collected metadata. No suspicious behavior, hidden code, or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be standard packaging boilerplate for Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It reads files for dependencies and version info, then calls setup() with the collected data. No suspicious or malicious activities are present.",
