  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, dynamic code execution, network communication, environment variables, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, data exfiltration points, system modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as code input or environment variables flow into processing functions, which may then connect to network sinks or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Inconsistent obfuscation scores relative to described complexity; presence of dynamic code features; missing or empty code in some reports; high obfuscation scores without corresponding malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate benign code with no concrete malicious activity. Report 3 notes obfuscation with a high score (0.7), justified by obfuscated patterns. Report 2 mentions complex logic and dynamic features but assigns obfuscation score 0, which is inconsistent; recommended to increase to 0.5. Other reports are consistent with low malware and obfuscation scores. Confidence levels are moderate to high, reflecting cautious analysis. Overall, no evidence of malicious behavior or high security risk is found, but some obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malware. Obfuscation varies but is not indicative of malicious intent. Security risk remains low. Adjustments to report 2's obfuscation score improve consistency. Final scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0.5, risk=0.2.",
