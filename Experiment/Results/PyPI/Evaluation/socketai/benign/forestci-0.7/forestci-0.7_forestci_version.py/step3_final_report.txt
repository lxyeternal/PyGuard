{
  "purpose": "This code defines static package metadata including versioning, description, author, and classifiers for a Python package, intended for use in setup scripts.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded variables for version components, static string assignments for metadata and descriptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Static data assignment and string concatenation; no dynamic or external data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and adheres to standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a version string from predefined variables, assigns package metadata, and defines descriptive strings. It contains no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity. The structure is typical for Python setup scripts, with all data hardcoded. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package metadata script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its static and safe nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
