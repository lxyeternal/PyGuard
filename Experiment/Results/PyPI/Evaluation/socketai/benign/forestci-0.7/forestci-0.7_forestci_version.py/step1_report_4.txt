  "purpose": "Define version, metadata, and description information for the Python package 'forestci'.",
  "sources": "Constants and string concatenation operations for version and description variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no input/output or external data processing that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly static metadata assembly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely sets package metadata, version strings, and descriptive variables with static values. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used. No external network connections, command executions, or file manipulations are present. The version string construction is straightforward, and all information is hardcoded. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package metadata definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, and the likelihood of malicious activity is extremely low.",
