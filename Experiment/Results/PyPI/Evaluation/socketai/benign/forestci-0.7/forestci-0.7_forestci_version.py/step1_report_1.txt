  "purpose": "Define version information and metadata for the Python package 'forestci'.",
  "sources": "Constant variable assignments, string concatenations, and list definitions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes to external systems or handles untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows or external data processing. Version components are hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or hardcoded secrets are present. No obfuscated or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static variable definitions for package versioning, package metadata, and descriptive strings. It constructs a version string from predefined variables, which are all hardcoded. The metadata includes URLs, contact info, and descriptive text. No external input handling, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard setup/metadata code for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, straightforward package information setup.",
