{
  "purpose": "Define version information and metadata for the 'forestci' Python package, including descriptions, classifiers, and author details.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version numbers, package metadata, description strings, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external inputs/output outside static definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A; all data are static and initialized within the script.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static variable assignments defining version info, package metadata, and descriptive strings for the package. It constructs a version string dynamically but only from predefined variables. No external input handling, no use of eval or exec, and no network operations. The structure follows standard setup.py or configuration script patterns for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard package metadata script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only defines static package information and does not perform any potentially harmful operations.",
