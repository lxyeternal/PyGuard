  "purpose": "Define package version, metadata, and descriptions for the 'forestci' Python package.",
  "sources": "Version components, package metadata variables, description strings",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sources or sensitive sinks present",
  "flows": "Assignment of version strings and metadata, concatenation of description strings",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No obfuscation, no malicious functions, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs package metadata, including version string assembly and descriptive variables. The version is assembled from separate components, and description strings are concatenated for package info. There are no input sources of untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, network calls, or other suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a standard setup/configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package metadata setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
