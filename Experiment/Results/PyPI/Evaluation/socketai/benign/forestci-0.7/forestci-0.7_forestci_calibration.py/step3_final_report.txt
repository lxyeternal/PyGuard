  "malware": 0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "purpose": "Implements empirical Bayes estimation for variance calibration, including prior fitting, posterior estimation, and calibration routines.",
  "sources": "Input arrays 'X' (observations), 'variances' (variance estimates), and parameters for statistical modeling.",
  "sinks": "No external system calls, network activity, or file I/O; computations are self-contained within numpy and scipy libraries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through prior fitting ('gfit'), posterior estimation ('gbayes'), and calibration ('calibrateEB'), with no external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external system interactions detected; numerical warnings are standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard statistical procedures for empirical Bayes estimation using well-established libraries. It includes assertions and warnings for numerical stability, but no malicious or suspicious behavior. The absence of external communication, obfuscation, or malicious payloads indicates a legitimate implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a transparent, standard implementation of empirical Bayes methods for variance calibration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor security risk score reflects typical numerical stability considerations, not actual security threats.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
