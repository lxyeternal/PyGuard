{
  "purpose": "Calculate confidence intervals and variance estimates for scikit-learn RandomForestRegressor and RandomForestClassifier predictions using established statistical methods.",
  "sources": "Model attributes (e.g., estimators_, n_estimators), input data (X_test), inbag matrices, and internal functions for sampling and predictions.",
  "sinks": "Internal numerical computations; no external data transmission, network activity, or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model attributes and input data through numpy operations and internal functions to produce variance and confidence interval estimates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements statistical variance estimation techniques based on published research, relying solely on standard libraries (numpy, scikit-learn). It processes model attributes and input data internally, with no external communication or system modifications. The use of deep copies for calibration and internal data handling are standard practices. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of confidence interval calculations for Random Forest models, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
