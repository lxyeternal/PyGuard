{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package distribution for 'aws-cdk-lib' by loading metadata from a JSON string, reading a README file for long description, and invoking setuptools.setup() with these parameters.",
  "sources": "Data sources include a hardcoded JSON string containing package metadata, and a README.md file read for long_description.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call is the sink where package metadata is passed, but no untrusted data is used here; the JSON is hardcoded and the README is read locally.",
  "flows": "The JSON string is parsed and its content is passed to setup(), and the README content flows into 'long_description' parameter; no external or untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code primarily performs static configuration for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package metadata from a static JSON string, reads a local README file, and passes these to setuptools.setup() for package distribution. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. All data is static and used in the expected manner for package setup. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with static data and no signs of malicious behavior. It appears safe and intended solely for package distribution purposes.",
