{
  "purpose": "This code loads package metadata from a static JSON string, reads a README.md file for the long description, and invokes setuptools.setup() to configure the package.",
  "sources": "Static JSON string containing package metadata and local README.md file.",
  "sinks": "Data passed directly to setuptools.setup() without external untrusted input influencing behavior.",
  "flows": "Static JSON data and README content flow into setup() as parameters for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It loads metadata from a static JSON string, reads a local README.md file, and calls setuptools.setup() with this data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external untrusted data influencing the process. The process is straightforward and typical for package distribution. The scores assigned in the initial reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns. It poses no security risks and is safe for distribution.",
