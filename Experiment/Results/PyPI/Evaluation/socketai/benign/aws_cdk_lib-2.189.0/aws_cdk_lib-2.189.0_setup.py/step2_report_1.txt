  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard package setup; metadata loaded from JSON, README read for description.\n- Sources & Flows: Static JSON string and local README; data passed directly to setup().\n- Anomalies: None detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: The process is typical for Python packaging. No suspicious activity or malware. The confidence is high (1), and all scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, standard setup.\n- Sources & Flows: Static JSON and local README; no untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Same as above, standard, safe, and no malicious intent. Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Again, a typical setup script for a large package.\n- Sources & Flows: Static JSON and local README; no external untrusted input.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Standard package configuration, no malicious behavior. Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Standard package setup.\n- Sources & Flows: Static JSON and local README; no untrusted data flow.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: No suspicious activity; safe and typical for package distribution. Scores are justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, standard setup.\n- Sources & Flows: Static data, no external untrusted input.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Safe, standard, with no malicious intent. Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is accurate given the static, straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0.0, justified because there are no vulnerabilities, no dynamic code, no network activity, and no malicious behaviors.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a typical, static setup script for a Python package.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall:** The code is benign, standard, and safe for distribution.",
