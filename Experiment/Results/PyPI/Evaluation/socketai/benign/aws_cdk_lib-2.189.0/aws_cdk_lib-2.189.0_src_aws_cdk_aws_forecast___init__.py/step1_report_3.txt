{
  "purpose": "Defines AWS CloudFormation resources for Amazon Forecast datasets and dataset groups using AWS CDK constructs.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (jsii, publication, typeguard, constructs, etc.), and class definitions with methods and properties that generate CloudFormation resource specifications.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted input or perform network operations. No code injection, data leakage, or insecure operations detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to resource property definitions, which are used to generate CloudFormation templates; no untrusted data flows to external systems or insecure endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are evident. The code primarily defines data structures and resource properties with no suspicious dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of AWS CDK constructs for AWS Forecast resources, including class definitions for datasets and dataset groups, along with associated property classes and property validation stubs. There is no evidence of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be auto-generated or boilerplate for defining AWS resources in a cloud infrastructure. The presence of type checking stubs and structured data types aligns with best practices but does not introduce security risks. The imported modules are common for CDK and type safety enforcement, and no network or data-exfiltration behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical infrastructure-as-code resource definition for AWS CDK, with no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities. It serves its purpose of defining resources for AWS Forecast and includes no suspicious operations.",
