{
  "purpose": "This code defines AWS CloudFormation resource classes for AWS Forecast datasets and dataset groups, including their properties and associated data types, to be used within AWS CDK applications.",
  "sources": "The code sources include module imports, class constructors, property getters/setters, data type definitions, and type checking functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the property assignments and jsii.create calls that instantiate resource objects with provided properties.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters (inputs) into property initializations and jsii object creation; property setters also accept external values, but there are no unsafe or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code strictly defines resource schemas and type checks. The type checking functions are placeholders without implementation, which is normal for stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely infrastructural, defining resource classes and data structures for AWS CDK. There are no network operations, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic. The functions serve to enforce types and facilitate resource instantiation. All data flows are predictable and controlled, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard AWS CDK resource class definitions for Forecast datasets and dataset groups. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code’s purpose is to enable infrastructure as code deployment, with no evidence of supply chain attacks or malware.",
