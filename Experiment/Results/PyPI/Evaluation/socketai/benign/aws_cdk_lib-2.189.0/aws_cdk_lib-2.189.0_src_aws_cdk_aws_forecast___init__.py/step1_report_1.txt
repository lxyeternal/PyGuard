{
  "purpose": "This code defines CloudFormation resource classes and data structures for AWS Forecast datasets and dataset groups within the AWS CDK library, enabling infrastructure as code deployment.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external or untrusted input; it primarily defines classes, properties, and data structures used for resource configuration.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that perform network operations, file writes, or system modifications; all actions are confined to defining resource configurations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code establishes class structures and property setters/getters for resource attributes.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic; it follows standard patterns for AWS CDK resource definitions. No obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines resource classes and data types for AWS CloudFormation templates in the AWS CDK context. It includes type hints, validation functions, and class properties for resource attributes. No network calls, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The structure and content align with standard AWS CDK library design, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate part of the AWS CDK library for AWS Forecast resources. It contains no malware or security risks, and its purpose is to facilitate infrastructure provisioning. There are no indications of malicious intent or supply chain attacks.",
