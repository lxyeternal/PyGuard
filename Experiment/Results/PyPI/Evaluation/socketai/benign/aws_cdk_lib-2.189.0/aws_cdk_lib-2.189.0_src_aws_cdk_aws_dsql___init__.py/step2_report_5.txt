  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code to identify any discrepancies, potential issues, or inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as defining an AWS CDK resource for `AWS::DSQL::Cluster`.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is standard, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the code's nature. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the code as a resource class with typical patterns, including jsii interactions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no signs of malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, standard resource class with property validation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious elements detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, standard class definition, use of jsii, typeguard, and resource attributes.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as previous, standard CDK resource class.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is a typical AWS CDK resource class, auto-generated or boilerplate, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or external network activity.\n- **Logic & Reasoning Flaws:** None identified; the reports are consistent with the code's structure.\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Potential Risks & Assumptions:** No assumptions are made about external inputs or network activity; the code is purely declarative resource modeling.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured AWS CDK resource class for `AWS::DSQL::Cluster`. It contains no malicious logic, obfuscation, or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis assessment aligns with all provided reports and the code analysis.",
