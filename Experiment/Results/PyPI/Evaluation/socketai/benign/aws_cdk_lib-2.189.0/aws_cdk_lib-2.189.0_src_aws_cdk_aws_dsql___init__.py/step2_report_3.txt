  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any suspicious or malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard AWS CDK resource class for AWS::DSQL::Cluster, with no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or external data leaks.\n- **Findings:** The report correctly identifies that the code involves class definitions, property setters/getters, and type checks. No external network calls, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  These are appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign and typical for CDK constructs.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it confirms the code is a legitimate AWS CDK resource class with standard patterns, no malicious activity, and proper type validation.\n- **Findings:** The use of jsii, typeguard, and resource attribute accessors are standard. No external network activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  These are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe and typical.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a standard resource class for AWS::DSQL::Cluster with no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The code is typical SDK/library code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard resource class with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No external data leaks, network calls, or suspicious code. Use of jsii and typeguard is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is legitimate and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical AWS CDK resource class, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No external input handling or network activity. The code is primarily class definitions and property management.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, generated AWS CDK resource class with no malicious or suspicious behaviors.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n- The code contains no external network calls, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious logic.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThe code is a typical, safe resource class definition for AWS CDK, with no signs of security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Given the comprehensive analysis and consistent findings across all reports, I concur with the current scores and assessments. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is benign and should be considered safe.",
