  "purpose": "Define AWS CloudFormation resource for AWS::DSQL::Cluster within AWS CDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class constructors, property definitions, type checking functions, and resource attribute accessors.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external network calls, or sensitive data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (props, parameters) flow through constructors and property setters; no external or untrusted data flow to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code is standard CDK resource class implementation with type checks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard AWS CDK construct class implementation for AWS::DSQL::Cluster, including resource property definitions, attribute accessors, and type checking stubs. No external input, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are evident. No obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious logic present. Functions primarily perform type assertions and resource attribute retrievals, consistent with typical CDK constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured AWS CDK resource class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It strictly defines cloud infrastructure resources without any malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
