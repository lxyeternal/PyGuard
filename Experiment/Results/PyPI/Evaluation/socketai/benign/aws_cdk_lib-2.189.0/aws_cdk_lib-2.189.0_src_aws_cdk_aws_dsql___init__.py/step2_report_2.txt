  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard AWS CDK resource class for AWS::DSQL::Cluster, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The report confirms that no external network calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0; risk score is 0. This aligns with the findings.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a typical CDK resource class with standard patterns, type checks, and no suspicious behaviors. No external calls or malicious code detected.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0; risk score is 0. Consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a standard resource class with type validation, attribute accessors, and no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0; risk score is 0. Correct.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—standard resource class, no external network activity, no malicious logic.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0; risk 0. Correct.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports—standard resource class, no suspicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0; risk 0. Correct.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code presence:** The code is a typical AWS CDK construct for a CloudFormation resource (`AWS::DSQL::Cluster`).\n- **Malware:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, obfuscated logic, or suspicious external calls.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward and auto-generated.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Scores consistency:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured AWS CDK resource class with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified.\n\n**Note:** Always consider that auto-generated SDK/library code for resource modeling is unlikely to contain malicious content. The focus should be on external data flows or dynamic behaviors, which are absent here.",
