{
  "purpose": "Defines a CloudFormation resource class for AWS DSQL Cluster within the AWS CDK library, including properties and type checks.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules and libraries, class constructor, property getters/setters, and type checking stub functions.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No untrusted input handling or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Imports and class constructor initialize properties; property setters and getters access or modify class attributes. No external data flow or execution of untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CloudFormation resource class with standard AWS CDK patterns, including property validation, attribute access, and resource type declarations. The typechecking functions are straightforward, and no dynamic code execution or external input handling is present. The code appears to be standard SDK/library code for resource modeling, with no malicious behavior or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of a CloudFormation resource class for AWS DSQL Cluster. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It functions solely as part of the AWS CDK infrastructure-as-code framework.",
