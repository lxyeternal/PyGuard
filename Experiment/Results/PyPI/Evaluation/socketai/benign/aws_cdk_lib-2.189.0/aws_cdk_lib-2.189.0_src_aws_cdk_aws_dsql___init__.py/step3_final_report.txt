{
  "purpose": "Defines an AWS CloudFormation resource class for AWS::DSQL::Cluster within the AWS CDK, providing property accessors, attribute getters, and resource registration logic.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, property setters, attribute accessors, and internal type validation functions.",
  "sinks": "No external network calls, data leaks, or untrusted data sinks are present; data flows are limited to class properties and constructor inputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class properties; attribute getters retrieve resource attributes; no external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code follows standard CDK resource class structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical auto-generated AWS CDK resource class for AWS::DSQL::Cluster, utilizing jsii for cross-language support and typeguard for runtime type validation. It contains property definitions, attribute accessors, and resource registration logic. No external network activity, malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is well-structured, clear, and adheres to standard patterns for resource modeling. The type validation functions serve to ensure input correctness without introducing security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard AWS CDK resource class with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent; the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is 0, reflecting the safe and straightforward nature of the code.",
