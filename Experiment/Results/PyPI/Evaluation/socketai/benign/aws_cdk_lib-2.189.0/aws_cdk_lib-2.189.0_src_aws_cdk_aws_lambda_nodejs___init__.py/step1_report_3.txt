{
  "purpose": "Defines data types, enums, and a class for configuring Node.js Lambda functions with esbuild bundling options within AWS CDK.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and metadata, class and enum definitions, and function definitions for type checking.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or data. No functions execute external commands or handle external untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The code is primarily declarative and type-safe definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code consists of class definitions, enums, and type checks.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structure and configuration for AWS Lambda functions using CDK. It includes data classes, enums for bundling options, log levels, output formats, and source map modes. All functions are type check stubs, and there are no runtime behaviors, external command executions, or data processing. The content is consistent with standard CDK library code for AWS Lambda Node.js functions. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or sabotage. It is a purely declarative configuration setup for CDK constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured AWS CDK library code for configuring Node.js Lambda functions with esbuild. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code serves as configuration schemas and class definitions, with no runtime data handling or external interactions.",
