  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and determine the appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** The report correctly identifies that the code defines AWS CDK constructs for S3 Object Lambda access points and their policies. It notes the absence of dynamic or external data flows, backdoors, or malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is mainly boilerplate, generated resource definitions, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: **0** (no malicious activity) — **appropriate**  \n  - Obfuscated: **0** (no obfuscation detected) — **appropriate**  \n  - Risk: **0** (no security risk) — **appropriate**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code models AWS resources without external or untrusted data flows. It highlights the standard nature of the code, with no malicious signs.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code is purely declarative resource modeling.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: **0** — **appropriate**  \n  - Obfuscated: **0** — **appropriate**  \n  - Risk: **0** — **appropriate**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Reiterates that the code is resource class definitions for AWS CDK, with no external data handling or suspicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no external communication.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: **0** — **appropriate**  \n  - Obfuscated: **0** — **appropriate**  \n  - Risk: **0** — **appropriate**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Same conclusion: standard resource definitions, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** Clear, safe, and typical CDK resource code.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: **0** — **appropriate**  \n  - Obfuscated: **0** — **appropriate**  \n  - Risk: **0** — **appropriate**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Consistent with previous assessments; no signs of malicious behavior, external data leaks, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, auto-generated resource modeling code.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: **0** — **appropriate**  \n  - Obfuscated: **0** — **appropriate**  \n  - Risk: **0** — **appropriate**\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports and code indicate no malicious activity, network calls, or code injection. The code is purely declarative resource definitions for AWS CDK.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation or code hiding techniques are present. The code is straightforward and readable.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is just resource modeling with no runtime logic, external data processing, or secrets, the overall security risk is minimal.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0** (or at most 0.1 for minor configuration complexity, but given the assessments, 0 is justified)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The provided code and reports are consistent, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity. The scores should remain at zero across all categories, reflecting a benign, standard infrastructure-as-code resource definition module.",
