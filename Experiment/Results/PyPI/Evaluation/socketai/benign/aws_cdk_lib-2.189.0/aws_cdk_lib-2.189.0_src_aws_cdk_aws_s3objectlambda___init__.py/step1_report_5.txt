{
  "purpose": "This code defines AWS CloudFormation constructs and properties for managing S3 Object Lambda access points and policies using the AWS CDK library.",
  "sources": "Reads input from parameters in constructors, property setters, and type hint checks; no direct external data input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident that process untrusted data for execution or data exfiltration; no network calls, command executions, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters and property assignments into internal property storage and then into AWS CloudFormation resource creation via jsii. No untrusted data is used in sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code follows typical AWS CDK pattern for resource definitions, with standard type checking and property validation. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured set of AWS CDK resource classes for S3 Object Lambda access points and policies. It includes property definitions, data types, and jsii integration for AWS CloudFormation resource representation. The type checks and property setters ensure type safety, but do not introduce any malicious behavior. No network activity, command execution, or hidden data leaks are observed. The code appears to be auto-generated or template-like, focusing on resource modeling without any hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of AWS CDK constructs for S3 Object Lambda resources, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe to use from a supply chain security perspective.",
