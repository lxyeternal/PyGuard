  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's structure, behavior, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** The report states that the code defines AWS CDK constructs for S3 Object Lambda access points and policies, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is primarily boilerplate, auto-generated resource definitions, with type checking and property setters. No network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious logic are present.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Confidence:** High (1).\n\n**Assessment:** The code appears safe, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code models AWS resources without external data flows or malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical resource modeling library, with no signs of sabotage or malware.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0.\n- **Confidence:** High (1).\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious intent or behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Same as above, focusing on resource definitions and property validation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Confidence:** High (1).\n\n**Assessment:** Safe, standard resource code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Again, resource classes and data structures for AWS CDK.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity, code injection, or external communication.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Confidence:** High (1).\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Same pattern—resource definitions, type checks, property setters.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No external data handling, network calls, or malicious logic.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Confidence:** High (1).\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a standard, safe resource modeling library.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is standard resource definition code for AWS CDK, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score Justification:** The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the absence of any malicious activity, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms.\n- **Obfuscated Score Justification:** The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear, structured, and generated from known patterns.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** The risk score is 0 or very close to it, as the code is purely declarative resource configuration with no runtime logic that could be exploited.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risk from malicious intent.\n\n**Overall, the supply chain security assessment indicates this code is safe, standard, and free of malicious behavior.**",
