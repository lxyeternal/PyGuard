  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Describes resource classes and properties for AWS S3 Object Lambda Access Points, with no external or runtime code execution.\n- **Analysis:** The code is boilerplate, generated, and purely declarative. No network calls, no code injection, no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** The report assigns malware = 0, security risk = 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Confidence:** High (1).\n\n**Verdict:** The code is safe, standard resource modeling code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar resource definitions, focusing on resource input parameters and property exposure.\n- **Analysis:** No untrusted data flow, no external communication, no obfuscation. The code is typical for infrastructure as code.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.1 (very low).\n- **Confidence:** High (1).\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity, just resource definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Same pattern—resource classes, data classes, validation stubs.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; purely declarative, with standard patterns.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** High (1).\n\n**Verdict:** Safe, standard AWS CDK resource code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Defines resource classes, data types, and validation functions.\n- **Analysis:** No external data handling or malicious code; standard resource modeling.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** High (1).\n\n**Verdict:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar resource class definitions, property setters, validation.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no external code execution, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** High (1).\n\n**Verdict:** Clearly benign, standard resource modeling code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, generated, resource-defining module for AWS CDK. It contains no network calls, no code injection, no obfuscated code, and no malicious logic.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Scores are consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, as the code is purely declarative and does not perform runtime operations beyond resource instantiation.\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risk beyond the inherent risks of misconfigured resources, which are outside the scope of static code review here.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, generated AWS CDK resource module for S3 Object Lambda access points. It shows no signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated, with a minimal security risk score reflecting the nature of infrastructure code.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed review of specific parts or further analysis.",
