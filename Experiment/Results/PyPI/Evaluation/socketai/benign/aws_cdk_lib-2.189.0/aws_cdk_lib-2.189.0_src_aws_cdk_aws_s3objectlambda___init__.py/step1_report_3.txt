{
  "purpose": "The code defines AWS CloudFormation resource classes and data structures for managing AWS S3 Object Lambda access points and policies within AWS CDK, facilitating infrastructure as code deployment.",
  "sources": "Data input occurs through constructor parameters for resource creation and property setters. No external untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Resource attributes and properties are used internally and for CloudFormation template rendering; no direct output or external communication mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor arguments into resource properties and then to CloudFormation resource definitions; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks such as network or file system operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains typical resource class definitions, type checking, and structural data classes. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present. No obfuscation or hidden code segments are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured as standard AWS CDK resource and property class definitions, including type hints, validation, and jsii integration for multi-language support. All methods and data types conform to expected patterns for infrastructure code. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code strictly models AWS resources and does not perform any runtime operations beyond resource instantiation and validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation of AWS CDK constructs for S3 Object Lambda resources. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. Its purpose is to facilitate infrastructure deployment with no evident security concerns.",
