{
  "purpose": "Defines AWS CloudFormation resource constructs for S3 Object Lambda Access Points and associated policies in the AWS CDK framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, internal jsii, and CDK constructs; class constructors and property setters that receive configuration data; no external input handling or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "Resource creation via jsii, property accessors for resource attributes, and validation functions; no data leaks, network calls, or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Class constructors and property setters pass configuration data to jsii for resource instantiation; no untrusted data flows to external systems or network endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, secrets, or sensitive data; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; code strictly defines data structures and resource properties without runtime code execution or external data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines data classes, resource constructs, and validation stubs for AWS CDK resource representation. It uses standard patterns for resource properties, attribute access, and type checking. No indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or backdoors. The functions for type checking are typical for development environments and do not perform any runtime malicious operations. No external input or user-supplied data is processed at runtime. The resource instantiation and property validation are standard CDK patterns, with no signs of sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign resource definition module for AWS CDK constructs related to S3 Object Lambda access points and policies. It does not contain any malicious code or behavior, nor does it exhibit signs of obfuscation or sabotage. It is a safe, standard implementation of AWS resource constructs.",
