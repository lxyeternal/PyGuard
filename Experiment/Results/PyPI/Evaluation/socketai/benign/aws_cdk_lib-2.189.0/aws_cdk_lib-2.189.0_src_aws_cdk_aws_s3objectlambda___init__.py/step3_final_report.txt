{
  "purpose": "The code defines AWS CDK resource classes and data structures for S3 Object Lambda access points and their policies, primarily serving as boilerplate resource modeling without runtime logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters for resource properties and configuration objects; no external or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data sinks, network calls, or data exfiltration points; the code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into resource constructors and property setters; no malicious or suspicious data flows are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present; the code follows standard resource class patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of generated resource classes with type checking and property validation, serving as infrastructure definitions. No network activity, code injection, or malicious logic is evident. The code is straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or obfuscation. All signals indicate a benign, standard resource modeling module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard AWS CDK resource module for S3 Object Lambda access points. It shows no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
