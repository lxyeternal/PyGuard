{
  "purpose": "Defines AWS CloudFormation resource classes for AWS Rekognition services such as Collection, Project, and Stream Processor within AWS CDK, providing constructs to manage Rekognition resources programmatically.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (jsii, publication, constructs, typeguard, importlib.metadata), class initializers, property getters/setters, and data class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks like network calls, file writes, or system commands. Data flows are confined to attribute assignments and property accessors within the class definitions.",
  "flows": "Data flows primarily through class constructors, property getters/setters, and internal attribute dictionaries; no untrusted data sources or malicious sink operations identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior. All code appears to be standard SDK resource definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of class definitions for AWS Rekognition CloudFormation resources, using jsii for inter-language operability. It includes property validation via typeguard, structured data classes for resource properties, and resource attributes. No network or file operations, no code injection points, and no signs of malicious behavior. The code appears to be standard SDK-generated resource modeling code for AWS CDK, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, well-structured, resource definition library for AWS CDK for Rekognition. It contains no malicious behavior, sabotage, or suspicious operations. The code primarily consists of class and property definitions for resource modeling, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
