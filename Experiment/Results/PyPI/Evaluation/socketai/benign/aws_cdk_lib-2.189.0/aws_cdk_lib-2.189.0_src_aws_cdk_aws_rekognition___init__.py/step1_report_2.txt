{
  "purpose": "Define AWS CloudFormation resources and properties for AWS Rekognition services such as Collection, Project, and Stream Processor within the AWS CDK framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, jsii, publication, constructs, and AWS CDK modules; class constructors; property setters/getters; data type definitions; type checking functions.",
  "sinks": "None observed that directly handle untrusted user input or network operations; class constructors mainly assign properties; no code injection or external data handling detected.",
  "flows": "Class constructors create resource objects; properties set or retrieve resource attributes; type checking functions validate input types; no data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of extensive, complex resource class definitions with detailed type checking functions; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of resource class definitions for AWS CDK constructs, including property validation and resource attribute accessors. The type checking functions support static validation but do not perform any malicious operations. There are no network calls, no code injection mechanisms, or data exfiltration logic. The overall structure is consistent with SDK resource definitions and appears safe. The complexity and size of the code are typical for infrastructure resource modeling and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of AWS CDK constructs for Rekognition resources with thorough type validation and attribute accessors. No signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks are present. It appears safe and legitimate, designed for infrastructure as code deployment.",
