  "purpose": "The code defines AWS MediaConvert resource classes for infrastructure provisioning using AWS CDK, including resource properties, data types, and resource attribute accessors.",
  "sources": "Static class definitions, property setters/getters, type validation functions, and resource attribute accessors; no external input or runtime data processing.",
  "sinks": "No network communication, data exfiltration, or external data handling; purely declarative resource configuration.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from class properties into resource definitions; no dynamic or external data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a boilerplate, generated SDK for AWS CDK resources related to MediaConvert. It contains no runtime logic, network activity, or external data handling. The type checks and class structures are standard for infrastructure-as-code libraries, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This supply chain component appears benign and secure. It is a standard, static resource definition library with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
