  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious or suspicious behavior:**  \n   - The code is a standard set of AWS CDK resource class definitions for MediaConvert (JobTemplate, Preset, Queue).  \n   - It contains constructors, property getters/setters, type-checking functions, and data classes for resource properties.  \n   - No network activity, external data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.  \n   - The functions are mainly for static type validation and resource configuration, typical for SDK or infrastructure-as-code libraries.\n\n2. **Code integrity and logic:**  \n   - The code is consistent with AWS CDK patterns, using jsii for language interoperability, and standard class structures.  \n   - No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident.  \n   - The \"check_type\" functions are for static type safety, not runtime security risks.  \n   - The data flows are purely configuration data into resource definitions; no untrusted data sources or external communications are involved.\n\n3. **Scores justification:**  \n   - **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, generated boilerplate, no obfuscation.  \n   - **Risk score:** 0 — the code is for infrastructure resource definitions, not runtime code executing untrusted actions.\n\n4. **Errors or logical flaws in the report:**  \n   - The reports are consistent with the code. They correctly identify that the code is standard resource class definitions with no malicious behavior.  \n   - No unreasonable score adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a typical, boilerplate AWS CDK resource library for MediaConvert, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The data flows are safe, and the purpose is purely declarative infrastructure configuration.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the absence of any security concern based on the provided code and reports.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure to verify the actual runtime environment and dependencies for supply chain risks, but based solely on this static code review, the code appears safe.",
