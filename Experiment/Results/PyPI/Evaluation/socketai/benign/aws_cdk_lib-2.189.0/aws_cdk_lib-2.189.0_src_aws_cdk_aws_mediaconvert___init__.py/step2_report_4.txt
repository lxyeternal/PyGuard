  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the appropriate security scores based on the provided code and the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1: \"Empty response\"**  \n- No content to analyze.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues, no risk.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 2: Purpose and Analysis**  \n- Purpose: Defines AWS MediaConvert resources for infrastructure management.  \n- Sources: Reads configuration data, no external or untrusted input.  \n- Sinks: No data exfiltration or network activity.  \n- Flows: Static configuration, no runtime external data processing.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.  \n- Analysis: Standard generated SDK code, with type checks and resource definitions.  \n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is boilerplate for AWS CDK constructs, with no signs of malicious intent.  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Risk score: **0** (low, since no vulnerabilities or malicious activity are present)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3: \"Empty response\"**  \n- No content.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 4: Purpose and Analysis**  \n- Purpose: Similar to previous, defining AWS MediaConvert resources for IaC.  \n- Sources: No untrusted external input, only static class definitions and property setters.  \n- Sinks: No external communication or data leaks.  \n- Flows: Declarative resource definitions, no runtime external data processing.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.  \n- Analysis: Standard SDK/resource class code, with type validation and no malicious behavior.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, standard resource modeling code.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malicious activity or security risks.  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Risk score: **0**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5: Purpose and Analysis**  \n- Purpose: Same as above, defining resource classes for AWS MediaConvert via CDK.  \n- Sources: No untrusted input, static class and property definitions.  \n- Sinks: No external data leaks or network activity.  \n- Flows: Purely declarative, no runtime external data processing.  \n- Anomalies: No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code.  \n- Analysis: Typical SDK code for resource management, with type checks and no malicious patterns.  \n- Conclusion: No security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0**\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity; **0** across the board.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; **0**.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the code is standard SDK/resource definitions with no external communication, data exfiltration, or runtime malicious behavior, the overall security risk is negligible; **0**.\n\n### Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a typical open-source SDK fragment for AWS resource provisioning, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
