  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the appropriate scores based on the code content.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a set of AWS CDK construct classes and data types for AWS DevOps Guru resources.\n- It includes resource classes, property data types, and validation functions.\n- No network calls, file writes, or external data processing are present.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated, boilerplate, and standard for AWS SDK/library code.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### 1. **Presence of malicious code or backdoors**\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- No network or file I/O operations.\n- Functions are mainly type validation and resource class definitions.\n- No dynamic code execution or external communication.\n\n**Conclusion:** No malware or malicious behavior detected.\n\n#### 2. **Obfuscation or suspicious patterns**\n- The code is straightforward, with standard class definitions, property accessors, and type checks.\n- Use of `jsii`, `publication`, and `typeguard` suggests auto-generated SDK code.\n- No obfuscation, code hiding, or suspicious constructs.\n\n**Conclusion:** Not obfuscated; appears to be standard SDK code.\n\n#### 3. **Data flow and data handling**\n- No untrusted data sources.\n- No external data inputs or outputs.\n- Functions are static type check stubs and resource class definitions.\n\n**Conclusion:** No risky data flows.\n\n#### 4. **Purpose and context**\n- The purpose is to define AWS resource constructs for infrastructure as code.\n- No external inputs or user data processing.\n\n**Conclusion:** Safe, intended for resource provisioning.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring:\n\n| Aspect            | Score (0 to 1) | Justification |\n|-------------------|----------------|---------------|\n| **Malware**      | **0**          | No malicious code or behavior detected. |\n| **Obfuscated**   | **0**          | Code is straightforward, auto-generated SDK style. |\n| **Risk**         | **0**          | No security risks or vulnerabilities present. |\n\nThe confidence in these scores is high, given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- All reports agree on the benign, boilerplate nature of the code.\n- No external dependencies, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- The code is purely for resource modeling within AWS CDK.\n\n**Therefore, my overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, standard, and intended for infrastructure deployment, with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
