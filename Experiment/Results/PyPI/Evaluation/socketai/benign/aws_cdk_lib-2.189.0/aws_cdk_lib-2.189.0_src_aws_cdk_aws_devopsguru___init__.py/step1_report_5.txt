{
  "purpose": "Defines CloudFormation resource classes and properties for AWS DevOps Guru service integrations and resource collections within the AWS CDK framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules like 'pkgutil', 'abc', 'builtins', 'datetime', 'enum', 'typing', 'jsii', 'publication', 'typeguard', 'importlib.metadata', and internal CDK modules; use of jsii for resource class creation; type checking functions; class definitions for AWS CDK constructs.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sources, network calls, or external command executions are present. No dynamic code execution or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks are identified. The code primarily sets up class structures and properties for AWS resource definitions, with no active data handling or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code is standard for AWS CDK resource constructs. No backdoors or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class definitions and property structures for AWS DevOps Guru resources in the AWS CDK. It uses type hints, runtime type checks, and jsii integration for resource instantiation. The presence of type checking stubs and structured property classes suggests a focus on correctness and maintainability. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as network activity, data theft, or code obfuscation. The code is consistent with standard CDK resource module patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard implementation of AWS CDK resource classes for DevOps Guru, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves as infrastructure-as-code definitions without active external data handling or command execution. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
