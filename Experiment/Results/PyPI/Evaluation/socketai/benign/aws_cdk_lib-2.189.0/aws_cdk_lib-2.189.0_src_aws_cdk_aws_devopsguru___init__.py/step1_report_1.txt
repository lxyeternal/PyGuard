{
  "purpose": "The code defines AWS CloudFormation resource constructs for AWS DevOps Guru, including log anomaly detection integration, notification channels, and resource collections, intended for infrastructure as code deployment.",
  "sources": "Code imports modules such as 'jsii', 'publication', 'typeguard', and internal AWS CDK modules. No external user input or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present. The code does not perform network communication, file system modifications, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The code solely defines data structures and resource constructs without processing external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is primarily boilerplate for AWS resource definitions with proper typing and structural design. No obfuscation or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for AWS CDK constructs related to AWS DevOps Guru, including resource classes, property data types, and property validation. It uses standard patterns for AWS CDK resource creation, including type checks and property validation. There is no evidence of malicious code, external data processing, or dangerous behavior. The functions are mainly type stubs for static analysis. Overall, the code appears to be standard, well-structured infrastructure code for defining cloud resources.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a set of AWS CDK construct classes and data types for managing DevOps Guru resources. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious network or data leakage, nor any obfuscated or harmful logic. The code is safe and intended for infrastructure deployment purposes.",
