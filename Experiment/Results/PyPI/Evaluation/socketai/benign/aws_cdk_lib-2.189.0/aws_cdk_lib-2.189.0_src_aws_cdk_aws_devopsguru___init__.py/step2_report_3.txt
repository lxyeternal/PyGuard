  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Purpose**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a set of AWS CDK constructs for AWS DevOps Guru, including resource classes, properties, and validation functions.\n   - The code is primarily boilerplate, generated code, with no external input handling, network calls, or file operations.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious Indicators**:\n   - No external data sources, untrusted inputs, or network communication are present.\n   - No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious logic is detected.\n   - The functions are mainly type validation stubs and resource class definitions.\n\n3. **Data Flows & Sinks**:\n   - No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.\n   - No external command execution, network requests, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.\n   - The code is purely declarative, defining resource models.\n\n4. **Errors or Flaws**:\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The code adheres to standard patterns for AWS CDK resource definitions.\n   - The type checks and class structures are consistent and appropriate.\n\n5. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0, as the code is straightforward, generated boilerplate.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0.5 or lower, since the code is infrastructure code with no active data processing or external interactions.\n\n6. **Additional Observations**:\n   - The code is well-structured, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.\n   - The presence of type guard functions and data classes is typical for SDK or library code.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 (minimal, as it’s purely infrastructure code)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a standard, generated AWS CDK library module for AWS DevOps Guru resources. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no obfuscation. The risk is negligible, and the code is safe for deployment.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The supply chain security risk for this code is effectively nonexistent.\n- No further action needed.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown of any specific component or further analysis.",
