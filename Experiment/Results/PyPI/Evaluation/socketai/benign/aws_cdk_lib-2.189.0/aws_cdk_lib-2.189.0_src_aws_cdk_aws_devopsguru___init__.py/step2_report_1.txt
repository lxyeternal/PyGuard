  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the potential security implications, the correctness of the scoring, and the overall safety of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of the code:\n- The code is a set of AWS CDK constructs and data types for AWS DevOps Guru resources.\n- It uses standard libraries, jsii, publication, typeguard, and internal AWS CDK modules.\n- It defines resource classes, property data types, and validation functions.\n- No external input, network calls, or sensitive data handling are present.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated boilerplate for resource modeling.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### 1. **Presence of malicious code or backdoors**\n- No network communication, file system access, or external command execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- Functions are primarily type validation stubs and class definitions.\n- The import statements are from legitimate, well-known libraries.\n- No dynamic code evaluation, external data processing, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.**  \n**Score: malware = 0**\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Code obfuscation or suspicious constructs**\n- The code uses standard patterns for AWS CDK resource definitions.\n- Functions like `_typecheckingstub__...` are typical in generated SDK code for static analysis.\n- No code obfuscation, code hiding, or unusual language features.\n- The structure is clear, and the logic is straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Code is clean, well-structured, and not obfuscated.**  \n**Score: obfuscated = 0**\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Potential vulnerabilities or security risks**\n- No handling of untrusted data.\n- No external data inputs or outputs.\n- No secrets or sensitive data embedded.\n- The code is purely declarative, defining cloud resources.\n- No network activity or external API calls.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No security risks or vulnerabilities evident.**  \n**Score: risk = 0**\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Scores consistency and justification**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The detailed reasoning confirms the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The functions are type validation stubs, typical in SDKs, not malicious code.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nScores are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Aspect | Score | Justification |\n|---------|--------|----------------|\n| malware | 0 | No malicious code, network activity, or external data handling. |\n| obfuscated | 0 | Clear, standard, generated code without obfuscation. |\n| risk | 0 | No vulnerabilities, no untrusted data, no external communication. |\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, boilerplate AWS CDK resource library for AWS DevOps Guru. It is safe, well-structured, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n| Aspect | Score | Explanation |\n|---------|--------|--------------|\n| malware | 0 | No signs of malware. |\n| obfuscated | 0 | Clear, standard code, no obfuscation. |\n| risk | 0 | No vulnerabilities or security risks. |\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe reports' assessments are accurate. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\nThis code is safe and suitable for use in infrastructure as code deployments.",
