{
  "purpose": "Defines AWS CloudFormation resource classes and properties for AWS DevOps Guru service integration within the AWS CDK framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, jsii, publication, typeguard, and internal module _jsii; class initializers, property getters/setters, data types, and type check functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or external command executions are present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from input sources to sensitive sinks; data flows are limited to internal property and method access.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are evident. The code appears to be boilerplate and generated code for AWS resource definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of AWS CDK constructs for DevOps Guru resources. It includes class definitions with proper property management, type hints, and validation functions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious intent are present. The functions are straightforward, and all data appears to be for resource modeling, with no external or secret data handling. The presence of multiple property and data classes indicates structured resource definitions. The use of type guards and checks are consistent with safe, generated SDK code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate part of the AWS CDK library for DevOps Guru, serving as resource property definitions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. The code is standard, boilerplate, generated code, intended for resource modeling without any malicious intent.",
