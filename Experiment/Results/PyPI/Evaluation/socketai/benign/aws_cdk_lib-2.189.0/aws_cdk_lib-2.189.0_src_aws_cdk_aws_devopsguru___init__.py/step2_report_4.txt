  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines AWS DevOps Guru resources for infrastructure deployment.\n- **Sources & Flows:** No external input, network, or file operations; only class definitions and property management.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard boilerplate code for AWS CDK constructs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1 (due to high confidence, but the code is benign).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining resource classes and properties.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious activity, no external data handling, standard patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1 (again, high confidence in safety).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines resource constructs for AWS DevOps Guru, including resource collections and notification channels.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No external data, network activity, or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar resource definitions and property structures.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors, no external data flows.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Standard resource class definitions, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe code that is part of the AWS CDK library for DevOps Guru, primarily class definitions, property data types, and type validation functions.\n- **Behavior:** No network activity, no external data processing, no file I/O, no secret handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** The code is boilerplate for infrastructure as code, with no malicious intent or harmful behavior.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The high risk scores (1) seem to be based on the confidence that the code is well-structured but do not reflect actual malicious content.\n- Given the nature of the code, the risk score should be **close to 0**.\n- Malware and obfuscated scores are correctly at **0**.\n\n### Final estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to account for the potential of being part of a supply chain, but with no actual malicious content, this is minimal)\n\n**Summary:** The code is standard, generated resource definitions for AWS CDK, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe for use in infrastructure deployment.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1",
