  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard resource class for AWS LookoutVision Project.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses typical JSII calls (`jsii.create`, attribute access). Input parameters flow into resource creation.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard AWS CDK construct, with proper type checks, no malicious behavior, no external data leaks, or suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence & Scores:** High confidence (1), malware (0), obfuscated (0), risk (0.1) seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard patterns, type validation, and resource management.\n- No anomalies or malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** Consistent with a benign resource class, malware (0), obfuscated (0), risk (0.1).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the straightforward nature of the construct, no external or untrusted data processing.\n- No obfuscation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate, malware (0), obfuscated (0), risk (0).\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Highlights standard resource creation via JSII, no suspicious code.\n- No external communication or dynamic code execution.\n- **Scores:** Consistent, malware (0), obfuscated (0), risk (0).\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar conclusion: standard resource class, no malicious activity, no backdoors.\n- Inputs are configuration parameters only.\n- **Scores:** Appropriately zero malware, obfuscation, and very low risk.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Content & Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a standard AWS CDK construct for defining a LookoutVision project.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent across all reports.\n- **Risks:** Very low, consistent with infrastructure as code definitions.\n- **Supply Chain Concerns:** No evidence of tampering, malicious payloads, or suspicious external dependencies.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the consistent benign analysis, a score of **0.1** or **0** is appropriate; 0.1 is acceptable as a conservative measure for minor potential issues (e.g., misconfiguration risk), but it’s not indicative of a real threat.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or possibly 0 for maximum conservatism)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard AWS CDK resource class with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are consistent, and the resource functions as intended for infrastructure management. No security risks or malware concerns are present.",
