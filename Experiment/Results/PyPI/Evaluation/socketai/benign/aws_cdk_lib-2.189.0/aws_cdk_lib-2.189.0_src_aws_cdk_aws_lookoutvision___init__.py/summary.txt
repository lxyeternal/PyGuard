  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured AWS CDK resource class for managing a LookoutVision project. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low risk score are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
