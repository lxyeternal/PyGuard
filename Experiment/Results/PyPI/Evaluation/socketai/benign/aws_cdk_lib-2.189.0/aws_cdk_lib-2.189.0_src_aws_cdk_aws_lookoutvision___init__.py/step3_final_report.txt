{
  "purpose": "Defines an AWS CloudFormation resource class for AWS LookoutVision Project within AWS CDK, enabling infrastructure as code management.",
  "sources": "Resource property inputs such as 'project_name', and internal CDK constructs and JSII interactions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; resource attributes are accessed via standard getters; no external data flows or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into resource creation via constructor; attribute accessors retrieve resource attributes post-deployment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; standard CDK patterns used throughout.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical AWS CDK construct for defining a LookoutVision project, employing standard patterns like jsii, type checks, and property validation. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious backdoors are present. The type validation and resource property handling follow best practices. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign, infrastructural nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured AWS CDK resource class for managing a LookoutVision project. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low risk score are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
