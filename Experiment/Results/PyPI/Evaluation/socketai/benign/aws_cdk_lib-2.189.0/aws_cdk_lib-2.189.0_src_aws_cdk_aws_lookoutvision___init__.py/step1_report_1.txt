{
  "purpose": "Define AWS CloudFormation resource for AWS LookoutVision Project within AWS CDK framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters like 'scope', 'id', and 'project_name' during object instantiation; also uses metadata from import statements.",
  "sinks": "The code accesses class attributes such as 'attr_arn' and '_cfn_properties', and invokes methods like 'jsii.create' and 'jsii.invoke' which interact with underlying AWS CDK infrastructure.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through constructor and property setters to instantiate CloudFormation resource; attribute access retrieves resource attributes; method calls communicate with the JSII kernel for resource operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious dynamic code. The code appears to follow standard patterns for AWS CDK resource classes; no obfuscated or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CloudFormation resource class 'CfnProject' for AWS LookoutVision service, with associated properties and methods for resource management. It uses type hints, type checking, and JSII interactions consistent with AWS CDK constructs. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code functions solely to represent and manage cloud resources, with no evidence of data exfiltration, network connections, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, well-structured AWS CDK construct for creating a LookoutVision project. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is a legitimate component intended for infrastructure as code deployment.",
