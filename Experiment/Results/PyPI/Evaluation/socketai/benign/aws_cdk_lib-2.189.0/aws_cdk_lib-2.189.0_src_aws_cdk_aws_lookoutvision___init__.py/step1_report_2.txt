{
  "purpose": "Defines AWS CloudFormation resources for AWS LookoutVision projects using AWS CDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, jsii, publication, and AWS CDK modules; use of class constructors and property setters; type hints and type checks.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to jsii.create, jsii.invoke, and jsii.get, which interact with AWS CloudFormation resources.",
  "flows": "Construction of CfnProject objects with user-defined project_name; jsii methods called to create resources and retrieve attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of typeguard and jsii is standard for CDK constructs. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a CDK construct for AWS LookoutVision projects, including resource class definitions, properties, and type checks. No external input sources or data sinks are evident beyond standard CDK resource creation. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code adheres to normal patterns for AWS CDK resource constructs, with proper type validation and resource attribute access. Overall, this appears to be a legitimate infrastructure code for resource provisioning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard AWS CDK construct library for defining a LookoutVision project resource, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It primarily facilitates resource creation and attribute access for AWS services.",
