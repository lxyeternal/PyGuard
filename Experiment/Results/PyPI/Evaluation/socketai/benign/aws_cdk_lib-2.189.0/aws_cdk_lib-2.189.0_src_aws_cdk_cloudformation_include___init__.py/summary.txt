  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for including and manipulating CloudFormation templates within AWS CDK. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk is very low, primarily related to potential misconfiguration rather than inherent vulnerabilities."
