  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's functionality, potential security implications, and scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code provides classes and functions for including and manipulating CloudFormation templates in CDK, with resource access/modification, nested stacks, and parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes that methods like `get_resource`, `get_parameter`, `get_condition`, etc., can modify or access template elements, which could influence the resulting infrastructure.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Finds no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs. The code is a standard infrastructure management library.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low security risk (0.2), high confidence (0.9). No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly concludes that the code is a standard, safe library component. No malicious activity or malware is present. The risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue:** \"Empty response\" — no analysis provided.\n- **Assessment:** Cannot evaluate; no data.\n\n**Conclusion:** No meaningful review possible.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly identifies the code's role.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Notes that resource and template element access/modification could be misused, but emphasizes that the code itself is standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior. The code is a typical CDK utility.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very low security risk (0.1), high confidence (0.95). No malware detected.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's purpose. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description of the class's role.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes that resource access/modification could be misused but emphasizes standard usage.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code is a legitimate infrastructure utility.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low security risk (0.1), high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and thorough. No malware or malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the class's purpose.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Notes that resource retrieval/modification are confined to template management, with no external security concerns.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. Uses standard CDK patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No security risk, high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code's nature. It is a library for including and manipulating CloudFormation templates, with no malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** The overall security risk is very low, given the code's purpose and the lack of malicious indicators.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, well-structured code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal risk, typical infrastructure code)\n\n**Note:** The code is a standard, well-documented library for including and manipulating CloudFormation templates in AWS CDK. It performs resource access and modifications, which are expected features, but no signs of malicious intent or malware are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 (very low, typical of infrastructure management libraries)\n\nAll reports are consistent with this assessment.",
