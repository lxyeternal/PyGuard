  "purpose": "Library and class definitions for importing and manipulating existing CloudFormation templates within AWS CDK applications, including resource access and modification capabilities.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration and template file paths during class initialization, and accesses template elements such as conditions, resources, parameters, mappings, outputs, and nested stacks through method calls.",
  "sinks": "Methods that return resources or template elements, such as getResource, getParameter, getOutput, getCondition, getMapping, getHook, getRule, get_nested_stack, load_nested_stack, and get_nested_stack, can lead to data access or modification, but only within the context of the CDK template being built. No untrusted input is directly used in security-critical operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input parameters during class instantiation (template files, resource IDs, mappings) to the internal template representation, and from method calls retrieving resources/elements to potential modifications or references used in CDK constructs. No external data flows directly into security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a CDK construct for CloudFormation template inclusion. It uses well-established patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a library for including and modifying CloudFormation templates within AWS CDK. It uses safe practices like type hints and explicit method parameters. All operations are confined to template inclusion, resource retrieval, and modifications, which are expected behaviors for such a library. No external inputs are used insecurely, and no code indicates malicious intent or sabotage. The functions only access and mutate the template elements, and the design relies on user-supplied files and parameters. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or security breaches.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate, standard library for managing CloudFormation templates in AWS CDK. It does not contain malicious code, sabotage, or malware. It follows normal patterns for infrastructure-as-code tooling. Overall, the security risk is negligible.",
