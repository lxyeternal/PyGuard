{
  "purpose": "A Python module defining a class for including and manipulating existing CloudFormation templates within the AWS CDK, supporting resource and template element access and modifications.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, jsii, publication, typeguard, constructs, and AWS CDK modules; class and function definitions.",
  "sinks": "Function calls to jsii.invoke, jsii.create, and typeguard.check_type; property accessors; resource and element retrieval methods; resource modification code.",
  "flows": "Initialization of CfnInclude instances via jsii.create, resource and element retrieval through methods like get_resource and get_parameter, modification of resource properties, and access to nested stacks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or system damage routines present. Usage of jsii and dynamic invocation is standard for CDK constructs. No obfuscation or misleading code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a class definition for integrating existing CloudFormation templates into CDK applications, with methods for resource access and modification, nested stack handling, and parameter substitution. The use of jsii for interoperability with CDK is standard. No malicious behavior, such as data theft, system disruption, or unauthorized network activity, is evident. The code appears to be a legitimate part of the CDK library, providing infrastructure as code functionality. No anomalous patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic were identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard library implementation for including CloudFormation templates in CDK stacks. It contains no malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It is a typical, well-structured SDK class for infrastructure as code, with no security concerns detected.",
