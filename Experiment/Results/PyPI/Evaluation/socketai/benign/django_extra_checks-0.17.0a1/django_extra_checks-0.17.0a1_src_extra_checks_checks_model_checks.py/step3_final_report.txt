  "purpose": "Django model validation checks for attributes, meta options, and admin registration to ensure models adhere to best practices.",
  "sources": "Reads model class attributes, _meta properties, app registry, and admin site registrations.",
  "sinks": "Internal validation messages; no external data sinks or system calls.",
  "flows": "Source data (model attributes, meta info) flows through validation methods to generate internal check messages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static inspection of Django models, attributes, and admin registration. It uses Django APIs to verify presence of attributes, meta options, and registration status. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or external data processing are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to standard Django practices. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are observed. The validation logic is static and safe, primarily used for code quality enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Django validation extension with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It performs static checks to ensure models have required attributes and are properly registered in admin. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately zero, with minimal risk due to the nature of validation logic. Overall, the code is safe and standard.",
