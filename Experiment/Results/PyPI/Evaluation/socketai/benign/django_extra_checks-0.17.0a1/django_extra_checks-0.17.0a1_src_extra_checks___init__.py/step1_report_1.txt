  "purpose": "This code defines an __all__ list for module exports and imports the CheckId class from a relative module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module: from .check_id import CheckId",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or exposed",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as no runtime data handling or untrusted input is shown",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement and an __all__ declaration. It does not perform any data processing, I/O, or potentially malicious actions. The import is a standard relative import from a local module. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving the purpose of defining public API exports and importing a class. No malicious intent or security risks are identified.",
