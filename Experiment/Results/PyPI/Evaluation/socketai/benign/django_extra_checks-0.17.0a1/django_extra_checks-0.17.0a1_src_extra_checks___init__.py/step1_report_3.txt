  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; no data processing, network operations, or untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing CheckId from a local module and exposing it via __all__, which does not involve any data or control flow that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code, hard-coded secrets, or suspicious behaviors present in this minimal snippet.",
