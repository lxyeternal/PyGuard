  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies, secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a simple import statement and an export list. It only makes the CheckId class available for other modules. There are no data handling, user input, or network operations. No obfuscated or suspicious code features are present. This is a standard, minimal module definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module export with no malicious intent or security issues. It merely re-exports a class for external use. No risks or malicious behaviors are present.",
