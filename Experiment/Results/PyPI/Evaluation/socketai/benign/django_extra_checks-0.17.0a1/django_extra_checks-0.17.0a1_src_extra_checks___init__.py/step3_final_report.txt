  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports the CheckId class from a local module check_id and exposes it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module check_id during import.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the import statement to the module's namespace, with no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module pattern, importing a class and exposing it via __all__. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided code snippet is benign, with no data processing, network activity, or suspicious logic. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence scores are high, and the reasoning is consistent. The only external concern could be the contents of check_id.py, but that is outside the scope of this snippet. Overall, the code is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal module import/export pattern with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores and assessments are accurate and justified.",
