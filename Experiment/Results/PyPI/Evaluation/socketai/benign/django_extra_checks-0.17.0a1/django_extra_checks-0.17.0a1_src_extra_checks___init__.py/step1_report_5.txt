{
  "purpose": "This code exports the CheckId class from a local module for use in other parts of the project.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.check_id), which may contain additional code.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input or sensitive data; the code only defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a local module and declares it for export via __all__. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or security-critical actions. The only potential concern is the contents of check_id.py, which is not provided, but the given snippet itself shows no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module export with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely defines an API for other modules to import CheckId.",
