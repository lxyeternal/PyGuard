  "flows": "Import checks -> AppConfig ready() -> registry.bind()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's AppConfig and local modules, then defines a subclass ExtraChecksConfig that overrides the ready() method to call registry.bind(). This pattern is standard in Django for initializing app-specific setup code. The registry.bind() call could potentially execute arbitrary code depending on the implementation of 'registry', but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone. The code itself appears straightforward and does not contain malicious constructs such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected within this module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Django app configuration that initializes checks and registry binding during app startup. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks based on the provided code. The main concern depends on the implementation of 'registry.bind()', which is not available here, but the pattern itself is standard.",
