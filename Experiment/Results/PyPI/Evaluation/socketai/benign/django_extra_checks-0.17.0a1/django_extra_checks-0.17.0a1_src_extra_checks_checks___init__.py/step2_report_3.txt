  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the assessments are reasonable, consistent, and justified.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe import statements of local modules, primarily for validation or testing.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- The use of wildcard imports ('*') from local modules is noted but common in internal package code; it can obscure what symbols are imported but isn't inherently malicious.\n- The optional import with try-except is standard practice for handling optional dependencies.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report-by-Report Analysis:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Score:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.1\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity or obfuscation is evident.\n  - The security risk score is very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Verdict:**\n  - The score seems appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Score:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.1\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Similar to Report 1, the analysis correctly notes the benign nature.\n  - The use of wildcard imports is acknowledged but not suspicious.\n- **Verdict:**\n  - The scores are reasonable; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Score:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The report explicitly states no malicious activity or security issues.\n  - The confidence is high (1), which aligns with the reasoning.\n- **Verdict:**\n  - The score is appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Score:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The reasoning is consistent; no suspicious behavior detected.\n  - The use of wildcard imports is noted but not suspicious.\n- **Verdict:**\n  - The scores are justified and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Score:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Same as others; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n  - The analysis aligns with the code snippet.\n- **Verdict:**\n  - The scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n- The low security risk scores (0.1 or 0) are justified given the context.\n- Malware scores are zero across all reports, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk score:** Could be kept at 0 or slightly increased to 0.1 if a conservative stance is preferred, but given the benign nature, 0 is reasonable.\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n- The reports are consistent and justified.\n- The code is standard internal package import code with no security concerns.\n- No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if being very cautious)\n\nThis reflects the benign, straightforward nature of the code snippet.",
