  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and any potential discrepancies.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements, mainly static imports of internal modules, with a try-except for optional import.\n- They note the use of wildcard imports ('*'), which can obscure imported symbols but are common in internal packages.\n- No reports identify any actual data flow, external network activity, or handling of untrusted input.\n- Malware, obfuscation, and security risks are scored as zero or near-zero across all reports.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is purely import statements; there are no dynamic behaviors, no data processing, and no evident malicious activity.\n- Wildcard imports ('*') are used, which can be a code quality concern but not inherently malicious.\n- The optional import wrapped in try-except is standard practice for optional dependencies.\n\n### Errors or Flaws in the Reports:\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. No report claims malicious activity or data leaks.\n- Some reports mention that wildcard imports can obscure symbols, which is accurate but not a security issue per se.\n- No report suggests that the code performs any suspicious actions beyond module imports.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- Malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Security risk scores are very low (0.1 or 0), which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n### Potential Overestimations:\n- Since the code is just imports, the malware and obfuscation scores could be confidently set to zero.\n- The security risk scores could also be zero, as there's no indication of any security concern.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                   | No malicious activity or code behavior present             |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                   | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected           |\n| Security Risk    | 0                   | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or suspicious patterns    |\n\n**Overall, the code appears benign, with no security issues.**",
