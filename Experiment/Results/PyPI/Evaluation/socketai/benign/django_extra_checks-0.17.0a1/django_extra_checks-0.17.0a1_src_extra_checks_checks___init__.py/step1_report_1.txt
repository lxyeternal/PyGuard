  "purpose": "Import various check modules, likely for validation or testing purposes within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing local modules, potentially from the same package.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flow from sources to sinks observed in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports with wildcard imports ('*') can obscure actual imported content but is common in internal packages; no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs module imports, including a try-except block to optionally import 'drf_serializer_checks'. The use of wildcard imports ('*') from local modules can make it harder to track specific imported functions or classes but is typical in internal modules. No external input, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected in this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import pattern used within a package to load internal modules, with no evidence of malicious activity or security issues. It is straightforward and appears benign.",
