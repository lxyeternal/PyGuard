  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements of internal modules, with some use of wildcard imports and a try-except block for optional imports.\n- No reports identify any actual data flow, network activity, or processing of untrusted input.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or code injection.\n- Wildcard imports are noted as a potential code quality concern but not inherently malicious.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), indicating the reviewers are quite certain about benignity.\n- Malware scores are consistently zero across all reports, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No actual issues or malicious code are present in the code snippet.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The main concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can obscure the namespace and make static analysis harder, but this is common in internal package code.\n- **Scores:** The assigned malware scores (0) seem appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the benign nature, the security risk scores are appropriately low (0.1 or 0), aligning with the absence of security concerns.\n- **Malware justification:** Since no malicious activity is detected, malware scores are justified at zero.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** No unwarranted assumptions are made; the reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Score consistency:** The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly identify that the code is benign and standard for package initialization.\n- Wildcard imports are flagged as a potential concern but are not malicious.\n- The optional import handling is standard practice and does not introduce security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to wildcard imports, which are a code quality concern but not a security issue)\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard import pattern with no security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
