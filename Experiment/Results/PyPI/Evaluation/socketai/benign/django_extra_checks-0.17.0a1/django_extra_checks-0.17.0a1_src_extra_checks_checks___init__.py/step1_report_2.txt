{
  "purpose": "Import various check modules for validation or analysis purposes within a larger package.",
  "sources": "Module imports (local package modules such as model_checks, model_field_checks, self_checks, drf_serializer_checks).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports are performed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports with wildcard imports (from ... import *), which can obscure actual imported symbols and potentially hide malicious or unintended code. The try-except block for optional import of drf_serializer_checks is standard but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module imports, including optional import handling. Wildcard imports can obscure what code is brought into the namespace but are not inherently malicious. No external data sources, network activities, or sensitive operations are evident. The code appears to serve as an initialization or setup script for a package, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import setup, with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. The use of wildcard imports is not ideal but not suspicious in this context. Overall, the code appears benign.",
