  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: multiple relative imports with wildcard imports, including an optional import within a try-except block.\n- The code's purpose appears to be importing internal modules for validation or checks.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- Wildcard imports from local modules are generally discouraged but common in internal package code; they do not inherently indicate malicious activity.\n- The reports uniformly assign very low security risk and malware scores (mostly 0), which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The main concern might be the use of wildcard imports, which can obscure what is imported, but this is not inherently malicious.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, standard for internal package setup, and lacking in malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports give malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate. Security risk scores are also very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Since the code only performs static imports with no dynamic or external activity, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The use of wildcard imports can sometimes be a sign of obfuscation, but in this context, it is a common pattern in internal modules. The reports assign 0, which seems appropriate.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Given the absence of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or data leaks, the risk scores are correctly low.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities beyond the use of wildcard imports, which is acceptable here. No false positives are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but 0.1 is acceptable given the wildcard imports)  \n\nThe scores in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a minimal security concern primarily due to coding style (wildcard imports), but no actual malicious or vulnerable behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately conservative. The code is standard internal package setup code with no malicious intent or security issues. The scoring aligns well with the code's nature.",
