{
  "purpose": "The code imports internal modules related to checks and validations within a package, likely for internal testing or validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules, including a try-except block for optional import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules at startup; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') from local modules; optional import with try-except is standard but can obscure imported symbols.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements, including wildcard imports and an optional import. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs. Wildcard imports can reduce code clarity but are common in internal modules. The try-except for optional import is standard practice. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscated as 0, and security risk as 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal concern. The code's benign nature and lack of external interactions confirm the assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign internal module import pattern with no malicious intent or security issues. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
