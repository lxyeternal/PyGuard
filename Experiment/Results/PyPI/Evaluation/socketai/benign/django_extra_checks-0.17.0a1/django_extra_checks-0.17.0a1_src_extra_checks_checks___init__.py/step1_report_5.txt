{
  "purpose": "The code imports multiple modules related to checks, likely for validation or testing within a larger package.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the same package directory, which are presumed to contain check functions or classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; imports are static and do not involve runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The use of relative imports with 'from .module import *' could be suspicious in some contexts, but is common in package internal code. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, including a conditional import wrapped in try-except. No external data is read, no code execution, no network activity, or data leaks are observed. The pattern suggests modular importation of internal check functions, typical in a well-structured package. No anomalies indicating malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign part of a package's internal structure for importing various check modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
