{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom Django form fields and forms used for configuring checks and settings, likely in a security or validation context.",
  "sources": "Data sources include form inputs such as 'include_apps', 'level', 'checks', 'attrs', and 'skipif' fields, which may receive user-provided data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the use of untrusted data in validation logic, especially in 'checks' and 'skipif' fields, but no direct system calls, network access, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs into form fields, then through validation methods ('to_python', 'validate', 'clean', 'is_valid'), and finally into cleaned_data for further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. Usage of standard Django validation and form handling, no obfuscation, and no dynamic code execution or external network interactions are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines form classes with custom fields for handling lists, callables, and dictionaries, validating user inputs against predefined choices. It includes methods to clean and validate data, and to convert inputs into Python data structures. All operations rely on standard Django forms and fields, with no signs of malicious behavior or data exfiltration mechanisms. There are no suspicious external calls, code injections, or obfuscated segments. The only potential concern is that user input is processed and validated, but this is normal for form handling, and no dangerous actions are performed based on input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django form setup for configuration validation, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It handles user inputs carefully, validates data against known choices, and processes configurations securely. There are no indicators of supply chain attacks or malware.",
