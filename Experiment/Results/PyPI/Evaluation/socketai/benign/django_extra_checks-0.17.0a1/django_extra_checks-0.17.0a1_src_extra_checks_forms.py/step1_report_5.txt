{
  "purpose": "Defines custom Django form fields and forms for configuration, validation, and filtering of check settings, likely for a security or monitoring system.",
  "sources": "Imports from Django modules and a local CheckId; user-provided form data via request/validation flows.",
  "sinks": "Data processed within forms, including validation and conversion functions. No external sinks like network, file, or system commands are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data is received, validated and converted by to_python methods; then cleaned and validated; final processed data stored in self.cleaned_data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. Use of dynamic data validation appears standard. No malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom Django form fields for handling lists, callables, and union types, with appropriate validation. It processes configuration data for checks and levels, with no evidence of malicious data handling or system access. No unsafe code execution, network activity, or backdoors present. All code appears intended for safe data validation and structure enforcement within a web application context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Django form handling with custom fields, focused on validating and cleaning configuration data. No malicious intent or malware signs are evident. The design appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
