{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom Django form fields and forms used for validating configuration data related to system checks, levels, and filters.",
  "sources": "User input data passed into form fields such as include_apps, level, checks, attrs, and skipif.",
  "sinks": "Validation methods that process input data; no dangerous sinks like network calls, system modifications, or code execution are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from form fields through to to_python and validate methods, then into cleaned_data, with controlled attribute access via choices.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Use of getattr on django.core.checks is controlled via choices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of Django forms with custom fields for lists, callables, unions, and dicts. Validation logic is straightforward, with no external calls or dangerous operations. The only minor point is the dynamic attribute access in clean_level, which is constrained by predefined choices, making it safe. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. The data flow is typical for form validation, and no anomalies or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs configuration validation without any malicious intent or obfuscation. The low malware score (0) and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate. Overall, the code appears safe from supply chain attacks or malicious sabotage.",
