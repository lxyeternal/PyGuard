{
  "purpose": "The code defines an abstract base class for creating custom Django system checks, allowing validation of objects with configurable severity levels and ignore rules.",
  "sources": "Import statements for warnings, abstract base classes, typing, and Django checks; class constructor parameters; message method.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not process untrusted data into dangerous sinks such as system commands, database queries, or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input to the constructor and methods is mostly configuration data or objects; the message method generates a check message. No external data flows or untrusted input processing are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard Django check infrastructure code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured abstract class for Django system checks, with standard patterns for ignore rules, message creation, and application of checks. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious data handling. It is designed for extensibility and clarity, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign Django check framework component with no malicious behavior detected. It is a legitimate part of a larger Django codebase intended for validation purposes.",
