{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for custom checks in a Django application, including configuration, message generation, and ignore logic.",
  "sources": "Imports from warnings, abc, collections, typing, django.core.checks, and internal modules.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data leaks, external calls, or sensitive operations observed.",
  "flows": "Constructor sets attributes; __call__ method iterates over check results, applying ignore logic; message method creates check messages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a structured framework for defining and executing custom Django checks, with methods for ignoring certain objects, generating messages, and handling check execution flow. No external network operations, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. The code uses standard Django check patterns and Python idioms. The only notable aspect is the use of warnings for deprecation, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured framework for custom Django checks with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
