{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract base class for custom checks within a Django application, facilitating validation and warning mechanisms.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters during instantiation and method calls, but primarily relies on provided objects and parameters.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this code where untrusted data is used in a security-sensitive manner, such as executing code or interacting with external systems.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves instantiating check objects, invoking them with data objects, and generating messages based on check results.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no unusual or obfuscated constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class for checks, with mechanisms for skipping, ignoring, and generating messages. It uses standard Django check messaging structures, no user input or external data processing present. No suspicious code or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation for defining custom Django checks. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or supply chain security risks.",
