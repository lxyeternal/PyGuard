  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, well-structured Django framework component for defining custom checks.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows involving untrusted input are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets.\n- Use of warnings.warn for deprecation notices is standard and not suspicious.\n- The code relies on standard Python and Django mechanisms, with no external or network activity.\n\n**Assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is an abstract base class designed for extensibility and clarity, not for malicious purposes.\n- The logic is straightforward: setting up check attributes, ignoring rules, message creation, and applying checks.\n- No dynamic code execution, external command invocation, or data leaks are present.\n- The code does not process untrusted input in a way that could lead to code injection or data exfiltration.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, and I concur. There is no malicious behavior or payload.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, and I agree. The code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code is a benign framework component.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no suspicious activity is detected.\n- The use of warnings.warn is standard for deprecation notices.\n- The code does not contain any dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, the code is a benign, standard Django check framework component with no malicious or security risk indications.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware        | 0                 | No malicious behavior detected.                            |\n| obfuscated     | 0                 | Clear, straightforward code.                              |\n| security risk  | 0                 | No security risks identified.                              |\n\nThis aligns with the consensus in the reports and the code analysis.\n\n**Final note:** No adjustments needed; the code is safe and standard.",
