  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for creating custom Django system checks, managing check levels, ignore rules, and message generation.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters such as level, ignore_objects, ignore_types, and skipif; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Method calls and attribute accesses within class methods; no external data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured framework component for Django checks. It employs standard Python and Django idioms, with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The use of warnings.warn is standard for deprecation notices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django check framework component with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk behaviors. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
