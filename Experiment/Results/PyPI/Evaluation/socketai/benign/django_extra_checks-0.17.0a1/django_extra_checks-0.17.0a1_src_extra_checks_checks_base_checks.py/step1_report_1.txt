{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract base class for custom checks within a Django application, facilitating the creation and handling of various validation or warning checks.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes, method parameters, and imported modules. It does not read external or untrusted input sources directly.",
  "sinks": "The code generates Django check messages and warnings but does not output or transmit untrusted data or system information externally.",
  "flows": "The flow involves instantiating check objects, calling them with objects to validate, which then produce check messages if conditions are met; no external data transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The use of warnings.warn for deprecation notices is standard practice. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Django check framework component. It uses standard Python features, abstract classes, and Django's checking mechanisms. No external data input, malicious commands, or suspicious behaviors are present. The class methods primarily create and yield check messages based on conditions. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malware. The code is well-structured and adheres to common practices for plugin/check design.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard framework component for defining custom Django checks. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
