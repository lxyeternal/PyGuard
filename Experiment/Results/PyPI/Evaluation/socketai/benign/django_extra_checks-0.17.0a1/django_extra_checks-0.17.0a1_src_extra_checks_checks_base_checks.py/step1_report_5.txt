  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract base class for implementing custom checks within the Django framework, specifically for static code analysis or runtime validation related to Django applications.",
  "sources": "Code reads class attributes, method parameters, and imported modules; no external data sources or user inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no network, file, or database interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the code primarily sets up a framework for checks and warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The code is standard for a Django check framework.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'BaseCheck' with properties for check levels, ignore rules, and a message generation method. It uses standard Python and Django modules, with no suspicious code paths or malicious behavior. No external data handling, network activity, or code injection features are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a Django static analysis or validation framework, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard framework for defining custom Django checks with no indication of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be well-structured and safe.",
