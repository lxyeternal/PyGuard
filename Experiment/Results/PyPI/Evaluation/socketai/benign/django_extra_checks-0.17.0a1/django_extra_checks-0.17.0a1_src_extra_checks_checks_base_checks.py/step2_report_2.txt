  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured abstract base class for defining custom Django checks.\n- It uses standard Python and Django constructs.\n- No external data sources, network operations, or data leaks are present.\n- The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or contain hardcoded secrets.\n- Warnings.warn is used for deprecation notices, which is standard.\n- The code does not contain any suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies that this is a base class for Django checks.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No external data or untrusted input, no data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** The conclusion that the code is benign and standard is accurate.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Security Risk: 0 — correct.\n  - Confidence: 1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, accurately describes the code.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** All zeroes for malware, obfuscated, and security risk; confidence at 1.0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n\n- Same conclusions as above; no suspicious activity, no external data handling, no malicious patterns.\n- Scores are all zero, confidence at 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n\n- Also aligns with previous reports: standard Django check framework code, no malicious intent.\n- Scores are all zero, confidence at 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n\n- Same consistent reasoning; no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- Scores are all zero, confidence at 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently rate 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or security issues present.\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- No report overestimates the risk or malware scores.\n- The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n- The code is a typical framework component, not an attack vector or malicious payload.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores are reasonable and justified. No changes needed.",
