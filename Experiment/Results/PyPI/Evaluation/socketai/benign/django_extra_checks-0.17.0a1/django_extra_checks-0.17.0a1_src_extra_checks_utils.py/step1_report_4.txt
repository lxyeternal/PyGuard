{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to recursively collect all subclasses of given base classes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'bases' which is an iterable of classes; class attribute '__subclasses__()' which retrieves subclasses.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or external communication; no data leaks or malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Input 'bases' -> recursive call to 'collect_subclasses' -> yield of classes, including subclasses.",
  "anomalies": "Use of recursive generator, but no anomalies or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to gather all subclasses of specified classes recursively by using '__subclasses__()'. It maintains a 'visited' set to avoid duplicates and infinite loops. No external input/output beyond class introspection. No signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The implementation appears standard and safe for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility function for introspecting class hierarchies. No malicious or security-threatening behavior detected.",
