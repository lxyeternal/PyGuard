{
  "purpose": "Recursively collects all subclasses of given base classes using class introspection.",
  "sources": "The 'bases' parameter (an iterable of class types), and the '__subclasses__()' method of classes.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Input classes from 'bases' -> '__subclasses__()' calls -> recursive collection with 'visited' set to prevent duplicates.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, uses standard Python features, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a recursive generator function that yields all subclasses of input classes, tracking visited classes to avoid infinite loops. It employs standard class introspection via '__subclasses__()' and recursion. No external data, network, or file I/O is involved. The implementation is clear, correct, and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The use of a 'visited' set ensures termination and correctness. The code is a typical utility for class hierarchy analysis, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for class hierarchy introspection. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
