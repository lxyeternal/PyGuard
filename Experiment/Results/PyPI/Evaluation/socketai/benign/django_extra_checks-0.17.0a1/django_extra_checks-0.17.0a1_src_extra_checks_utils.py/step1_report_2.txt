{
  "purpose": "The code recursively collects all subclasses of given base classes, likely for introspection or type analysis.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'bases' which is an iterable of types; internal attribute '__subclasses__()' of classes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data; no network, file, or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "From 'bases' input -> through recursive calls to 'collect_subclasses' -> yields classes; no external data flow or untrusted sink.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code. Use of recursion with 'visited' set for cycle prevention is standard. No obfuscation or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The function accepts an iterable of base classes, maintains a set of visited classes to prevent repeated processing, and recursively yields subclasses via '__subclasses__()'. The implementation is straightforward and uses standard Python features for class introspection. No signs of malicious intent or malicious data handling are evident. The code performs safe introspection without side effects or external data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation for collecting subclasses of given classes. No malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation detected. It appears to be legitimate utility code for class introspection.",
