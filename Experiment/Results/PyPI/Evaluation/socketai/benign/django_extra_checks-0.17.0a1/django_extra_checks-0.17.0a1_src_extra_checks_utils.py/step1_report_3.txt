{
  "purpose": "The function 'collect_subclasses' recursively collects all subclasses of the given base classes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'bases', which is an iterable of class types.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data is written to external systems, files, or network.",
  "flows": "Input 'bases' flows into recursive calls; subclasses are yielded back to the caller.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses recursion and set to avoid duplicates; no obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic function that takes an iterable of class types and recursively yields all subclasses without repetition. It employs standard Python features, such as type hints, recursion, and set for tracking visited classes. No external data sources, file I/O, network access, or execution of untrusted code is evident. The logic is straightforward and intended for class hierarchy traversal. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility function for collecting subclasses of given classes. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and purposeful for introspection purposes.",
