  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class for various check identifiers with a method to find a check by value.",
  "sources": "The class CheckId, its class method find_check, and the ALL_CHECKS_NAMES constant.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "Input to find_check method (a string) flows to enum instantiation and lookup; no external data flows to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code appears straightforward and typical for enum definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with specific string values, including a class method to find an enum member from a string. It uses exception handling for safe lookups and constructs a set of all enum values. No dynamic execution, network operations, or data leaks are present. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard enum definition with a helper method for lookups. There are no malicious behaviors, supply chain security issues, or security risks identified.",
