  "purpose": "Defines a string-based enumeration CheckId for various check identifiers and provides a method to find a check by its string value.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static enum members and a class method for lookup.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Input string to find_check method, which attempts to retrieve enum member via constructor or internal map.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant try-except block in find_check; commented-out enum members indicating removal, but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static enum class with string values representing check IDs. The find_check method safely retrieves enum members, handling invalid inputs gracefully. No external data, network operations, or dynamic code execution are involved. The use of exception handling is standard, and no obfuscation or malicious constructs are present. Commented-out lines are benign. The overall structure is straightforward and safe, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk being appropriate. The code's simplicity and lack of external dependencies or dynamic behavior confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static enumeration utility with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for supply chain use, and the current risk scores are appropriate.",
