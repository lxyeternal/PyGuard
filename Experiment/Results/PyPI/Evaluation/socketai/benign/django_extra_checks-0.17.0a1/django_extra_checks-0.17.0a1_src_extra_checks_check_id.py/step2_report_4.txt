  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines an enum class `CheckId` inheriting from `str` and `enum.Enum`, representing various check identifiers.\n   - It includes a class method `find_check` that attempts to retrieve an enum member by its string value, first via the constructor and then via the `_member_map_`.\n   - The code also defines `ALL_CHECKS_NAMES` as a frozenset of all enum values.\n   - Several enum members are commented out, indicating removal or deprecation.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code is purely static, defining constants and lookup methods.\n   - There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network operations, and no dynamic code execution.\n   - The use of exception handling around enum lookups is standard and safe.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious logic are present.\n   - The commented-out lines are benign and do not impact security.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly describe the code as a straightforward enum utility with no malicious intent, no external data handling, and no security risks.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no obfuscation or malware.\n   - The reasoning is consistent across reports, emphasizing the static and safe nature of the code.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1.0), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - The reasoning in each report is sound and consistent.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is static and safe.\n   - The `find_check` method handles invalid inputs gracefully, which is good practice.\n   - The commented-out enum members are harmless and likely for future or deprecated checks.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a standard enum class with a lookup method.\n   - No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n   - The code does not pose any supply chain security risks.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is well-structured, with clear intent and safe practices.\n- The use of exception handling and enum features is appropriate and safe.\n- The commented-out lines are benign and do not affect security.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, static enumeration utility with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
