  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a `CheckId` enum inheriting from `str` and `enum.Enum`.\n- Enum members are string identifiers for various checks.\n- Provides a class method `find_check` that attempts to retrieve an enum member from a string input, first via constructor, then via `_member_map_`.\n- Has a frozenset `ALL_CHECKS_NAMES` containing all enum values.\n- No external inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code appears correct and straightforward; no errors, flaws, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- **Functionality:** The `find_check` method safely retrieves enum members, handling invalid inputs gracefully.\n- **Obfuscation or malicious intent:** None detected; the code is standard enum usage.\n- **External data handling:** No external data, network, or untrusted inputs are processed.\n- **Commented-out lines:** These are benign and indicate removed checks, not malicious obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring and Justification:\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Security Risk Score | Comments |\n|----------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|----------|\n| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | The code is a benign enum utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. |\n| 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Same as above; standard enum pattern, no external data or malicious behavior. |\n| 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Straightforward enum with safe lookup; no issues. |\n| 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | No signs of maliciousness or obfuscation. |\n| 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Consistent with others; safe static enum definition. |\n\n**All reports** correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk components.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?** Yes. All scores are appropriately zero, reflecting the benign nature.\n- **Any assumptions or potential vulnerabilities?** No. The code only performs static enum lookups, with exception handling, which is safe.\n- **Is there any hidden malicious intent?** No evidence supports this.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, well-implemented enum utility for check identifiers with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain dependency appears safe and well-structured. No modifications to the scores are necessary. The overall assessment aligns with the reports' findings.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that the actual usage context does not introduce external vulnerabilities, but based solely on this code snippet, it is safe.",
