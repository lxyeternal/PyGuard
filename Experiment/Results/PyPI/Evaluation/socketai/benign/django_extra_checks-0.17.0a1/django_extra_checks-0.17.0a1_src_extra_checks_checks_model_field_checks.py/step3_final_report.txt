  "purpose": "Static analysis checks for Django models, enforcing best practices such as gettext usage, null/default configurations, index presence, and related_name settings.",
  "sources": "Model field attributes, AST representations, model meta options, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Generation of check messages based on model attribute conditions; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Inspection of model fields and AST args to generate validation messages; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Django model check classes and mixins that perform static validation on model fields and meta options. It reads data from model attributes and AST objects, generating messages if certain conditions are not met (e.g., missing verbose_name, help_text, null settings, related_name, or index configurations). There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The logic is standard for Django static analysis, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of static Django model validation checks with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and justified. The reports accurately reflect the benign and standard nature of the code.",
