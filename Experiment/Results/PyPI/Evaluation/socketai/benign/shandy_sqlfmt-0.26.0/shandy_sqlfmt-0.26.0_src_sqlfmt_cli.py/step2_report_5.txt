  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of individual reports:**\n\n- **Report 1:**  \n  *Purpose:* CLI for sqlfmt, no malicious activity.  \n  *Sources:* User input via CLI and env vars.  \n  *Sinks:* Output functions, exit codes.  \n  *Anomalies:* None detected.  \n  *Analysis:* Standard CLI wrapper, no dynamic code, network, or secrets.  \n  *Malware:* 0  \n  *Risk:* 0.1\n\n- **Report 2:**  \n  *Purpose:* CLI for sqlfmt, straightforward.  \n  *Sources:* CLI args, env vars, files.  \n  *Sinks:* File operations, output, exit.  \n  *Anomalies:* None.  \n  *Analysis:* Typical CLI, no suspicious behavior.  \n  *Malware:* 0  \n  *Risk:* 0.2\n\n- **Report 3:**  \n  *Purpose:* CLI for SQL formatting, standard.  \n  *Sources:* CLI, env vars, stdin (implied).  \n  *Sinks:* File system, output functions.  \n  *Anomalies:* None.  \n  *Analysis:* Uses external API, no malicious activity.  \n  *Malware:* 0  \n  *Risk:* 0.1\n\n- **Report 4:**  \n  *Purpose:* CLI for sqlfmt, no malicious intent.  \n  *Sources:* CLI, env vars, static input.  \n  *Sinks:* Output, report display.  \n  *Anomalies:* None.  \n  *Analysis:* Legitimate CLI, no malicious behavior.  \n  *Malware:* 0  \n  *Risk:* 0.2\n\n- **Report 5:**  \n  *Purpose:* CLI for sqlfmt, with options.  \n  *Sources:* CLI args, env vars, stdin.  \n  *Sinks:* Display functions, no network or code execution.  \n  *Anomalies:* None.  \n  *Analysis:* Standard utility, no suspicious activity.  \n  *Malware:* 0  \n  *Risk:* 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code or malware:**  \n  All reports agree that the code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around the sqlfmt formatting library, with no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  No obfuscated code is present. The code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code mainly handles user input, configuration, and output. There are no dangerous operations such as executing untrusted code, network calls, or handling secrets insecurely.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All malware scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis. The risk scores are low, reflecting the absence of security concerns.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the consistent findings across all reports, the code appears to be a typical CLI utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned seem reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to general CLI handling, not security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, and no adjustments to the scores are necessary. It is a legitimate CLI wrapper for a SQL formatting tool, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
