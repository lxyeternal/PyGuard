{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for the sqlfmt tool, which formats SQL files according to user-specified options and configurations.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments, environment variables, and files or directories specified by the user.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of external functions for file operations, printing output messages, and exiting the program with a specific code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs (files, options, environment variables) through configuration loading, into formatting functions, and finally to output display and process termination.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code primarily handles CLI options, configuration, and display logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical CLI wrapper around the sqlfmt formatting library. It loads configurations, manages command-line options, processes files, and displays results. It uses standard libraries and functions, with no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No input handling indicates potential injection risks, and no external network calls or credential management are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CLI implementation for a SQL formatter with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious anomalies. The design focuses on formatting and displaying output, with no hidden or malicious activities.",
