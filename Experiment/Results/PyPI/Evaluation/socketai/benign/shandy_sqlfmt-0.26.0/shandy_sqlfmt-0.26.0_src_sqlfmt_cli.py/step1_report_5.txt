  "purpose": "Defines a command-line interface for formatting SQL files using the sqlfmt tool, with options for configuration, reporting, and user guidance.",
  "sources": "Input from command-line arguments (files, flags, options), environment variables, and standard input.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if untrusted input is used in display functions; no explicit sinks for untrusted data that could lead to code execution or network communication.",
  "flows": "Command-line args/envvars -> configuration loading -> formatting process -> display report/output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up a command-line interface with numerous options for file handling, formatting, and reporting. It loads configurations, matches files, and displays output, including a welcome message. All operations involve standard libraries and the 'sqlfmt' package functions. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns are present. The code is well-structured and appears to serve its intended purpose without hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CLI utility for SQL formatting. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided source. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
