{
  "purpose": "The code defines a command-line interface for the sqlfmt tool, which formats SQL files according to specified options and configurations.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line options and arguments, particularly file paths and environment variables for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Output functions such as display_output and report.display_report, and the process exit codes based on formatting results.",
  "flows": "User input and environment variables influence configuration; files are matched and processed; reports are generated; output is displayed; exit codes are determined based on results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of external modules like click, sqlfmt.api, and report functions are standard. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a command-line interface for formatting SQL files, handling user options, and displaying results. It uses well-known libraries (click) and internal modules (api, report) without any indication of malicious behavior. The only input sources are command-line arguments and environment variables, which are safely used to configure the formatting process. Output functions and exit code logic are standard and do not perform any data leakage or system compromise. No obfuscated code, network activity, or suspicious file operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical CLI setup for a formatting tool with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It processes input files, applies formatting, and outputs reports securely. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
