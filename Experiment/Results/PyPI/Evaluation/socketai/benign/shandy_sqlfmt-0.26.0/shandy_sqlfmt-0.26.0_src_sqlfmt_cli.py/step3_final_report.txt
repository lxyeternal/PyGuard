  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper for the sqlfmt tool, handling user input, configuration, file matching, and report display.",
  "sources": "CLI arguments, environment variables, file paths, stdin (implied).",
  "sinks": "Standard output, report display, exit codes.",
  "flows": "Input sources (CLI args/env vars) to processing functions, then to output functions and exit codes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no dynamic execution, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI implementation using click, with safe handling of inputs and outputs. It does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or handle secrets insecurely. The logic is standard for CLI tools, and no malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. The environment variables are used solely for configuration, and the internal modules are assumed safe. The ASCII art and help messages are static and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe CLI wrapper for a SQL formatting library. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
