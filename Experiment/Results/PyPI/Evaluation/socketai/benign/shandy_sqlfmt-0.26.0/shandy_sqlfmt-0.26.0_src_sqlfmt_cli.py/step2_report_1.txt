  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's behavior, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code is a CLI wrapper for the sqlfmt tool, handling user input, configuration, file matching, and report display.\n- It uses standard libraries (click) and internal modules (api, report, config).\n- No suspicious or malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present.\n- The logic appears straightforward and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Review of Each Report**\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the CLI setup and input sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Mentions output functions and exit codes, consistent with code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no dynamic code, no network calls.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate; the code is standard CLI code with no malware.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low, justified by the potential for user misconfiguration but no actual risk)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard CLI behavior, no suspicious activity.  \n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), which is acceptable given the nature of static analysis.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (still very low, justified)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Also consistent with the previous assessments.  \n- Focuses on safe handling of inputs and outputs, no network or malicious code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same conclusion: standard CLI, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Consistent with prior evaluations, no suspicious behavior, safe handling.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment & Final Justification**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. I agree with 0 across the board.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero, reflecting the possibility of user misconfiguration or misuse, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no evidence of malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (minimal, mostly theoretical; no actual issues)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper for a formatting tool, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk scores are justified given the context, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at zero.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scoring, as they are well justified. No changes necessary.",
