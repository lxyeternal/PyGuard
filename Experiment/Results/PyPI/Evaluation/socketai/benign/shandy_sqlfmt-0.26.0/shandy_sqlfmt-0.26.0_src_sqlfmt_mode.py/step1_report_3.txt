  "purpose": "Defines a data class for configuration options related to SQL formatting, including dialect selection and color output preferences.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.environ.get('NO_COLOR'))",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variable for decision making in color property",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'NO_COLOR' influences the color property, which affects output formatting",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the environment variable usage is standard and safe",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration data class with various formatting options. It reads environment variables to determine output coloring, which is a common practice. The dialect selection is based on a dictionary lookup, with error handling for unsupported dialects. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage. The code's structure is standard, and it does not execute or process untrusted input beyond environment variable checks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration class with safe environment variable handling. No malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
