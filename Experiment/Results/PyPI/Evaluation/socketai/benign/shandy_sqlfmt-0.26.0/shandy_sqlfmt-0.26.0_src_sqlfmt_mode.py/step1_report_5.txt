  "purpose": "Define configuration for sqlfmt formatting tool, including dialect selection and display options.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get('NO_COLOR') for environment variable; input parameters for class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks that lead to security vulnerabilities; environment variable check influences color output.",
  "flows": "Environment variable NO_COLOR affects the color property output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of external dialects appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass 'Mode' with various configuration options, including dialect selection based on a string input. It safely maps dialect names to classes without executing arbitrary code. The color property checks environment variables and flags to determine whether to colorize output. There is no user input, file access, or network activity present. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are identified. The only external dependency is reading an environment variable, which is a common practice for configuring display options.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for a formatter tool, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly handles dialect selection and environment variable checks without executing untrusted code or leaking sensitive data.",
