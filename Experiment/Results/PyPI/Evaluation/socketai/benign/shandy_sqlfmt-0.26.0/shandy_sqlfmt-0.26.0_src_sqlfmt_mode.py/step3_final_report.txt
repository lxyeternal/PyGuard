  "purpose": "Configuration class for sqlfmt, managing dialect selection, output preferences, and environment variable handling.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'NO_COLOR' accessed via os.environ; dialect mapping dictionary; class initialization parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; environment variable read is safe; exception handling for unsupported dialects is standard.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'NO_COLOR' influences the 'color' property; dialect name input mapped to class instance; exception raised on invalid dialect.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; environment variable access is standard; no obfuscation or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration class that manages user preferences and dialect selection for sqlfmt. It safely reads environment variables, handles invalid dialects with exceptions, and uses clear, standard Python idioms. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present. The environment variable 'NO_COLOR' is used in a typical manner to control output coloring. Exception handling is appropriate and does not introduce security issues. The assigned malware scores are zero, and the security risk scores are minimal, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard configuration class with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The environment variable handling and error management are appropriate. Overall, it poses no security risk.",
