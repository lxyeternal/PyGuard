  "purpose": "Define configuration settings for sqlfmt, including dialect selection, formatting options, and output preferences.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get('NO_COLOR') in the color property method; class attribute values; imported modules and their constants.",
  "sinks": "os.environ.get('NO_COLOR') in the color property method (reads environment variable); no other direct data sinks or outputs.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'NO_COLOR' influences the output color setting via the color property; no external data flows or untrusted inputs affecting system state.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The code primarily manages configuration and environment variable reading.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass 'Mode' for configuration management. It includes environment variable access in the color property, which is standard for such features. The class maps dialect names to classes, with error handling for unsupported dialects. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The environment variable 'NO_COLOR' is read for output preferences, which is typical. No unsafe code practices, SQL injections, or data leaks are present. The overall code appears to be legitimate configuration logic without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration class for sqlfmt, managing formatting options and environment-dependent output settings. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to configure formatting behavior based on user preferences and environment variables.",
