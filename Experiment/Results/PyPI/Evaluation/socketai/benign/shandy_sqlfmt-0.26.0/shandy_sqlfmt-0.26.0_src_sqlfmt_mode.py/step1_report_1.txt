  "purpose": "Defines configuration settings for a SQL formatting tool, including dialect selection and output preferences.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (NO_COLOR), input parameters during class instantiation (dialect_name, color flags), external imports (os, Path, data classes, dialects).",
  "sinks": "os.environ.get('NO_COLOR') that influences output behavior.",
  "flows": "Environment variable NO_COLOR -> color property logic -> affects output coloring; class instantiation -> dialect selection -> raises exception if invalid.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up configuration options for a SQL formatter, including environment-aware coloring logic and dialect selection. No malicious code or suspicious data flow patterns are present. The environment variable access is standard for controlling output behavior. Exception handling for unsupported dialects is appropriate. No obfuscated code or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration class for a SQL formatting tool with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
