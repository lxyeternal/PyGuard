{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for formatting Python and Jinja code snippets, utilizing the 'black' formatter when available, and handling Jinja syntax parsing, multiline tags, and string replacements to ensure valid syntax.",
  "sources": "String inputs from code snippets, including Jinja tags and Python code segments; optional import of 'black'; regex replacements for reserved words and tildes.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; internal string manipulations and formatting functions operate solely on input strings without external system calls or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input strings are preprocessed (reserved words and tildes replaced), optionally formatted with 'black', then postprocessed to revert replacements; Jinja tags are parsed and possibly reformatted, with code modifications confined within string manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex replacements for reserved words and tildes could, in rare cases, alter code semantics; dynamic import of 'black' is handled safely with exception handling; no suspicious or malicious code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility focused on formatting and parsing code snippets, with safe practices such as optional dependencies and exception handling. String replacements are standard for formatting purposes and do not execute code or access external resources. AST parsing for multiline detection is safe and does not introduce vulnerabilities. No network activity, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's structure is clear, and the operations are confined to string manipulations and formatting logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for formatting Python and Jinja code snippets. It employs safe practices, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor string replacements are typical for formatting tools and do not pose security risks.",
