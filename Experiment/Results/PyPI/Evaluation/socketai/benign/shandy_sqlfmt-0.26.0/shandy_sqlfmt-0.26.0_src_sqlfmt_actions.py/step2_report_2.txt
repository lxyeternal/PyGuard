  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes functions for lexing, tokenizing, and parsing SQL/Jinja, with source data coming from regex matches and source_string slices.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious data flows are identified; data flows are internal, from source_string to tokens/nodes.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The nested token handling appears legitimate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard lexer/parser for SQL/Jinja with no malicious intent. It manages tokens, nested structures, and errors appropriately.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; source data from source_string and regex matches.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious external actions; functions generate tokens and manage parser state.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of obfuscation or backdoors; standard regex/token logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code functions as a typical parser/lexer, with no malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, similar lexing/parsing functions, handling nested tokens, comments, Jinja blocks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks; internal token creation and buffer management.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns; exception handling for lexing states is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behaviors detected; standard parsing logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Functions for lexing, tokenizing, handling nested structures, similar to previous reports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious data flows; internal token and node management.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or backdoors; regex and exception handling are typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard lexing/parsing code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functions for lexing and nested token handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external effects or malicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation; standard token management.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate parser/lexer code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently assign 0, and there's no evidence of malicious behavior. The code is purely for lexing and parsing.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all reports; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2), reflecting the internal complexity but no evident security threat.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — minimal, mainly due to internal complexity, not malicious intent.\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is a well-structured, standard lexing/parsing utility for SQL and Jinja templates. It does not exhibit any malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
