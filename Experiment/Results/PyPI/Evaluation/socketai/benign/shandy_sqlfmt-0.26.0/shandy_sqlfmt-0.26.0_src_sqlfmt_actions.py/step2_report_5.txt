  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: code presence, logical soundness, potential security issues, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a lexing/parsing module for SQL and Jinja templates.\n- The source of data is mainly regex matches and source_string slices.\n- No evidence of malicious activities such as network access, file system modifications, or code injection.\n- The code uses exception handling for lexing state management, which is standard.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are identified.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, and the security risks are low (~0.2).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code presence:** The code is present and functional as a lexing/parsing utility.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No evidence of vulnerabilities like code injection, data leaks, or insecure regex usage.\n\n### Logical Flaws:\n- The functions appear well-structured, with appropriate error handling.\n- The nested token handling via `handle_potentially_nested_tokens` is complex but appears legitimate.\n- Use of regex for nested structures is common in parsers.\n- No suspicious assumptions or faulty logic are evident.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score (~0.2):** Slightly above zero, reflecting minimal inherent risk in parsing code, but no real security concern.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable; no changes needed.\n- The detailed reasoning in each report aligns with the code's intent and structure.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0.2** |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured lexing/parsing utility for SQL and Jinja templates.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or vulnerable aspects are present.\n- The low security risk score is appropriate given the context.\n\n**Final note:** Given the comprehensive review, I concur with the provided scores. The supply chain risk here appears minimal, and the code is safe under typical static analysis assumptions.",
