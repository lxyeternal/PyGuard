  "purpose": "Defines a ROOT_DIR variable pointing to a directory three levels above the current file location.",
  "sources": "The code reads the special variable __file__ to determine the current file's location.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is transmitted or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A - no untrusted data flows or processing occurs beyond reading __file__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward path resolution without complex or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path from pathlib and resolves the current file's path to set ROOT_DIR to its grandparent directory. This is a common pattern for setting project root directories. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The code performs a simple, safe operation and does not interact with external inputs or outputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard directory resolution without malicious intent or security risks.",
