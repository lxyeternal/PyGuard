  "purpose": "Define the ROOT_DIR variable as the grandparent directory of the current script's location.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __file__ attribute to determine the script's file path.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is written to external systems or leaked.",
  "flows": "The code reads __file__, resolves the path, and navigates up three directory levels.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard use of pathlib to determine directory paths.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path from pathlib, then sets ROOT_DIR to the directory three levels above the current script's location. It uses __file__ to obtain the script's path, resolves it to an absolute path, and navigates upward using parent three times. No dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are evident. This is standard path handling code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign; it simply determines a directory path relative to the script's location. No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
