  "purpose": "Determine the project root directory based on the current file location.",
  "sources": "Reading the special variable __file__ and resolving the directory path.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "Input (__file__) -> Path resolution -> ROOT_DIR variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward path calculation with standard library.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path from pathlib and calculates the parent directory three levels above the current file's directory. This is typical for setting a base directory in a project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns. It only performs a directory path computation with no external data or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply determines the root directory relative to the current file location. It is standard, safe, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
