  "purpose": "Define the root directory path relative to the current script location.",
  "sources": "The script reads the special variable __file__ to determine the current script's filename and path.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "The code reads __file__, resolves its absolute path, and navigates up three directory levels.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, uses standard library functions, and does not contain any suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path from pathlib, then defines ROOT_DIR as the parent directory three levels above the current script's location. This is a common pattern for setting base paths in a project. No data is being transmitted, stored insecurely, or manipulated maliciously. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs present. The code is minimal and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign snippet used for directory path resolution within a project. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
