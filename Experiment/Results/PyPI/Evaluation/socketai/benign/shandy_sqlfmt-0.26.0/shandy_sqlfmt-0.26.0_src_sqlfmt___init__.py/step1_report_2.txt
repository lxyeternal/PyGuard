{
  "purpose": "Define the root directory path relative to the current file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the special variable __file__ to determine the current script's file path.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not output, send data, or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "Input (__file__) is used to compute ROOT_DIR; no further data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and minimal; no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path from pathlib to handle filesystem paths. It then resolves the current script's absolute path (__file__), moves up three directory levels, and assigns this to ROOT_DIR. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or data exfiltration. The code is standard for determining project root directory.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended to set a base directory path, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
