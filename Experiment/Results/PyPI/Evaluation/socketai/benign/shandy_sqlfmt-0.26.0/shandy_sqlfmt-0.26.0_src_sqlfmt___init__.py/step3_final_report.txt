  "purpose": "Define the project root directory relative to the script's location by resolving the current file path and navigating up three levels.",
  "sources": "__file__ variable providing the current script's path",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are used or affected",
  "flows": "Path(__file__).resolve() -> parent directories -> assignment to ROOT_DIR",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward path resolution with no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path from pathlib, resolves the current script's absolute path, navigates up three directory levels, and assigns this to ROOT_DIR. It uses standard library functions without processing untrusted input, performing network operations, or handling secrets. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly interpret the code as benign, with scores of malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, and confidence: 1, which are appropriate given the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe pattern for setting a project root directory relative to the script location. It poses no security risks, contains no malicious behavior, and is not obfuscated. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
