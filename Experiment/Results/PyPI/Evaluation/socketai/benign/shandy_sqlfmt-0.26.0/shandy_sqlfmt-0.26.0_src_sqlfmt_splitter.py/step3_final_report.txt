{
  "purpose": "A line splitter utility designed to analyze and split SQL or templated code lines based on syntax nodes and comments for formatting purposes.",
  "sources": "In-memory data structures such as Line, Node, and Comment objects, which provide input data for line analysis and splitting.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; operations are confined to internal data structures and in-memory processing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from Line objects through various node inspections and splitting functions, with no external system interactions or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. Assertions are used for internal consistency but do not pose security risks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, purely internal utility for formatting SQL or templated code lines. It inspects syntax nodes for splitting criteria, manages comments carefully, and avoids external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious formatting utility with no external or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified. The overall security risk is negligible.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
