{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to analyze and split lines of SQL-like code based on various syntactic criteria, likely for formatting or parsing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the method parameters 'line' (of type Line) and its attributes such as line.nodes, line.comments, and the input node in methods like maybe_split_before, maybe_split_between_brackets, etc.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources, perform network operations, or access environment variables; it manipulates in-memory data structures only.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input Line objects through various splitting and conditional logic to produce new Line objects, with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors. The logic is straightforward and pertains to syntax analysis. The code includes assertions to enforce assumptions, but no unsafe or malicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for splitting lines based on syntax rules, analyzing nodes for splitting criteria such as brackets, operators, comments, and query divisions. The methods utilize standard Python constructs and are focused on in-memory data manipulation. No external calls, network access, or system modifications are detected. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The code’s complexity appears to be for formatting or parsing purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign line splitter for SQL or templated code, with no indications of malicious intent or harmful side effects. It strictly manipulates internal data structures based on syntax rules, with no external data access or system modification. The overall security risk is very low.",
