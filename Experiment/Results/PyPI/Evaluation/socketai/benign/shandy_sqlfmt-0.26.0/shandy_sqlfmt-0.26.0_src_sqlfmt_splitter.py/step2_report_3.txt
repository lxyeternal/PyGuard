  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a line splitter for SQL or templated code, analyzing syntax nodes for splitting points. It uses assertions, but no external calls or malicious operations.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — very low, consistent with benign formatting code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence that the code is benign.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a benign line splitter with no malicious intent. The logic is clear, and no external or malicious operations are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, describing the code as a formatting utility that manipulates in-memory data structures without external effects.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no external risks.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — very high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's purpose. The code is a safe, internal line splitting utility with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, describes the code as a safe, in-memory line formatter with no external interactions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — still very low.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports. The code is a benign formatter, with no signs of malware or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar conclusion: a line splitting utility for formatting, with no external or malicious operations.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report accurately reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a safe SQL formatting component, with no malicious or external interactions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** The assessment is consistent with the code's purpose and structure.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a line splitter for SQL or templated code, operating solely on in-memory data structures for formatting purposes.\n- **Malware Indicators:** None of the reports identify any malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- **External Effects:** No network, file, or environment variable access is evident.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. Security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose as a formatter with no external effects, a risk score of **0.1 to 0.2** seems appropriate, aligning with the reports.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign, well-structured SQL line formatter with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, given the utility nature and lack of external interactions.\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's benign intent and safe profile.",
