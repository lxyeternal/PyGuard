{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for splitting SQL formatting lines based on certain rules, primarily for formatting purposes in a SQL code formatter.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from instances of Line, Node, and Comment objects, especially line.nodes, line.comments, and node properties such as is_newline, is_comma, is_operator, etc.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies and creates new Line objects, appends newlines via node_manager.append_newline, and manipulates comment objects. No external system or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input Line objects through node-based conditions to produce new Line instances with split nodes and associated comments.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears focused solely on line splitting logic; it does not include any suspicious code injection, data exfiltration, or network activity. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated constructs. Comments suggest the code is purely for formatting logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured SQL line formatter component, focusing on splitting lines based on node properties and comment handling. It evaluates nodes for splitting before and after, based on specific node flags (e.g., is_operator, is_comma, is_opening_bracket). It processes comments carefully to preserve inline and multiline comments during splits. There is no indication of malicious behavior, code injection, or external data handling. The logic is deterministic and solely related to code formatting. No network, file, or environment variable interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a safe, legitimate component for SQL code formatting. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or sabotage. The code's purpose is formatting, and it operates solely within its scope without external interactions.",
