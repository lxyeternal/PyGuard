{
  "purpose": "The code defines a data structure for representing and rendering lines of SQL code, managing formatting, comments, and syntax elements like brackets and Jinja blocks.",
  "sources": "Reads data from Node objects, previous_node, and Comment objects within the class properties and methods.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data flows internally for formatting and rendering purposes.",
  "flows": "Source nodes and comments are processed to generate formatted string output; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a line representation for a SQL formatter, with methods handling indentation, comment rendering, and syntax tracking. No external data handling, network operations, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code's logic is clear, and it serves a benign purpose related to code formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured component of a SQL formatter with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the security risk score is appropriate at 0, with a minor overcautious note in one report at 0.1 which can be adjusted to 0 for consistency.",
