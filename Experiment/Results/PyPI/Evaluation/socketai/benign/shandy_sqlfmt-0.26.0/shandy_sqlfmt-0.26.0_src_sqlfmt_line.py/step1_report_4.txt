{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and methods for representing and formatting lines of SQL code, managing nodes, comments, and indentation for SQL formatting purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from sqlfmt.comment, sqlfmt.node, and sqlfmt.tokens modules, and the class methods that process Nodes and Comments.",
  "sinks": "Methods that generate string representations of lines, particularly render_with_comments, which concatenates comments and code.",
  "flows": "Input data from Nodes and Comments (sources) flows into rendering methods, producing formatted string output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. No external data leakage or suspicious input handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides data structures for line management in SQL formatting, with numerous properties for line characteristics and formatting rules. It uses standard Python features (dataclasses, list comprehensions). No network operations, file handling, or sensitive data processing are present. The code does not include any dynamic execution, obfuscated patterns, or hidden behaviors. All logic is related to formatting and line structure management, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for SQL code formatting, with no malicious intent or security risks. It relies on standard Python modules and practices, and there are no signs of malware or suspicious behavior.",
