  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their reasoning, and determine the appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a data structure for representing and formatting SQL lines, with no suspicious or malicious patterns. It reads from Nodes and Comments, constructs strings for output, and manages indentation and syntax elements like brackets and Jinja blocks.\n\n- **Assessment**: The reasoning is sound. No evidence of external data flows, code injection, network activity, or obfuscated code. The logic is straightforward and aligns with a SQL formatter component.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n  - Obfuscated: **0** — code is clear and well-structured.\n  - Security Risk: **0** — no vulnerabilities or risky operations.\n\n**Verdict**: The report's scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the benign nature of the code. No external data flows, no dynamic execution, no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Assessment**: Correct. The code is a standard utility for formatting SQL code, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: **0**\n  - Obfuscated: **0**\n  - Security Risk: **0**\n\n**Verdict**: The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, the code is a standard SQL formatting utility. No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious constructs.\n\n- **Assessment**: Accurate. The code is purely for internal formatting, with no external interactions.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: **0**\n  - Obfuscated: **0**\n  - Security Risk: **0**\n\n**Verdict**: Reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is for SQL formatting, with detailed properties for managing syntax elements. It uses standard practices and no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Assessment**: Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) noted, but given the code's nature, this is probably an overestimation. No external data handling or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: **0**\n  - Obfuscated: **0**\n  - Security Risk: **0.1** — perhaps slightly high; the code is safe but a minimal risk score might be justified if considering potential future extensions, but currently, it's low.\n\n**Verdict**: The malware score remains at 0; the security risk score could be adjusted to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to others, standard SQL formatting code with no malicious patterns.\n\n- **Assessment**: Correct. No external data flows, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: **0**\n  - Obfuscated: **0**\n  - Security Risk: **0**\n\n**Verdict**: The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n- The only minor inconsistency is Report 4 assigning a small security risk score (0.1), which isn't justified given the code's functionality.\n\n### **Final Estimations**\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — no security vulnerabilities or risky operations.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The code is a standard, well-structured part of a SQL formatter with no malicious or security concerns. The scores across reports are consistent with this assessment, with a slight note that the minimal security risk score in Report 4 could be adjusted to zero for consistency.",
