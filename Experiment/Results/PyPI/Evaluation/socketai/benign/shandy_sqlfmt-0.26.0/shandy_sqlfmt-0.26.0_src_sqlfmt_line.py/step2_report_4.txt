  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: code presence, potential issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a data structure for representing lines in a SQL formatter, with no external or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is purely about formatting, with no data sinks or external interactions. The malware score is correctly set to 0.\n- **Score justification:** Low risk, benign code, no anomalies.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep malware at 0, security risk at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a class managing SQL line formatting, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. No dynamic code, no external data flows, no obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Malware remains at 0, security risk at 0.\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a class for SQL line formatting, with standard data handling.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior. The code is a straightforward formatter.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score remains 0; security risk is very low.\n- **Recommendation:** No change.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar content, with the note that the overall security risk is 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score, but the reasoning states no malicious activity, just standard formatting.\n- **Score justification:** The 0.1 security risk seems to be a conservative buffer; the code is benign.\n- **Recommendation:** The malware score remains 0; the security risk score of 0.1 is acceptable given the context but could be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a benign SQL formatter class, no external actions.\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The confidence is high.\n- **Score justification:** Malware at 0, security risk at 0.\n- **Recommendation:** No change.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary and My Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, mostly 0, with one at 0.1, which is acceptable given the benign nature.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\nGiven the consistent benign nature of the code across all reports, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, readable code)\n- **Security risk:** **0** (no external data, no network, no system modifications)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward, safe implementation of a SQL line formatter, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.  \n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments necessary.  \n- The overall security posture of this code is very low risk.",
