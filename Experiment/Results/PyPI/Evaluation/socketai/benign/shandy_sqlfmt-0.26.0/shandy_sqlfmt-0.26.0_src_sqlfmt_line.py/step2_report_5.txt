  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a data structure for representing and formatting SQL lines, involving Nodes and Comments.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks or data flows that could be malicious.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears benign, serving as part of a SQL formatter. No signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. The confidence is high (1).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code content. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly identifies the code as a line representation for formatting.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard formatting utility with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.9 (slightly high but justified given the formatting context). The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), but still high.\n\n**Assessment:** The high security risk score might be slightly conservative but acceptable, considering the code handles formatting logic without external effects.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the code's role in SQL formatting.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious actions.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, standard code for formatting with no malware signs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. The confidence is high (1).\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; focuses on SQL formatting.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected; straightforward formatting code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 (very low). Confidence is perfect (1).\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate; the minimal security risk score aligns with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a SQL formatting component.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe implementation for formatting SQL lines.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. The confidence is high (0.95).\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. I agree with the malware scores of 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Most reports assign very low or zero risk scores, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose and lack of external effects, I would assign a **risk score of 0** or at most **0.1** if considering minimal formatting-related risks (which are negligible).\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately conservative. The code is a standard, safe implementation of a SQL line formatter with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0 (or 0.1 for conservative estimation)",
