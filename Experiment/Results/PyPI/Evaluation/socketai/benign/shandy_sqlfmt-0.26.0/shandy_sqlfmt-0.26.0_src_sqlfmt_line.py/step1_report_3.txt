{
  "purpose": "The code defines a data structure for representing and formatting lines of SQL code, including handling comments, brackets, and Jinja blocks for SQL formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules (sqlfmt.comment, sqlfmt.node, sqlfmt.tokens), class attributes, method parameters, and properties that access node and comment data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks that could leak untrusted input or perform malicious actions. It primarily constructs string representations of SQL lines.",
  "flows": "Input data from Nodes and Comments flows through string rendering methods, but there are no untrusted data flows to external systems or network communications.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of a SQL formatting class. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. No code injection, data exfiltration, or network activity is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a data structure for representing formatted SQL lines with methods for rendering, indentation, and comment integration. It utilizes safe programming patterns, such as property accessors and class methods, without external data manipulation or unsafe operations. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network access, or data exfiltration, are present. The code's purpose is to format SQL code and comments for pretty-printing, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard implementation of a SQL formatter's line representation. It does not contain malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The overall security risk is very low.",
