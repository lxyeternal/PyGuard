  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the correctness of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and any potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a data structure for representing and rendering lines of SQL code, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward formatter component. No external data flows, no network or file operations, and no obfuscated or malicious code are present. The malware and security risk scores are appropriately set to zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a standard SQL formatting utility with no external or malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code's structure. The scores are reasonable, given the absence of any suspicious patterns or external interactions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a benign SQL formatter component, with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is consistent with the code's content. No external data handling or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SQL formatting class, with no signs of malicious behavior, but assigns a small security risk score of 0.1.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nWhile the code is indeed benign, the small security risk score might reflect a cautious stance, perhaps considering that formatting code could be involved in templating or code injection contexts. However, since the code itself does not perform any such operations, this risk score seems slightly overcautious but still acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous assessments, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code's nature. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The code does not contain any malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Not explicitly given, but implied to be 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, which is acceptable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security Risk:** 0 (no security vulnerabilities or external threats)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured implementation of a line representation for a SQL formatter. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe and does not pose security risks.",
