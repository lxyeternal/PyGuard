  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling and control flow in a SQL formatting tool.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions; no external data or input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; static class definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class definitions with clear documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for internal error handling and control flow management. It inherits from standard Python exceptions and includes descriptive docstrings. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, data leaks, or external data handling. The code is static, with no dynamic execution or network activity. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, which is appropriate given the benign and standard nature of the code. The analysis across multiple reports confirms the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent, and the scores are consistent with the code's purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception classes used internally within a SQL formatting tool. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are accurate and justified.",
