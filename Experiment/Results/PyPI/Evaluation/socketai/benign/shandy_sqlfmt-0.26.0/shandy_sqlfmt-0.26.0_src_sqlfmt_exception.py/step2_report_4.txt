  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\nAll five reports confirm that the code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for a SQL formatting tool. They emphasize that:\n- No data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- The classes inherit from standard exceptions and serve error handling and control flow purposes.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated patterns are present.\n- The code appears standard, benign, and safe.\n\n**Confirmations & Validations:**\n- The code matches the descriptions: no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The purpose is internal error categorization, with no external data handling.\n- The class hierarchy and comments are consistent with typical exception definitions.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- No issues with the scores assigned: all indicate zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- Malware score: 0 — no malicious behavior or payloads.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 — no obfuscation.\n- Risk score: 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n- Confidence: 1 — all reports agree.\n\n**Challenging Assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly assume the code is benign. No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are unfounded.\n- The class definitions do not process untrusted data, nor do they contain hidden payloads.\n\n**Consistency Checks:**\n- The scores align with the code's nature.\n- No inconsistencies or unreasonable scores are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the scoring reflects this correctly.",
