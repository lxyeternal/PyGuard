{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various error and control flow scenarios in a SQL formatting tool.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance, standard exception raising methods, string representations.",
  "sinks": "Potentially error handling and control flow management, but no untrusted data sources or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "Error and control flow exceptions are raised and caught within the application, no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from standard Python exceptions. These are used for error handling and control flow within a SQL formatting tool. There are no data inputs, external connections, or malicious behaviors. The code structure and comments suggest standard exception management practices. No indications of malicious intent or suspicious activity are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for internal error and control flow management in a Python project. It does not contain malware, suspicious patterns, or security risks.",
