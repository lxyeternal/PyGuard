  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a SQL formatting tool.",
  "sources": "None of the classes read external input; they only define error types.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within these class definitions; they are merely error type declarations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard exception class definitions with no signs of suspicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in exceptions. Each class is well-documented, indicating specific error conditions related to SQL formatting. There are no indications of code injection, malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The classes are straightforward, with no dynamic execution or hidden payloads. Overall, this code serves as a standard error handling module with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard exception class definitions for error handling in a SQL formatting tool. It poses no security risks or malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
