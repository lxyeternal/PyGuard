  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling and control flow in a SQL formatting tool.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance from standard Python exceptions; no external input or data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sink points for untrusted data or external effects; no functions or I/O operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only defines exception classes without any runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling within a SQL formatting utility. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. The exception classes inherit from standard Python exceptions and serve to categorize errors, control flow, or signal specific issues during parsing, lexing, merging, or configuration. No suspicious or malicious code, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard and benign set of exception class definitions intended for internal error handling within a SQL formatting tool. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
