  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a SQL formatting tool.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception inheritance structures.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, external input, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; code only defines exception classes without data flow or logic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns identified; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SQL formatting errors and control flow management. No data input, output, or external interactions are present. Exception classes inherit from standard Python exception types and add descriptive docstrings. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The structure appears clean, with no unusual language features or obfuscation. The purpose is clearly to handle errors in a SQL formatting context without executing or processing untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions intended for error handling within a SQL formatting library. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured, and safe.",
