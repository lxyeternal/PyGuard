  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - There are no indications of malicious code, data processing, or external input handling.\n   - The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flow, external interactions, or potential vulnerabilities.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are also 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - These scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions for exceptions, there is no reason to assign a higher risk.\n   - The risk scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - No malicious behavior, payloads, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions about malicious intent; they focus on the code's benign nature.\n   - The reasoning is sound and cautious.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are observed.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n- The code is a standard, well-documented set of exception classes.\n- It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.\n\n**My Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions for internal error handling in a SQL formatting tool. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
