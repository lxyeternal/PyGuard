  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines multiple custom exception classes for error handling and control flow within a SQL formatting tool.\n   - All classes inherit from standard Python exceptions (`ValueError`, `Exception`, or a custom control flow exception).\n   - The classes are well-documented, with clear purpose descriptions.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is static, solely defining exception types.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks**:\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n   - No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n   - No external data handling or network activity.\n   - The purpose is purely internal error categorization and control flow management.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — given the above, there's no security risk.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Logical Errors**:\n   - The code is purely declarative; no runtime logic or data processing.\n   - No issues with the class hierarchy or documentation.\n   - The exception classes are standard practice for error handling; no flaws identified.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk.\n   - This is appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - The code does not perform any untrusted data handling or external interactions.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here; the code is standard exception class definitions.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of custom exception classes for internal error handling.\n- No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions. The code is benign and poses no security concerns.",
