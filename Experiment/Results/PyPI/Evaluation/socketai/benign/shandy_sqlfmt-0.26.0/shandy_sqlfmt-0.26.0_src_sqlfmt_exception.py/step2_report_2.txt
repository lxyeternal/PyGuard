  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code only defines custom exception classes for error handling and control flow in a SQL formatting tool.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or any other behavior that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n   - The classes inherit from standard Python exceptions, with descriptive docstrings, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports consistently state that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard for error handling.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident; the analysis aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.\n   - These scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No issues warrant a risk score higher than 0.5; the code is purely class definitions with no malicious or risky behavior.\n   - The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain hidden payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unfounded assumptions; they recognize the code as standard exception class definitions.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed or implied.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n   - The high confidence and zero risk/malware scores are appropriate.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, well-documented set of exception classes used for internal error handling in a SQL formatting tool.\n- There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The reports' conclusions and scores are accurate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk present)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code appears to be a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions for internal use. No further security concerns are warranted.",
