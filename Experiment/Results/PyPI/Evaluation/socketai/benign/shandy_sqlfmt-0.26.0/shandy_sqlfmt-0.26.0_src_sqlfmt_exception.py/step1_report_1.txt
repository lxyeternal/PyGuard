  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling and control flow in a SQL formatting tool.",
  "sources": "None (no input reading, only class definitions and exception declarations).",
  "targets": "None (no untrusted data or outputs involved).",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception classes inheriting from standard exceptions like ValueError and Exception. The classes are used for error handling within a SQL formatting application. There are no data input/output, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for internal error handling. It shows no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks.",
