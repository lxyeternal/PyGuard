  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for error handling and control flow in a SQL formatting tool. The classes inherit from standard exceptions like `ValueError` and `Exception`, with clear docstrings explaining their purpose. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution involved.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Activity or Obfuscation**:  \n   All reports consistently note the absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The code appears straightforward, intended solely for internal error categorization.\n\n3. **Error & Security Risks**:  \n   Given that the code only defines exception classes, there are no evident security risks, data leaks, or vulnerabilities. The absence of external data handling or network operations further reduces any potential attack surface.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. There is no indication of malicious code or payloads.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, correctly reflecting the clear, un-obfuscated nature of the code.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Any Logical or Reasoning Flaws?**  \n   No. The reports correctly interpret the code's purpose and scope. They recognize it as standard exception class definitions with no security concerns.\n\n6. **Potential for Changes in Scores**:  \n   Since the code is purely structural and does not process data or perform actions, raising the risk, malware, or obfuscated scores would be unwarranted.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions.\n- No malicious intent, malware, or obfuscation is present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and should remain unchanged.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious behavior.",
