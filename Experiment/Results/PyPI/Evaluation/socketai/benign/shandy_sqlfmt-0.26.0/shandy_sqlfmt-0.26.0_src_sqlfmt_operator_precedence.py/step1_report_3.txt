{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration and functions to determine operator precedence for SQL parsing and evaluation.",
  "sources": "None of the code directly reads external input; it relies on Node objects and token types provided during execution.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; primarily static mapping based on Node attributes and token types.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex patterns to match operator strings is standard; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. No unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of operator precedence handling for SQL parsing, with static mappings and regex pattern matching for specific operators. It relies on Node objects with predictable attributes. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The use of regex for pattern matching is typical for such parsers. Overall, the code performs static mapping and categorization without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for SQL operator precedence mapping with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
