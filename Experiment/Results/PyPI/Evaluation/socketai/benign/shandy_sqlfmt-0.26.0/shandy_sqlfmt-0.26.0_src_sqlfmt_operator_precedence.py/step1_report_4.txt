{
  "purpose": "This code defines an enumeration for operator precedence in SQL parsing and includes methods for mapping tokens and nodes to precedence levels, primarily for SQL syntax analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'sqlfmt.node' and 'sqlfmt.tokens' modules, particularly Node and TokenType classes; data reading occurs in 'node' objects and their 'type' and 'value' attributes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no data outputs, external network communication, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input data from Node objects and token types flow through mapping functions to determine operator precedence; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex patterns for pattern matching on node values is standard; no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code detected. The code appears straightforward and adheres to expected design for operator precedence handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes an enum for operator precedence and maps tokens and node values to these levels. It uses regex for pattern matching operator words and patterns, which is typical for SQL parsing. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation is present. The module relies on external modules for 'Node' and 'TokenType', but their use here is limited to safe pattern matching and classification. The code does not perform any I/O, system calls, or cryptography that could be malicious. Overall, the implementation is standard, well-structured, and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard utility module for SQL operator precedence classification, with no evidence of malicious intent, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior. It functions as a safe component for SQL parsing logic.",
