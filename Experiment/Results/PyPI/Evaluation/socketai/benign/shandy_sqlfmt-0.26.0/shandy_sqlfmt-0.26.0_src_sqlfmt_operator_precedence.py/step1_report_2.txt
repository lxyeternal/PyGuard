{
  "purpose": "The code defines an enumeration for operator precedence and methods to determine precedence based on nodes, likely for a SQL formatter or parser.",
  "sources": "No explicit external data sources or inputs; static definitions and internal method calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform dangerous actions; the code primarily maps tokens and node values to precedence levels.",
  "flows": "Method calls to map node tokens and values to precedence levels, with pattern matching on node values.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses regex pattern matching on node values for specific SQL operators, which is normal for such parsing tasks; no suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. No external network or system calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an enumeration for operator precedence and provides methods to determine precedence levels based on node tokens or values. It includes pattern matching with regex for specific SQL operator keywords. The structure appears typical for a parser component, and there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors. All functions are purely data-driven and do not execute untrusted code or external commands. There are no suspicious or obfuscated parts of the code; the regex patterns are straightforward for SQL keyword matching.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard part of a SQL parser or formatter, mapping tokens to precedence levels. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. It is a safe and typical implementation for such a component.",
