  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines an enum for SQL operator precedence, with functions to categorize nodes based on token types and values, including regex matching for word operators.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no external network or file operations. The regex patterns are straightforward for matching SQL keywords.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, as it’s a utility module.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard parser component.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on mapping tokens to precedence levels, with regex matching for specific SQL operators.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior; regex patterns are simple and intended for classification.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, benign code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on operator precedence mapping, relies on Node objects, no external or dangerous operations.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no network or system calls.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, typical parser logic.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, categorizes SQL operators with regex matching.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; relies on external modules but uses them safely.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Classifies operators, uses regex on node.value, which could be from untrusted sources.\n- **Assessment:** The only potential concern is that node.value might be untrusted input. However, regex matching here is only for classification, not execution or injection.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher at 0.2 due to untrusted input consideration, but no actual malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, standard pattern matching for classification.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe code that maps SQL tokens and node values to operator precedence levels, using enums and regex pattern matching.\n- **Malicious Activity:** None detected. No code injection, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** Minimal, mostly related to handling untrusted input in node.value, but regex matching alone is not dangerous here.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate. The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The code is a standard utility for SQL parsing, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n- The only minor concern is that node.value could be untrusted, but the code only performs regex matching, which is safe in this context.\n- The overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at **0**.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, since no real risk exists)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, well-structured, and appropriate for its purpose. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.",
