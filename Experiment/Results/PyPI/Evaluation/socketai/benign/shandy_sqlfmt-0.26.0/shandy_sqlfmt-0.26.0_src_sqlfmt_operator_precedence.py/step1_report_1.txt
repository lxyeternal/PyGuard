{
  "purpose": "The code defines an enumeration for operator precedence in SQL-like expressions and includes functions to categorize nodes based on their operator type for parsing or evaluation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'node' object (node.is_operator, node.token.type, node.value, node.is_the_and_after_the_between_operator) and the imported modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks where untrusted data is used insecurely or data leaks occur; the code mainly processes tokens and categorizes them.",
  "flows": "The functions process nodes based on their token type and value, mapping these to operator precedence levels. The flow involves reading node attributes, pattern matching via regex, and returning enum values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The regex patterns are straightforward for pattern matching, with no obfuscated or suspicious logic. The code does not perform any network operations or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides a categorization framework for operators in SQL expressions, including regex-based pattern matching for word operators. It relies on standard library modules and appears well-structured. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. No external side-effects or insecure practices are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a legitimate utility for categorizing SQL operators and contains no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It appears safe for use, with no security risks detected based on the provided code.",
