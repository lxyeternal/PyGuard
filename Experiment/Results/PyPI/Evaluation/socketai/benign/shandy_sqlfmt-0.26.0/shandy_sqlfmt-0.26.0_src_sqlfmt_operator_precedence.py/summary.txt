  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for categorizing SQL operators based on token types and values. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal concern about untrusted input does not translate into actual malicious behavior, and the code remains safe for use."
