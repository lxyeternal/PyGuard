{
  "purpose": "Categorizes SQL operators and their precedence levels based on node attributes and token types, primarily for parsing or formatting SQL statements.",
  "sources": "Reads from node attributes such as is_operator, value, and token.type; uses regex patterns to match specific SQL keywords and operators.",
  "sinks": "No insecure data handling or external system interactions; pattern matching is limited to classification purposes.",
  "flows": "Node attributes and token types serve as sources; regex pattern matching and enum mapping serve as sinks; flow is from node data to precedence categorization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns or obfuscation; regex matching on node.value could be misused if node.value is untrusted, but only for classification, not execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enum for operator precedence and functions to determine precedence based on node attributes and token types. Regex patterns are used for matching specific SQL keywords and operators. The logic is static, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The reliance on node.value for regex matching is a potential surface for misuse if node.value is untrusted, but in the context of a parser, this is standard and safe. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code is a typical utility component in SQL parsing or formatting tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for categorizing SQL operators based on token types and values. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal concern about untrusted input does not translate into actual malicious behavior, and the code remains safe for use.",
