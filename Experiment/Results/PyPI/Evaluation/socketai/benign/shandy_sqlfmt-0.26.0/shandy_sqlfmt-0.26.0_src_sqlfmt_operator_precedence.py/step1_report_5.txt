{
  "purpose": "This code defines an enumeration and associated methods for handling SQL operator precedence and categorization, including parsing operators from nodes and patterns.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'node' objects, specifically node.token.type and node.value, as well as pattern matching on node.value.",
  "sinks": "Uses pattern matching on node.value for regex comparison, which could potentially lead to processing untrusted input if node.value is externally supplied.",
  "flows": "Source: node.token.type or node.value -> Pattern matching or lookup functions -> Determination of operator precedence or category.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs regex matching on node.value without sanitization, but only for pattern classification; no direct execution or data leakage observed. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a classification system for SQL operators based on token type and value, utilizing regex patterns and lookups. It relies on external node objects which could originate from untrusted sources, but the logic itself only performs pattern matching and enum assignments. No malicious data handling, code injection, or external communications are present. The use of regex is safe in this context as it only matches patterns for categorization, not executing code. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for categorizing SQL operators based on token types and values. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. It appears to be part of a parser or formatter module. The risk of malicious behavior is very low.",
