  "purpose": "The code provides functions to convert various file formats (JSON, CSV, NPY, NPZ) into NumPy arrays or sparse matrices for use in inference pipelines.",
  "sources": "Input data streams or strings provided to decoding functions, including JSON strings, CSV strings, NPY byte arrays, and NPZ byte arrays.",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions that process input data into NumPy arrays or sparse matrices, which could be used downstream for model inference.",
  "flows": "Input data (JSON/CSV/NPY/NPZ) -> Decoders -> Conversion to NumPy arrays or sparse matrices",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard libraries and does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual logic. No external network or system calls are present. The functions perform straightforward data conversions without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The module performs data deserialization and conversion tasks common in data processing workflows for machine learning. It uses json.loads for JSON parsing, numpy functions for CSV and NPY data, and scipy for NPZ sparse matrices. All functions rely on standard, well-known libraries. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as network activity, system modification, or obfuscation, are detected. The decode function maps content types to appropriate decoders and raises an exception for unsupported formats. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data decoding utility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard data processing libraries to convert input data into NumPy arrays or sparse matrices for inference purposes. There are no indications of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors.",
