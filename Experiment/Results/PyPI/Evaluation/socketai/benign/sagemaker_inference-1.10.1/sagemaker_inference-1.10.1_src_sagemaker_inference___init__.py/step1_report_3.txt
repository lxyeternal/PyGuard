  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided in the snippet; further context is needed to determine its intent.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include any data input methods, environment variable reads, or external file reads present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are places where data could be sent over the network, written to files, or executed as code, though no such actions are explicitly visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flow analysis cannot be completed definitively without seeing specific source and sink points; the code appears minimal or incomplete.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are observed in the provided snippet. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is either empty or too minimal to conduct an effective review. No input sources, data processing, or output sinks are evident. Without additional code, it is not possible to identify malicious behavior or security risks. The lack of context makes it difficult to assess intent or risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no indications of malicious behavior, anomalies, or security issues. The code appears benign or incomplete. Additional context or the full codebase would be necessary for a comprehensive review.",
