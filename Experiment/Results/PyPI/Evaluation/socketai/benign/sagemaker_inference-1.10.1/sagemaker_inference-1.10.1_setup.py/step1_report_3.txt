{
  "purpose": "This script is used to configure the setup and installation of the sagemaker_inference Python package, specifying dependencies, package data, metadata, and other installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'VERSION' and 'README.md' files, collecting Python modules in 'src', and gathering required packages for installation.",
  "sinks": "Executing 'setuptools.setup' to initiate package installation, indirectly calling functions like 'read' which open files; no untrusted data inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "File reading (VERSION, README.md) -> setup configuration -> package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and adheres to standard setup script practices. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The 'read' function uses 'open' without explicit security measures, but it's standard for setup scripts and involves no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for packaging and reads version and description files. It defines required dependencies with conditional inclusion for older Python versions. The 'setuptools.setup' call includes typical package metadata and configuration for distribution. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, no dynamic code execution, or external network activity. The code is standard and appears secure, with no anomalies or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard, benign package configuration for a Python project. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It follows conventional practices for Python package setup without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
