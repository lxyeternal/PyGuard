{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package for distribution, defining dependencies, package data, and metadata for the sagemaker_inference toolkit.",
  "sources": "The code reads files 'VERSION' and 'README.md'; accesses the filesystem for package discovery and data; checks Python version; and uses environment variables for versioning.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include reading files (VERSION, README.md), installing dependencies, and executing setup functions.",
  "flows": "Source to sink flow involves reading version info and README, determining dependencies, and passing parameters to setuptools.setup for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code primarily performs standard setup tasks. The import of sys and dynamic package discovery is typical. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python project. It reads version and description files, specifies dependencies including conditional requirements for Python versions below 3.4, and defines package metadata and data. The use of os.path and glob for file operations, along with setuptools for packaging, is typical. No malicious or suspicious behavior, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code execution, is present. The code appears to be legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It follows typical packaging practices without any anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
