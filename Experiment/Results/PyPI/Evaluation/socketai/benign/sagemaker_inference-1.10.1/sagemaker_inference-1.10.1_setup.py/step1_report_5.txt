{
  "purpose": "This code sets up the packaging configuration for the 'sagemaker_inference' Python package, defining dependencies, package data, metadata, and installation requirements.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from the 'VERSION' file, reading README.md, reading files from the 'src' directory, and obtaining environment variables via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The setup script does not perform network operations, data processing, or system modifications beyond package configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script only reads static files and environment info for setup purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. The script follows standard Python packaging patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package setup and dependency management. It reads version info and description files, determines required packages based on Python version, and configures package metadata. There are no obfuscated segments or dynamic code execution. All operations are typical for a setup.py file. No signs of malicious intent, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden payloads, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package without any malicious behavior. It performs standard package configuration tasks with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
