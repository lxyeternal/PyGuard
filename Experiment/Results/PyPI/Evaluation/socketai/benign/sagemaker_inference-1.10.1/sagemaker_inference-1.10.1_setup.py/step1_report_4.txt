{
  "purpose": "This script sets up and configures a Python package called 'sagemaker_inference' for distribution, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'VERSION' file, reading 'README.md', and reading files from the filesystem (e.g., via glob and open).",
  "sinks": "Package setup functions, file operations, and package data inclusion do not process untrusted data or pose security risks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading files ('VERSION' and 'README.md') into setup configuration; no untrusted input or malicious data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks using setuptools, including reading version info and dependencies. It carefully reads files from the filesystem without executing untrusted code or handling user input. The only file operations are reading static files for package info, which are safe. The code also includes a version check to conditionally add a dependency, which is standard. No suspicious or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate open-source setup configuration for a SageMaker inference toolkit package.",
