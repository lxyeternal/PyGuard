  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the sagemaker_inference Python project, configuring metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads 'VERSION' file for version info, 'README.md' for long description, and package files via setuptools functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only static file reads and package configuration operations.",
  "flows": "Reads version and description files, then passes configuration parameters to setuptools.setup() without dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup.py script for Python packaging. It reads static files for versioning and description, configures package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or untrusted data handling. The use of open() without additional security measures is standard in such scripts. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The dependency management based on Python version is a common practice. Overall, the script is benign and follows best practices for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup.py script with no malicious intent or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (0.1), reflecting the minimal inherent risk of package configuration scripts.",
