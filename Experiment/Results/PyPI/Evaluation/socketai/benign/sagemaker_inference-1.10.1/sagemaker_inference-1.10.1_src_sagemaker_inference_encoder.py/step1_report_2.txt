{
  "purpose": "The module provides functions to convert array-like objects into JSON, NPY, and CSV formats for inference in SageMaker.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from array-like objects passed to the functions (_array_to_json, _array_to_npy, _array_to_csv).",
  "sinks": "The code converts data to JSON strings, NPY binary data, and CSV strings. These outputs could potentially be misused if fed into insecure downstream systems.",
  "flows": "Input data is received via function parameters, processed by encoder functions, and output as JSON strings, binary NPY data, or CSV strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The use of 'json.dumps', 'np.save', and 'np.savetxt' is standard. The default function in '_array_to_json' handles custom objects safely. No obfuscated code or unusual control flows are present.",
  "analysis": "The code offers standard data serialization functions for array-like objects, utilizing numpy and json libraries. It includes a mapping from content types to encoder functions, with proper error handling for unsupported formats. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage. The code is straightforward and focuses solely on data serialization, with no external network communication, credential handling, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for data serialization with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for converting data formats without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
