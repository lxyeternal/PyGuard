{
  "purpose": "The module provides functions for converting array-like objects into various formats such as JSON, NPY, and CSV, primarily for data serialization and encoding.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via function parameters, specifically 'array_like' and 'content_type' in the 'encode' function.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include 'json.dumps', 'np.save', and 'np.savetxt', which output serialized data. No direct data leakage or unsafe code appears evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'array_like' is processed through specific encoder functions (_array_to_json, _array_to_npy, _array_to_csv), which then produce serialized data. The 'encode' function routes data to the appropriate encoder based on 'content_type'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be standard serialization routines with well-defined data flow.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common libraries (json, numpy, six) and uses standard data serialization methods. It has no external inputs from untrusted sources such as user inputs or environment variables. The functions perform data serialization without executing untrusted code or external commands. Error handling is limited to raising an exception if the content type is unsupported, which is safe. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The code performs straightforward data encoding with no suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data serialization module with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It handles data conversion securely without executing untrusted code or leaking sensitive data.",
