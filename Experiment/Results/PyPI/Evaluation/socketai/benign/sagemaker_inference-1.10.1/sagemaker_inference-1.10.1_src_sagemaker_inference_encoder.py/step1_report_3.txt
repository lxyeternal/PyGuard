{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for converting array-like objects into various data formats such as JSON, NPY, and CSV, primarily for use in inference workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters in functions such as _array_to_json, _array_to_npy, _array_to_csv, and encode.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include json.dumps, np.save, np.savetxt, and return statements which output data in different formats; however, these are standard serialization functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (array_like, content_type) through format-specific encoder functions, then serialized and returned as byte strings or JSON strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or malicious network activity. Usage of numpy's save/load and JSON serialization are standard data processing steps.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and sagemaker_inference components, performs data serialization in supported formats, and raises exceptions for unsupported content types. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious logic observed. The functions serve straightforward data transformation purposes without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data serialization utility module with no malicious intent. It handles data encoding for inference pipelines securely and without evidence of sabotage or malware.",
