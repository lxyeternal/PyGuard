{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to convert array-like objects to JSON, NPY, and CSV formats, and encodes them based on content type.",
  "sources": "Imports of json, numpy, six modules, and local content_types and errors modules; no external input sources or untrusted data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "Data serialization functions (json.dumps, np.save, np.savetxt) that output data in different formats; no network or file system writing beyond standard serialization.",
  "flows": "Array-like input flows into encoding functions, which select appropriate encoders, resulting in serialized data outputs; no untrusted data flows into system-critical operations or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors; the code performs standard data serialization with proper exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions for converting array-like objects into JSON, NPY, and CSV formats, with a mapping for content types to encoder functions. It includes input validation through exception handling when an unsupported format is requested. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity is evident. All functions operate within safe boundaries, using established libraries and methods for data serialization. The code appears to be part of a larger framework for model inference, and it does not execute any external commands, network requests, or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data serialization utility module with no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It performs expected operations safely and securely.",
