  "purpose": "Provides functions to serialize array-like objects into JSON, NPY, and CSV formats for use in inference workflows.",
  "sources": "Function inputs: array_like parameter in serialization functions.",
  "sinks": "In-memory buffers (json.dumps, BytesIO, StringIO) returning serialized data; no external sinks.",
  "flows": "Input array-like data flows into encoder functions, which serialize into strings or binary data, returned to caller.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data serialization using well-known libraries. It converts array-like objects into JSON strings, binary NPY format, or CSV strings, with appropriate error handling for unsupported formats. No network activity, code injection, or malicious patterns are evident. The functions operate solely in-memory, and the code structure is straightforward and readable. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior detected. The security implications are minimal; potential downstream misuse of serialized data is a general concern but not a vulnerability within this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented serialization utility with no malicious intent or security flaws. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (~0.1), which are justified as potential downstream concerns but not actual vulnerabilities.",
