  "purpose": "Define MIME content type constants for use in a Python module, likely related to data processing or web communication.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains constant definitions and comments, with no input reading or external data access.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written, output, or processed in a way that could leak or affect external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists beyond assigning string values to constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of licensing comments, documentation string, and definitions of MIME type constants. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. The structure is simple and typical for defining constants. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily serving as a set of constants for MIME types. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues.",
