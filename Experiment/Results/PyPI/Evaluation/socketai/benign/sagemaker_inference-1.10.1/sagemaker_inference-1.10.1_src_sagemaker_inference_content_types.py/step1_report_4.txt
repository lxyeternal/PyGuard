{
  "purpose": "Define constants for MIME content types used in a Python module, likely for handling data serialization formats.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read; the code only defines constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or processing of untrusted data are present; no data leaks or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks since the code only contains static constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior are present in this code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of string constants representing MIME types, with licensing information included. There are no functions, input handling, or dynamic code execution. The license comment does not contain any embedded code or URLs that suggest malicious intent. The constants are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard constants module defining MIME types with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
