  "purpose": "Define constants for MIME content types used in data handling and communication.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources; the code is a static declaration of constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, output, or data leak points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no hidden or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only constant string definitions for various MIME types, including JSON, CSV, binary streams, and numpy formats. It includes a license header, indicating open-source use, and no data processing or external interactions are present. The code appears to be part of a larger module for data handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of constant definitions for MIME types with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, open-source utility module.",
