  "purpose": "Define constants for various MIME content types used in the module",
  "sources": "No external input sources; constants are hardcoded strings",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process or output untrusted data; purely defining constants",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; static constant definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of constant definitions and licensing comments",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing information and static definitions of MIME types as string constants. There are no functions, input handling, or dynamic operations. No signs of data processing, user input, or external data interaction. The license header indicates legal usage rights but no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The simplicity and static nature of this code imply low risk.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, straightforward definition of MIME type constants with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves a standard purpose within a larger project.",
