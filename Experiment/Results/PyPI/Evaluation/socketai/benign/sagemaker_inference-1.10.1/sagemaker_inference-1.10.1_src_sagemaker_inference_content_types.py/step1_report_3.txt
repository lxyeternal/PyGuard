  "purpose": "Define constants for MIME content types, possibly for use in data handling or communication protocols.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data sources; only static constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data is processed or sent to untrusted destinations.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code only assigns string constants to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward constant definition with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of licensing information followed by a set of string constants defining MIME types. There is no dynamic or executable code, no input handling, and no data processing. It appears to be a simple constants module intended for specifying MIME types, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign constants module defining MIME content types with no malicious intent or security issues. It serves as a utility module for MIME type references and does not pose any security risks.",
