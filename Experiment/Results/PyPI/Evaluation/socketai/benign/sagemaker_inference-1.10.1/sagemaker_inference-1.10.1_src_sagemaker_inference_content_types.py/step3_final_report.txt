  "purpose": "Defines MIME content type constants for use in other modules or applications.",
  "sources": "No data input; static constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static constants without data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only string constants representing MIME types, with a license header. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these scores. No suspicious patterns, hidden code, or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility module defining MIME type constants. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores and assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
