  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple constant definitions for MIME types.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are involved.\n- No functions, dynamic code, or input handling are present.\n- All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- The license headers are standard and do not contain suspicious URLs or embedded code.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n**Issue presence:**  \n- The code is straightforward constant definitions. There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors present.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n- The reports are accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign and static.\n\n**Scores review:**  \n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty, which seems justified.\n\n**Risk and malware scores justification:**  \n- Since the code only defines constants with no dynamic or executable content, the risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- Malware score of 0 is justified because there's no malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated score of 0 is justified due to the code's simplicity and clarity.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**  \n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made; the code is evidently benign.\n- The license header is standard and does not imply any hidden malicious code.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**  \n- All scores are consistent with the code's static, benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign constants module defining MIME types, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound.",
