{
  "purpose": "This code provides a base class for handling inference in a machine learning deployment, with methods to load models, process inputs, generate predictions, and format outputs.",
  "sources": "Reads input data in default_input_fn, potentially reads accept headers in default_output_fn, imports from sagemaker_inference and utils.",
  "sinks": "Returns encoded prediction data in default_output_fn, raises NotImplementedError in default_model_fn and default_predict_fn.",
  "flows": "Input data is decoded in default_input_fn, used in predict_fn (not implemented), and output is encoded in default_output_fn.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; code is a standard abstract base class with placeholder methods.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward base class implementation for inference handling, with abstract methods to be implemented by subclasses. It uses standard libraries and sagemaker_inference modules. No hardcoded credentials, data leakage, or malicious behavior are present. The functions raise NotImplementedError where necessary, indicating it's meant to be extended. No unsafe code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious base class for inference handling, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It functions as an abstract framework for model deployment.",
