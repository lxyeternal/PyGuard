  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a standard inference handler template; no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The code raises NotImplementedError for core functions, as intended.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.9 seems high; since no malicious activity is detected, a score of 0.1 or 0 would be more appropriate.\n- **Justification for high risk score:** No evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The high score appears unjustified.\n- **Overall:** The report is accurate; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, a standard skeleton class with no malicious code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1. This seems reasonable, given the code's benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, just a framework.\n- **Overall:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Again, a straightforward base class with no suspicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. The assessment aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, no malicious or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. This is appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same benign template.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a benign, boilerplate implementation.\n- The main concern is the high malware and risk scores in Report 1, which are unjustified given the code content.\n- The code does not contain any obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** Should be low, around 0.1 or 0, since the code is a benign template with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code is a standard, safe template for SageMaker inference handlers, with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
