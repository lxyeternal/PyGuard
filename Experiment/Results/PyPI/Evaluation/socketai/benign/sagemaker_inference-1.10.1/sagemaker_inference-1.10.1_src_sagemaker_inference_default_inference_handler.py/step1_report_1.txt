{
  "purpose": "This module defines a basic inference handler class for SageMaker, providing default functions for model loading, input decoding, prediction, and output encoding.",
  "sources": "Imports from sagemaker_inference (decoder, encoder, errors, utils), class definition, and method implementations that utilize these imported functions.",
  "sinks": "Calls to decoder.decode() for input processing, encoder.encode() for output serialization, and errors.UnsupportedFormatError for unsupported content types.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed via decoder.decode() in default_input_fn, and prediction results are serialized via encoder.encode() in default_output_fn. Errors are raised if format is unsupported.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. Methods raise NotImplementedError as intended for extensibility, and no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a template for inference handling in SageMaker, with methods to be implemented by the user. It relies on external sagemaker_inference utilities for decoding and encoding. No sensitive data handling, network connections, or code injection points are present. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to be standard, boilerplate implementation of a handler interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious template for a SageMaker inference handler. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It primarily acts as a framework for user-implemented functions.",
