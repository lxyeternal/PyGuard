{
  "purpose": "Define a base class for handling inference tasks in a machine learning deployment, including model loading, input decoding, prediction, and output encoding.",
  "sources": "Imports from sagemaker_inference library, standard Python modules, and class method parameters (model_dir, input_data, content_type, etc.)",
  "sinks": "Return statements in default_output_fn that encode and return prediction data, raising exceptions for unsupported formats.",
  "flows": "Input data is decoded via decoder.decode in default_input_fn, processed through predict_fn (to be implemented), then serialized via encoder.encode in default_output_fn.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard library functions, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal base class with abstract methods for model loading and prediction, and implemented methods for data decoding and encoding. It relies on external libraries for decoding and encoding, and raises appropriate exceptions for unsupported formats. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present; the code appears to serve as a standard template for inference handlers.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious template for inference handling in SageMaker. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It solely defines a base class with expected functionality.",
