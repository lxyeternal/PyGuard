  "purpose": "Define a base class for default inference handling in a SageMaker environment, including methods for model loading, input decoding, prediction, and output encoding.",
  "sources": "Imports from sagemaker_inference (decoder, encoder, errors, utils), class methods that receive input data and parameters.",
  "sinks": "Decoding input data (decoder.decode), encoding output data (encoder.encode), raising errors (errors.UnsupportedFormatError).",
  "flows": "Input data is decoded via decoder.decode; prediction is performed (to be implemented); output data is encoded via encoder.encode; unsupported content types trigger errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. All methods are placeholders or straightforward data handling functions. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base class with methods to load models, process inputs, perform predictions, and produce outputs. The methods mainly call external modules for decoding and encoding, and raise NotImplementedError for key functions. There are no direct data manipulations, external system calls, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a standard skeleton for inference handling, designed for extension. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious skeleton for SageMaker inference handling. It does not contain malware, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. It serves as a base class meant to be extended with actual implementations. No security concerns are identified.",
