{
  "purpose": "Defines a basic template for inference handler functions in a SageMaker deployment, including model loading, input processing, prediction, and output serialization.",
  "sources": "Imports from sagemaker_inference (decoder, encoder, errors, utils); class and method definitions; no external or user input sources present.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write data to external systems or perform network operations; serialization functions encode data for responses, and decoding processes input data.",
  "flows": "Input data is decoded via decoder.decode in default_input_fn; predictions are generated in default_predict_fn (to be implemented); predictions are serialized via encoder.encode in default_output_fn.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; the class contains unimplemented methods that raise NotImplementedError, serving as templates. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard template for an inference handler, utilizing the sagemaker_inference library for data handling. It mainly contains method definitions, with some methods raising NotImplementedError as placeholders. No data leakage, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code relies on external libraries for decoding and encoding, which are standard for such applications. The structure is clear and focused on its purpose without hidden or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, templated implementation of an inference handler for SageMaker. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The use of external libraries for decoding and encoding is standard, and no anomalies or suspicious activities are detected.",
