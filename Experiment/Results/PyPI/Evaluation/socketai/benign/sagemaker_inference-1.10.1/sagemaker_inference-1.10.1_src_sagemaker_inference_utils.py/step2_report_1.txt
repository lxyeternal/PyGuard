  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The functions are straightforward utility functions with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** No. The reasoning is sound; the code is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security risk detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The functions are standard and safe.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** No. The reasoning aligns with the code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The functions are simple utilities.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** No.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Correct.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** No.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** No.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Correct.\n- **Justification:** All functions are standard, safe, and do not exhibit malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a set of utility functions performing safe file and header processing. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's benign nature. No changes are necessary.",
