  "purpose": "Utility functions for reading/writing files and processing request headers",
  "sources": "File reading/writing functions, request property dictionary, Accept header string, input string for prohibited characters",
  "sinks": "File system (read/write operations), return statements, string replacements",
  "flows": "File input/output functions read/write data, header retrieval returns header value, parse_accept processes header string, remove_crlf sanitizes input string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns or backdoors. Functions are standard utility operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic utility functions for file operations, header retrieval, header parsing, and string sanitization. The file functions open and read/write data to the filesystem without any input validation that could lead to injection, and they do not handle untrusted input directly. The header retrieval function uses a regex to match 'Content-Type' headers, which is standard and safe. The string sanitization removes carriage return and newline characters, which is a common security practice to prevent header injection or other injection attacks. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be straightforward utility functions with no external or malicious dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of standard utility functions with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It performs safe file I/O, header extraction, header parsing, and input sanitization. There are no anomalies or malicious behaviors detected. Overall, this code is safe and does not pose a security risk.",
