  "purpose": "Utility functions for reading/writing files, handling HTTP headers, and sanitizing input strings.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters such as 'request_property', 'accept', and 'illegal_string'.",
  "sinks": "Returning values from functions; reading from and writing to files; regex matching for headers.",
  "flows": "Input data from parameters flows into header retrieval, parsing, and sanitization functions without further propagation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns. The regex is standard. No code injection or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward utility functions with no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no use of untrusted data sources beyond input parameters. The file read/write functions are standard. The header retrieval uses regex matching, which is safe in this context. Input sanitization removes CR and LF characters as per documented purpose, without malicious intent. No hidden backdoors, suspicious behavior, or malicious data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of utility functions for file handling and HTTP header processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It performs standard operations with no security risks identified.",
