  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; functions are straightforward utility operations.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound; no suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0. These are appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; functions are standard utility code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning correctly identifies safe practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment; no modifications necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; functions are simple and safe.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The analysis is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; functions are straightforward.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is solid.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; utility functions are safe.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The analysis is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n- The code is a standard, safe utility module with no malicious or suspicious features.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that.",
