  "purpose": "Utility functions for file operations, request header processing, and string sanitization.",
  "sources": "Reads from file paths in read_file(), request_property dictionary in retrieve_content_type_header(), accept string in parse_accept(), illegal_string in remove_crlf().",
  "sinks": "Return statements in retrieve_content_type_header() and parse_accept() deliver data; write_file() writes data to files; remove_crlf() returns sanitized string.",
  "flows": "File reading/writing flows data from disk; request header retrieval flows data from request_property; string sanitization flows data from input to sanitized output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Functions perform standard operations; regex used is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic utility functions: reading and writing files, extracting headers from request dictionaries, parsing Accept headers, and sanitizing strings. All functions use standard Python libraries and straightforward logic. No obfuscated code, hidden dynamic execution, or suspicious behaviors are evident. No external network or system modification activities are present. The code appears benign and aligned with its utility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of standard utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely on input data and files without any malicious side-effects or hidden mechanisms. Overall, the code is safe.",
