  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Utility functions for file and header handling.  \n- Findings: No malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, straightforward code.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n- Conclusion: Benign utility library.  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is simple, safe, and standard. No issues found.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar utility functions.  \n- Findings: No suspicious patterns, no malicious behavior, sanitization of CRLF characters is standard.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The functions are standard, safe, and do not process untrusted data in a dangerous way.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Utility functions for file and header processing.  \n- Findings: No anomalies, no suspicious code, straightforward logic.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malicious indicators, safe practices.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Findings: No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, safe regex.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Utility functions, no malicious behavior.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Utility functions for file and header handling.  \n- Findings: No anomalies, no suspicious code, standard regex, safe sanitization.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malicious activity detected.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None detected in any report.  \n- **Obfuscation:** All reports confirm no obfuscation (score 0).  \n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Security risk:** All reports indicate no security risk (score 0).  \n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable given the code's straightforward utility nature.  \n- The absence of any suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators supports these scores.  \n- Since the code is purely utility functions with no external network calls, no untrusted code execution, and no handling of sensitive data beyond basic header processing, the risk remains minimal.\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (safe, utility functions with no security issues)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent with the actual code. The code is benign, safe, and free of malicious intent.",
