  "purpose": "Utility functions for reading/writing files, extracting headers, parsing accept headers, and sanitizing strings to remove prohibited characters.",
  "sources": "File paths in read_file and write_file functions; request_property dictionary in retrieve_content_type_header; accept string in parse_accept; illegal_string in remove_crlf.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write or process untrusted data in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities or data leaks; sanitization prevents header injection.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from external sources (file paths, request headers, strings) are processed within functions without unsafe operations or data flows leading to malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; regex is standard; string sanitization is a common security measure; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises straightforward utility functions: reading and writing files safely, extracting headers with regex matching, parsing accept headers, and sanitizing strings by removing CR and LF characters. All functions operate on input parameters in a safe manner, with no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no handling of sensitive data beyond basic header processing. The regex used is standard and safe. String sanitization prevents header injection. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code aligns with best practices for utility functions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module performing safe file and header processing. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
