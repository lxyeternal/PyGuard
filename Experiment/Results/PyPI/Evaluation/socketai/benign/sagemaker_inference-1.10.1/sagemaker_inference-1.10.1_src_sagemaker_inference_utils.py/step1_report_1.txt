  "purpose": "Utility functions for reading/writing files and handling HTTP request headers.",
  "sources": "Reading files with read_file; retrieving headers from request_property; input parameter 'accept' in parse_accept; input string 'illegal_string' in remove_crlf.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink points for untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities such as code injection or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data from request_property or function arguments are processed and returned; no flow to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions: reading and writing files, extracting HTTP headers, parsing accept headers, and sanitizing strings. All functions handle data safely, with no dynamic code execution, no suspicious data handling, and no obfuscated code. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The license header indicates it is an Amazon open-source utility module. No external or internal indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign utility library for file and request header processing with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
