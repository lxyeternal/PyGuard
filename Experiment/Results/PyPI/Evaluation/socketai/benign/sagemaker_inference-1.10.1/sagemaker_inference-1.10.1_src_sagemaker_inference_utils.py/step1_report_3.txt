  "purpose": "Utility functions for file operations, request header processing, and string sanitization.",
  "sources": "Reading files (`read_file`), retrieving headers from request properties (`retrieve_content_type_header`), processing `accept` header (`parse_accept`), and sanitizing input strings (`remove_crlf`).",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly write to external systems or invoke untrusted code. The functions read files, process headers, and sanitize strings without executing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input from file paths, request property dictionaries, accept header strings, and strings for sanitization are processed locally within functions. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward utility functions with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple utility functions: reading and writing files, extracting content-type headers via regex, parsing accept headers, and removing CRLF characters from strings. All functions operate on local data or inputs and do not execute or evaluate untrusted code beyond string processing. The regex is safe and standard; string replacement is straightforward. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code appears to be standard utility code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions for file handling and header processing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, uses safe practices, and does not contain malicious logic.",
