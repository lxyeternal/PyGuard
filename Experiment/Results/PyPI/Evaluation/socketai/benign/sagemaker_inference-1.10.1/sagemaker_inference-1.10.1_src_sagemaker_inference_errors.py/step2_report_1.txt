  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Backdoors:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is straightforward, defining custom exception classes with no external data reading, network activity, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or embedded malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is purely for error handling, with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reasoning aligns with the code's structure and purpose.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, non-obfuscated code.  \n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable since there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Justification for Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely for exception handling with no external interactions, the risk score should remain at 0. The code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Report Content:**  \n   The scores are consistent and justified given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.**\n\n---\n\n### My Personal Estimate:\n\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for an inference framework, with no malicious or security-compromising features.\n\n**Final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and free of security issues.",
