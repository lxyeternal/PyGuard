{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling unsupported formats and inference errors in a machine learning inference framework.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or data directly from external sources; it only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data or outputs to untrusted sources; it only manages exception messages.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only structures exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. It uses standard exception handling and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code provides exception class definitions with detailed docstrings and standard Python exception inheritance. The constructor methods store parameters and prepare exception messages, with no dynamic code execution, input reading, or network operations. No obfuscated or suspicious code features are present. It appears to be standard and legitimate for error handling within a framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions used for error reporting in a machine learning inference framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
