  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and intended solely for exception handling. The only issue is a syntax indentation bug that should be fixed for proper execution. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the code's nature."
