{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors in a SageMaker inference framework.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources are read; code defines classes and methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; error messages are static or constructed from input parameters but do not appear to process untrusted external data directly.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from external untrusted sources to critical sinks; exception parameters are passed during instantiation but do not process untrusted data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes for use within a machine learning inference framework. It contains a typical pattern of custom exception inheritance, message formatting, and error handling. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or backdoors. The code appears to be straightforward exception handling infrastructure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It serves a clear purpose in error reporting without involving any suspicious or malicious activity.",
