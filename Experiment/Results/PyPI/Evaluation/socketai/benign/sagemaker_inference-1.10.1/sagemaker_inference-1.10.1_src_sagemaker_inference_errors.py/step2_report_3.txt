  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code only defines custom exception classes, with no data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No external sources are read during runtime, and no untrusted data is processed directly.\n- Exception messages are constructed from parameters passed during instantiation, which are controlled within the application.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The use of textwrap.dedent is standard for formatting messages; no malicious intent is evident.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward, legitimate part of an error handling framework for a machine learning inference system.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The purpose is clearly to define custom exceptions for unsupported formats and inference errors.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, or external calls are identified.\n- The exception classes inherit properly, and message formatting is standard.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the straightforward, non-obfuscated code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5, but given the analysis, a risk score of 0 is appropriate because the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n\n- The reports are very consistent and cautious, correctly identifying the code as benign.\n- No changes are needed in the scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is purely for exception handling, with no external interactions, no data processing from untrusted sources, and no malicious patterns. It is a standard, benign implementation for error reporting within a framework.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and does not pose any security or malware risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
