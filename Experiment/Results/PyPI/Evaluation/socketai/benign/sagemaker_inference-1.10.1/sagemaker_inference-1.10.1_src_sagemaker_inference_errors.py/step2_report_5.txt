  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code defines three custom exception classes:\n     - `UnsupportedFormatError`\n     - `BaseInferenceToolkitError`\n     - `GenericInferenceToolkitError`\n   - The classes primarily handle error messaging, with constructors formatting messages and passing parameters to superclass constructors.\n   - No input/output operations, network calls, or data processing are present.\n   - The code uses standard Python exception handling and string formatting (`textwrap.dedent`).\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Elements:**\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or external resource access.\n   - Exception messages are constructed from parameters, which are controlled within the code or at runtime, not from untrusted sources.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, benign, and solely for error handling.\n   - They assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n   - The security risk is 0, as there are no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intents.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - The **malware score** of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is detected.\n   - The **obfuscated score** of 0 is correct; the code is clear and standard.\n   - The **risk score** of 0.5 or higher is not justified; the code does not introduce any security risks.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions or Claims:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about external data or behaviors.\n   - They focus on the code's purpose and structure, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and the reports' conclusions.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable score assignments are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nThe code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for an inference framework. It is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, straightforward, and serves its purpose in error handling.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary based on the current analysis.\n\n**End of review.**",
