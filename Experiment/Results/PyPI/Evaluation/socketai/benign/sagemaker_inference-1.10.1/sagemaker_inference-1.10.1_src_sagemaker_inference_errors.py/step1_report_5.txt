{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling unsupported formats and inference errors in a machine learning framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters for exception initialization, such as 'content_type', 'status_code', 'message', and 'phrase'.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows lead to external system calls, network activity, or data leaks. The code only handles internal exception messages.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to construct exception messages and store error details; no untrusted data flow to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The code primarily handles exception message formatting and class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception class definitions with straightforward message formatting. It uses textwrap.dedent to create human-readable messages. There are no external resource accesses, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors. The exceptions are standard and used for internal error handling. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in a machine learning inference context. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
