{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in an inference framework, specifically related to unsupported formats and inference issues.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; exceptions are instantiated with parameters within the code.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages are constructed and stored, but not used to execute or influence other code directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; exception parameters are controlled within the code and not derived from external untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. Exception handling is standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes with constructors that format messages. The content is purely informational and does not include any network activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior. No inputs are read from untrusted sources, and no outputs are directed to external systems. All exception messages are generated from parameters passed internally or at runtime, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of custom exceptions used for error handling in an inference framework. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and intended solely for error reporting.",
