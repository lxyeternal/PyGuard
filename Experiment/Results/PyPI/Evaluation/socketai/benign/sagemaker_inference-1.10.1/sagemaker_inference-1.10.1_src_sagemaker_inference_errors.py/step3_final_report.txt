{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in an inference framework, specifically for unsupported formats and inference errors.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed during exception instantiation, controlled within the application; no external data reading.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages constructed from parameters; no external data sinks or leaks.",
  "flows": "Parameters flow from calling code into exception constructors, then into superclass initializers; no external or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Indentation error in UnsupportedFormatError's __init__ method (incorrect indentation level), which would cause a syntax error. No malicious or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions, with message formatting using textwrap.dedent. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The exception classes are standard, and their usage is confined to error reporting within the application. The indentation bug in UnsupportedFormatError is a syntax issue, not a security concern. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's purpose is purely for error handling, with no external interactions or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and intended solely for exception handling. The only issue is a syntax indentation bug that should be fixed for proper execution. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the code's nature.",
