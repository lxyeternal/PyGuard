  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code only defines custom exception classes.\n- No external data is read or written; no network activity or data leaks.\n- The code uses standard Python exception inheritance, message formatting, and docstrings.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose is purely error handling within a framework, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n\n- The code does **not** read input from untrusted sources nor write to untrusted sinks.\n- The exception messages are constructed from parameters, but these are controlled within the application context.\n- The use of `textwrap.dedent` is benign and for formatting.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data exfiltration are evident.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n\n- The code appears correct and well-structured.\n- Minor note: In `UnsupportedFormatError`, the `__init__` method is indented incorrectly (it's indented one level too deep). This is a syntax error in Python and would prevent the code from running. However, this is a code correctness issue, not a security concern.\n- No other logical or security flaws are apparent.\n\n**Scores and their justification:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified because the code is purely for exception handling and contains no security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n\n- The indentation error in `UnsupportedFormatError` should be noted as a code correctness bug, but it does not affect security.\n- Since all reports agree on benignity, no score adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n**Final notes:**\n\n- The only issue is the indentation bug in `UnsupportedFormatError`, which should be fixed for the code to run properly.\n- There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is benign, standard exception class definitions.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk factors are present.\n- The only flaw is a syntax indentation error in `UnsupportedFormatError`.\n\n**Recommended action:** Fix the indentation bug to ensure the code is syntactically correct. Otherwise, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Final Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Note:** The indentation bug does not influence security assessment but should be corrected for code correctness.",
