  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate deployment script for SageMaker inference servers, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the reliance on environment variables, which could be manipulated externally, but this is standard in cloud deployment environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the potential attack surface but no active threat."
