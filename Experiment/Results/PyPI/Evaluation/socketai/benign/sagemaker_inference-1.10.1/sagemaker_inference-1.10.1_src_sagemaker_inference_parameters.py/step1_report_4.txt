{
  "purpose": "Define string constants for inference toolkit parameters used in SageMaker environment configurations.",
  "sources": "Environment variables such as 'SAGEMAKER_BASE_DIR', 'SAGEMAKER_PROGRAM', etc., which are typically read by the runtime environment or other modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive environment variables could be accessed or modified by other parts of the system, but there are no direct sinks that perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are likely read at runtime; no explicit data flows are visible in this static code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and consists solely of string constants. No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a set of string constants representing environment variable names related to SageMaker inference configuration. There is no logic, no data processing, and no external calls. All variables are standard and documented in AWS SageMaker, indicating typical usage. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign configuration setup defining environment variable names for SageMaker inference parameters. It contains no malicious or suspicious code. It appears to be a standard, safe part of the SDK or deployment process.",
