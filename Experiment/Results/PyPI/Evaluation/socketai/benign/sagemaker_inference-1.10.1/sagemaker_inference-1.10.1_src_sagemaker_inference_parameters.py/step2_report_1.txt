  "review": "Let's review the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of constant string definitions for environment variable names used in SageMaker inference toolkit.\n   - There are no dynamic elements, no input/output processing, no external data handling, and no functions or logic that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is static, benign, and purely declarative.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the summaries; they are consistent and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or malicious.\n   - The environment variable definitions are standard configuration constants.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct.\n   - There is no indication of malicious behavior or intent.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent; they rely on the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report Content:**\n   - The scores are consistent and justified given the benign, static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard configuration module defining environment variable names. It contains no logic, no data processing, and no external interactions. All indicators point to a benign, non-malicious, and non-obfuscated snippet.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current scores are appropriate and justified. No changes are necessary.",
