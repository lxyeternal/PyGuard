  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining static string constants for environment variable names used in SageMaker inference toolkit.\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic behavior, input handling, network operations, or data processing.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are identified.\n- All reports have high confidence (1), and scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are zero, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  The code is purely defining constants; there are no issues such as vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation. The reports correctly identify this.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Any mistakes in reasoning?**  \n  No. The reports accurately interpret the code as benign configuration constants.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Any changes needed?**  \n  No. The scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- **Are any scores higher than 0.5 justified?**  \n  No. The code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks, so a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Malware score:\n- **Malware presence?**  \n  None. The code contains no malicious payloads or behaviors.\n\n### Assumptions about vulnerabilities:\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- **Are the scores consistent?**  \n  Yes. All scores are aligned with the code's static, benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven all the reports and the code content, I concur with the evaluations provided. The code is a standard configuration module with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is simple, static, and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior. It is a benign part of a configuration setup for SageMaker.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary. The code is safe, non-malicious, and standard for its purpose.",
