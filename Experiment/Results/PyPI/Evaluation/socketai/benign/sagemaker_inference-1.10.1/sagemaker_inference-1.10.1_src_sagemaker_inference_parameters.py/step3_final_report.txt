  "purpose": "Define string constants for environment variable names used in SageMaker inference toolkit configuration.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments of environment variable names within the module.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; constants are used as configuration identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants representing environment variable names for SageMaker. It imports __future__.absolute_import for compatibility but does not include functions, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The constants are standard configuration identifiers, and the code's purpose is purely declarative. All evidence indicates a benign, static configuration module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious configuration constants module with no security risks or obfuscation. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with its benign nature.",
