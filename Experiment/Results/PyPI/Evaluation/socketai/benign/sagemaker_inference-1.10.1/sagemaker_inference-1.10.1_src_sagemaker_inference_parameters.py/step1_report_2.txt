{
  "purpose": "Define string constants for inference toolkit parameters, mainly environment variable names used in SageMaker deployment.",
  "sources": "Environment variable names assigned to string constants",
  "sinks": "Not present; the code only defines constants, no data flow or processing occurs",
  "flows": "No data flow, as there are no functions or data manipulations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code simply declares constants without any suspicious or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists of constant string declarations for environment variable names related to SageMaker inference parameters. It includes licensing information and comments. No input reading, data processing, or external communication is present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, benign, and solely defines environment variable name constants for inference configurations. No malicious or security risk behaviors are present.",
