{
  "purpose": "Define string constants for inference toolkit parameters related to SageMaker environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables that the code references (e.g., 'SAGEMAKER_BASE_DIR', 'SAGEMAKER_PROGRAM', etc.)",
  "sinks": "None present; the code only defines constants, no data processing or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing; the constants are used as configuration keys elsewhere",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing __future__ for compatibility and defining string constants for environment variable keys. No input reading, data processing, or untrusted data handling is present. There are no apparent vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This module merely defines constants for environment variable keys used by SageMaker inference toolkit. It poses no security threats, malware risks, or obfuscation issues. The code is benign and standard for configuration purposes.",
