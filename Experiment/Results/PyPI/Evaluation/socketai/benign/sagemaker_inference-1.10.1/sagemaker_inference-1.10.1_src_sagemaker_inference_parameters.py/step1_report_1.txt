{
  "purpose": "Define string constants for inference toolkit parameters related to SageMaker environment variables.",
  "sources": "None; all are constant string definitions assigned to environment variable names.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks as all are static constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward constant declarations with no dynamic or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature for compatibility, then assigns string constants representing environment variable names used by SageMaker inference toolkit. These are simple constant assignments with no dynamic code, external input, or processing. The code does not include any input handling, network operations, or sensitive data management. It appears to be a standard configuration module intended for use elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "This module contains standard, non-malicious constant definitions for environment variables. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
