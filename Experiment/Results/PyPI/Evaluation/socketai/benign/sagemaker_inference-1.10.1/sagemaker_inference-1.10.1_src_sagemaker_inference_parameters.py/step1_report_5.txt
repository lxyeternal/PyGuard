  "purpose": "Define string constants for inference toolkit parameters related to Amazon SageMaker environment variables.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string literals to variables representing environment variable names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; only static string constants are used.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; variables are assigned static strings with no dynamic or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated, malicious, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future statement for compatibility, then defines several string constants representing environment variable names used by SageMaker. All are static, hardcoded strings with no dynamic content or external input. There are no functions, no external data reads, and no risky operations. The code appears purely declarative, serving as configuration constants without any execution logic or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This module contains static definitions of environment variable names used for SageMaker inference configurations. There is no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks evident in this code. It is a benign configuration snippet.",
