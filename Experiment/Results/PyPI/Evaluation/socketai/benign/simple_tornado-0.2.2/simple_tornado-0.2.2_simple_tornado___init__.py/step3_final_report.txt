  "purpose": "A Tornado web server setup supporting CORS, static files, and platform-specific adjustments, intended for serving web applications.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for address and port, environment variables (DEBUG), socket binding for port check, signal handling for Windows, and request handlers.",
  "sinks": "None present; code does not perform data leaks, network connections, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Configuration inputs (args, env vars) influence server setup; no data flows to insecure sinks; server runs request loop.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out port check function (_is_port_listening) which could lead to port conflicts but not malicious activity; no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Tornado server initialization script with platform-specific tweaks and environment-based debug mode. The port check function is commented out, which might cause port conflicts but does not introduce security risks. No suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The environment variables and signal handling are typical. The code is benign and intended for typical web server deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward Tornado server setup with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The only minor operational concern is the commented-out port check, which does not pose a security threat. Overall, the code is safe, clear, and well-structured.",
