  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, attempting to parse README.md for description.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, importing parse_from_file from m2r module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "Importing parse_from_file -> reading README.md -> passing description to setuptools.setup.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import with fallback; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script that optionally parses README.md using m2r. It handles import errors gracefully and proceeds with setup. No network activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior are present. The reliance on an external parsing library is typical for documentation handling. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from dependency reliance, which is common and not inherently dangerous. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1). No modifications are necessary.",
