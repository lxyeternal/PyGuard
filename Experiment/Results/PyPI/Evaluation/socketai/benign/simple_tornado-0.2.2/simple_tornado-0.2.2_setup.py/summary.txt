  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from dependency reliance, which is common and not inherently dangerous. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1). No modifications are necessary."
