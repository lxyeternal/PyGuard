  "purpose": "Configure pytest testing framework options based on environment and version conditions.",
  "sources": "Reads system information (platform.machine(), sys.version, sys.version_info), file paths (path parameter), and sys.version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or leads to potential vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "System information is used to determine environment constraints; no data flows into security-critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is primarily environment and configuration logic. No obfuscation, malicious data exfiltration, or system disruption present.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically adjusts pytest options based on Python version, platform, and environment (e.g., PyPy, architecture). It uses environment info to include or exclude test paths and modify pytest settings. No user input handling, network operations, or system modifications are present. The code is straightforward configuration logic with no malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script for pytest, adapting test settings according to environment. No malicious or security risks identified.",
