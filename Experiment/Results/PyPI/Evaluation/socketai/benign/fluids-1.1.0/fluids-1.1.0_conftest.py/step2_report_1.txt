  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations from the code:**\n\n- The code is primarily environment detection and pytest configuration.\n- No user input, network activity, or data processing beyond configuration.\n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks.\n- Contains commented-out code and some redundant conditions, typical of environment-specific scripts.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:** The report states the code is benign, focusing on test configuration, with no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n- The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior.\n- The security risk score of 0.1 seems slightly high given the benign nature; perhaps 0.0 is more appropriate unless considering potential misconfigurations.\n\n**Recommendation:** The risk score should be **0.0**; the malware score is correctly 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing environment-aware pytest configuration with no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n- The reasoning is consistent.\n- The security risk score of 0.1 may be slightly high; this code does not pose any security threat.\n\n**Recommendation:** Adjust risk to **0.0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:** Reiterates benign environment detection and test configuration, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n- Fully aligned with the code.\n- No issues.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:** Similar benign environment configuration, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n- Correctly identified as benign.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:** Environment detection and pytest configuration, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n- Accurate assessment.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional notes:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The only minor inconsistency is the small security risk score (0.1) in reports 1 and 2, which should be 0. given the benign nature.\n- The malware score is correctly 0 across all reports.\n- Obfuscation is correctly identified as absent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n\n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward environment-aware pytest configuration script.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior is present.\n- The existing scores are mostly accurate, with minor adjustments needed for the risk score in reports 1 and 2.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, benign, and intended for test environment configuration. The scores should reflect zero malware, no obfuscation, and no security risk.",
