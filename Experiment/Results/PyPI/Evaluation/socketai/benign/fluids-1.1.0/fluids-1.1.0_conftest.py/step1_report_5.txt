  "purpose": "Configure pytest testing environment based on Python version, platform, and path names.",
  "sources": "Reads system information via sys.version, platform.machine(), platform.python_version_tuple(), sys.version, and path strings.",
  "sinks": "Modifies pytest configuration via config.addinivalue_line() and config.option, which influence test execution behavior.",
  "flows": "System info (version, machine, path) → conditional logic → pytest configuration modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code mainly performs environment detection and config adjustments.",
  "analysis": "The code detects environment specifics like Python implementation (PyPy), version, machine type, and file path contents. It conditionally adjusts pytest settings based on these factors. The functions do not handle untrusted data or perform any network or file I/O beyond configuration adjustments. No obfuscated code, malicious data leakage, or suspicious behavior observed. The purpose is purely environment-aware configuration for testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment configuration script for pytest, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It merely adjusts pytest options based on system attributes.",
