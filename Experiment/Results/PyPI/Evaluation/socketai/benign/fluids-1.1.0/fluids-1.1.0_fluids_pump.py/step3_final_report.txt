  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and static data for calculating efficiencies of pumps, motors, VFDs, and related electrical standards, primarily for engineering modeling and analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as flow rate, power, head, frequency, and voltage; it also accesses static lookup tables for efficiencies and electrical standards.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or sinks; calculations are performed on provided parameters and internal static data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions which perform mathematical calculations and data lookups; no external data flows or dynamic code execution are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; static data tables are domain-specific and straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static data tables, mathematical functions, and constants related to efficiencies, sizes, and electrical standards. There are no external data fetches, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The data is well-documented and domain-specific, typical for engineering utility libraries. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident. The functions perform straightforward calculations based on input parameters. The static data and functions are consistent with standard engineering practices, and no secrets or external interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, domain-specific utility library for efficiency calculations and electrical standards, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. It is safe for supply chain deployment in engineering contexts.",
