{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and data related to pump efficiency, motor efficiency, VFD efficiency, NEMA motor sizes, electrical power data, and utility constants for process modeling in chemical engineering.",
  "sources": "Reads constants from 'fluids.constants' and 'fluids.numerics', and contains various hardcoded data arrays and dictionaries defining efficiencies, sizes, voltages, frequencies, and other parameters.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sink points or untrusted data outputs; functions compute efficiencies and sizes based on inputs, but do not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to functions (e.g., flow rate, power, voltage, frequency) are used internally for calculations; no data flows outside the module.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily contains static data, mathematical functions, and data structures. No dynamic execution, code injection, or obfuscated code is present. The data appears to be standard engineering constants and lookup tables.",
  "analysis": "The module provides multiple functions to estimate efficiencies and sizes using well-known formulas, with static data tables for efficiency curves and standard sizes. No indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior are present. The code does not perform any network communication, system modifications, or data exfiltration. It mainly contains static constants, lookup tables, and simple computational functions. No code executes external commands or handles untrusted input. The data appears to be industry standard and static. There are no obfuscated elements, hidden backdoors, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of engineering utility functions and static data for process modeling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
