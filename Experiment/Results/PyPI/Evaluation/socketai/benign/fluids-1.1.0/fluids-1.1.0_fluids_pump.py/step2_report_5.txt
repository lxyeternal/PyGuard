  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code details, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Utility library for process modeling, efficiencies, electrical data.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Static data, straightforward functions, no external data or network activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No malicious indicators are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, utility functions for efficiencies, electrical data.\n- **Assessment:** Functions operate on input parameters with no external data fetching or code injection. Static data and formulas are standard for engineering calculations.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis is consistent. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for efficiencies, sizes, electrical data.\n- **Assessment:** Static data, no external data flow, no network or system commands, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Clear and consistent. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, process modeling utilities.\n- **Assessment:** Static data, straightforward calculations, no external data or code execution.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for efficiencies and electrical standards.\n- **Assessment:** Static data, standard formulas, no external data or malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero, but still negligible)\n\n**Verdict:** No signs of malicious intent. The slight elevation in security risk is likely due to the presence of extensive static data, which is typical in such utility modules.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily static data, mathematical formulas, and lookup tables related to engineering efficiencies and electrical standards.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** No evidence of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, backdoors, or external data fetching. The code relies on trusted libraries (`math`, `fluids.constants`, `fluids.numerics`) and performs standard calculations.\n- **Data & Functions:** All data appears static, well-documented, domain-specific, and consistent with engineering practices.\n- **Security Risks:** No network calls, no file I/O, no dynamic code execution, no embedded credentials or secrets.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the static data and standard calculations, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted. The only slight concern is the large static data, but it is typical and not malicious.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to extensive static data but no real security threat)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign, domain-specific utility library with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. It is safe for supply chain use within its intended engineering context.",
