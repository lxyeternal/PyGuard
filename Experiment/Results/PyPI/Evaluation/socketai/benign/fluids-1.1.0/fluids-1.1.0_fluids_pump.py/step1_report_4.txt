{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and data for process modeling, including efficiencies, utilities for motors, pumps, electrical systems, and power data for various countries.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from 'math' and 'fluids.constants' and 'fluids.numerics'; defines multiple constants, dictionaries, lists, and functions for efficiency calculations, power data, and electrical configurations.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code mainly contains mathematical calculations, data definitions, and class constructors for electrical power data.",
  "flows": "N/A, no flow of untrusted data from source to sink; functions operate on numerical parameters or static data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors; extensive data tables and constants are included, but they are static and well-documented. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed. No network connections or external data fetches are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for efficiency estimation and utility calculations related to pumps, motors, VFDs, and electrical power data for countries. It imports standard math functions and external libraries that provide numerical interpolation. The data tables are static and extensive, likely for lookup or interpolation purposes. No signs of code injection, malicious data handling, or hidden functionalities are evident. All functions perform expected mathematical operations on input parameters. No external inputs are read during execution; no network activity, system modifications, or suspicious data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility library focused on process engineering and electrical power data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It is well-structured and documented for its purpose. No security risks or malicious anomalies are identified.",
