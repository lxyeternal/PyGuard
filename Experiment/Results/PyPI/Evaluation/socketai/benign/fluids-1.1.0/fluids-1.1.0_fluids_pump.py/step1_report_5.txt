{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and data related to pump, motor, VFD efficiencies, electrical power parameters, and electrical standards for process modeling in chemical engineering.",
  "sources": "Data definitions and constants, including efficiency tables, power standards, country-specific electrical data, and utility functions calculating efficiencies, power, and electrical parameters.",
  "sinks": "Mathematical functions calculating efficiencies, power, current, and other electrical parameters; data structures for efficiency tables; no apparent untrusted input or data sinks that could lead to data leaks or code injection.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to efficiency functions (Q, P, load, etc.) are used in calculations but are all numeric and controlled; no flow of untrusted external data; no external data or command execution involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; extensive use of mathematical formulas and data tables; no obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or misleading variables; data tables appear to be static data for efficiency curves.",
  "analysis": "The code predominantly contains definitions of constants, data tables, and straightforward functions calculating efficiencies, power, and electrical parameters. No external data input, network communication, file I/O, or code execution that could be malicious. The functions perform standard calculations based on well-documented formulas. Data tables and constants are static and relate to industry standards or empirical data. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a collection of utility functions and static data for process modeling and electrical standards in chemical engineering. There are no indications of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command injection, backdoors, or hidden malicious logic. It is safe in the context of supply chain security; the functions and data serve legitimate modeling purposes.",
