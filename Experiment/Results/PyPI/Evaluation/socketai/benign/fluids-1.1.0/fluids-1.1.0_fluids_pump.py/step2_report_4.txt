  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the security implications step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the module as a utility library for efficiencies, pump/motor modeling, and electrical data. Matches the code content.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sources or sinks, only internal calculations and static data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, no secrets. The data tables are static lookup tables, standard in engineering software.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear, safe, and well-documented. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and confidence is high (0.95).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. No security concerns. **Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low, as a precaution).**  \n*No changes needed.*\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Also describes the code as utility functions with static data, matching the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Inputs are parameters; no external data or system interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no dynamic code, no network activity. Data is static, domain-specific.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is safe, domain-specific, and free of malicious behavior. Confidence is 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent. No malicious behavior detected. **Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.**  \n*No changes needed.*\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes static data, constants, and straightforward functions for efficiencies and sizes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or system calls; purely computational.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Static data, no obfuscation, no external code execution, no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard engineering utility code. Confidence is 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. No security issues. **Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.**  \n*No changes needed.*\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, static data, constants, and calculation functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or system calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Static data, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, domain-specific. Confidence is 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious behavior. **Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.**  \n*No changes needed.*\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern: static data, constants, calculation functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or command execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no dynamic code, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, static data and straightforward functions. Confidence is 0.9, slightly lower but still high.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent. The only note is the slightly lower confidence (0.9), but that’s reasonable given the extensive static data. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.  \n  **Estimated malware score: 0 for all reports.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly note no obfuscation.  \n  **Estimated obfuscated score: 0 for all reports.**\n\n- **Risk Score:** The reports assign a very low risk (around 0.1), which is appropriate given the static data and standard functions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Risk Score:** **0.1** (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code contains no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no embedded secrets, and no obfuscation.  \n- It is a domain-specific utility library with static data and mathematical functions, typical in engineering software.  \n- The extensive data tables are static lookup data, not malicious payloads.  \n- The functions perform straightforward calculations without side effects.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are reasonable and consistent. No further action or concern is warranted from a security perspective.",
