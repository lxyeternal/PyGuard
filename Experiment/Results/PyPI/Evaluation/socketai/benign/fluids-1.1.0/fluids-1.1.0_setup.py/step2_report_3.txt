  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, package data, and reads the README file for long_description. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing is present.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies:**  \n   None of the reports identify any suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code. The script performs typical setup operations with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual patterns. The reading of 'README.rst' is standard and not inherently risky.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, readable nature of the code.  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0.0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0.0, which is justified given the benign nature of the script.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**  \n   The only minor point is the use of `open('README.rst').read()`. While standard, if the README file were maliciously altered, it could potentially introduce issues, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious or obfuscated.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**  \n   The code is a typical, benign setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (all zeros) are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0.0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign, standard nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern indicators. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
