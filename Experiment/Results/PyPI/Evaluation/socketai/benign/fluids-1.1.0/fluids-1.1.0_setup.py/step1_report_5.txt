{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'fluids' Python package, providing package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Import of 'setuptools' module, package_data specification, and reading of 'README.rst' for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sinks such as network or file operations beyond standard package setup procedures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no dynamic code execution or external data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open('README.rst').read()' could potentially be risky if the file contents are maliciously altered, but this is a standard pattern in setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script utilizing setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and data files. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The reading of 'README.rst' is a common practice for long description and does not introduce security risks assuming the file is controlled. All code is static and directly related to package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign package setup file with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard practices without obfuscated or suspicious code.",
