  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'fluids' library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' for long_description, package data files from specified directories.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no external data processing, no network activity.",
  "flows": "Static metadata and dependencies; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscated patterns. It reads a README file for description and specifies dependencies and package data in a standard manner. No suspicious behaviors or malicious code are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, aligning with the benign nature of the script. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, benign package configuration file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
