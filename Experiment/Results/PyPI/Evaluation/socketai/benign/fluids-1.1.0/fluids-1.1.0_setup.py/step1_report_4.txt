  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'fluids' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, license, version, description, dependencies, and package data configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; the code does not process or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A, as this is static setup configuration without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code follows standard setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata for distribution, including classifiers, description, dependencies, author info, and package data. It loads a README file for long description. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data processing is present. All operations are static configuration steps typical of a Python package setup script. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious intent, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It primarily defines package metadata and dependencies, with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
