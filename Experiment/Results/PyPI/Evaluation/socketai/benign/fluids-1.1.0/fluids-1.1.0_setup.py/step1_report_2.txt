{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the 'fluids' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "User inputs include 'long_description' read from 'README.rst'; package dependencies specified in 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks that execute untrusted code or leak data; no network or system calls present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads ('README.rst') and dependency specifications into setup configuration; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard setup configuration with no obfuscated code, malicious imports, or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded credentials or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' to define package metadata, dependencies, and package data. It reads 'README.rst' for long description, specifies dependencies with fixed minimum versions, and includes comprehensive classifiers and package data. No code execution, network activity, or dynamic code loading occurs. The structure is typical for a Python package setup script. No anomalies, suspicious imports, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script for distributing the 'fluids' library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
