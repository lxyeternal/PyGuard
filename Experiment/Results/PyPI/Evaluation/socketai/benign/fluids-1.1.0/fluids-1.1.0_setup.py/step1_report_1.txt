  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'fluids' Python package, part of the Chemical Engineering Design Library (ChEDL), used for process modeling and fluid dynamics calculations.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, license, description, dependencies, author info, package data files, and README file.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious output; the script mainly configures package installation.",
  "flows": "N/A; no dynamic or external data flows are present that could be exploited.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The script performs standard setup operations with no obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools for package configuration. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, data files, and author info. All operations are typical for Python packaging and do not include any code execution, network activity, or data handling that could indicate malicious intent. The README is read for long_description, which is standard. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical and benign Python package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
