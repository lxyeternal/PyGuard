{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for chemical engineering process modeling, specifically related to mixing calculations, mixer design, and flow analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters and some constants (e.g., g from fluids.constants). No external data sources or user input handling is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leakage or malicious effects; functions return computed values based on input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through mathematical calculations within each function; no flow of untrusted data to external systems or network occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; all functions perform domain-specific calculations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a set of engineering utility functions with clear mathematical formulas, constants, and documented parameters. The functions are standard calculations used in process engineering for mixing and flow analysis. The data is passed via parameters, with no external data fetching or code execution beyond mathematical operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden functionalities. The only data stored are the imported constants and the predefined dictionaries for mixers, which are benign. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, domain-specific utility library without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of engineering calculations related to fluid mixing processes. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The functions and data are typical for this domain, and no suspicious patterns or anomalies are present.",
