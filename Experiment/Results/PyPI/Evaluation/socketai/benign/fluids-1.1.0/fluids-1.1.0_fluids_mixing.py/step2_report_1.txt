  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code is domain-specific, mathematical, and references standard literature. No external data sources or network activity. The only external data is the imported constant `g`, which is benign.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the conclusion.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no security concerns.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high certainty.\n\n**Verdict:** The code appears legitimate, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the functions are domain-specific, referencing authoritative sources. The only external data is the constant `g`. Contact info (email) is included but not suspicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low; perhaps just the presence of contact info and static data.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high confidence in safety.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity; code is standard for engineering calculations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are straightforward, referencing standard constants and literature. No external data sources beyond standard libraries. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — negligible.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — certainty.\n\n**Verdict:** Safe, legitimate engineering utility code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—standard calculations, no external or untrusted data sources, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous assessments; functions are mathematical, domain-specific, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. Contact info is benign.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports agree on 0. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, code is transparent and domain-specific.\n- **Risk scores:** The only minor concern is the presence of contact info and static data, but these are standard in open-source scientific code. The second report assigns a very low security risk (0.1), which is reasonable.\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious intent detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code, I would assign a **risk score of 0**. The existing reports are aligned with this, except one assigns 0.1, which is acceptable as a very conservative measure.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a legitimate, domain-specific utility library for chemical engineering process modeling. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this, with **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, and **risk = 0**.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analyses and the nature of the code.",
