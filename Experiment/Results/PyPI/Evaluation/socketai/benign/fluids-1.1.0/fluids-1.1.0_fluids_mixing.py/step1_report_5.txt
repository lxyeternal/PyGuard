{
  "purpose": "Provide utilities and calculations related to process modeling in chemical engineering, specifically mixing, flow, and tank agitation.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from math and fluids.constants, no external data inputs or untrusted sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data is used for critical operations; calculations are based on parameters provided to functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters through mathematical operations for modeling purposes; no untrusted data from external sources or network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Functions perform domain-specific calculations with no apparent malicious intent. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or misleading variable usage. External contact info (email, GitHub link) is benign and relevant to software maintenance.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of mathematical and domain-specific functions for fluid mechanics and mixing calculations, relying on input parameters. No external or untrusted data sources, network activity, or code that could perform malicious actions are present. The code does not perform any system modifications, data exfiltration, or backdoor activities. All functions are clearly documented, and dependencies are standard mathematical modules and a constants library. The email address and GitHub URL are for bug reporting and contributions, not suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of engineering utility functions with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate scientific/engineering module intended for process modeling. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
