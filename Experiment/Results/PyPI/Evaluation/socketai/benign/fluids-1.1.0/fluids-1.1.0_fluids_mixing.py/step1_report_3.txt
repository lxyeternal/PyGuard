{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for process modeling in chemical engineering, including functions for mixing calculations, flow variance, and mixing device parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads constant values from 'math' and 'fluids.constants', and accepts input parameters through function arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code performs calculations based on input parameters, but does not contain data output sinks such as network connections or file writes. No evidence of untrusted data being used to execute or leak information.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions which perform mathematical computations; no external or untrusted data sources are accessed at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code segments. No obfuscated code, external code execution, or unusual data handling detected. The code is straightforward in performing engineering calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of engineering utility functions for process mixing and flow calculations. It imports standard libraries and constants, and defines functions with clear parameter inputs and mathematical outputs. The functions perform standard physics-based computations without dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. The included mixer data is static and sourced from a referenced engineering handbook. No code appears to perform malicious actions, hide behaviors, or execute untrusted commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, transparent, and purely scientific in purpose. No malicious behavior or sabotage evident. The functions are well-documented and serve to perform standard engineering calculations.",
