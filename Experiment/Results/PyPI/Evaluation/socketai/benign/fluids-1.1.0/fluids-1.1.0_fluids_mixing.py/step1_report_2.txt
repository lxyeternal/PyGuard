{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for process modeling in chemical engineering, including calculations for mixing times, mixer design parameters, and Coefficient of Variation (CoV) estimations in various mixing scenarios.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as flow rates, geometric dimensions, physical properties, and constants imported from external modules (e.g., fluids.constants.g).",
  "sinks": "Potential data outputs include calculation results for mixing times, CoV values, power-Reynolds number products, and loss coefficients; these are returned as numerical values.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through mathematical formulas within functions, often involving physical properties and geometric ratios, leading to output calculations like time estimates, CoV, or K-values. No external untrusted data sources or network inputs are used.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hidden network activity, code obfuscation, or data leaks, are present. The functions and data appear standard for engineering calculations. External email contact is included but not suspicious in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a collection of domain-specific calculation functions with clearly defined inputs and outputs. It includes references to standard engineering literature, suggesting legitimate use. No hardcoded credentials, hidden code, or obfuscated code structures are detected. The imported constant 'g' is from a reputable module, and there is no dynamic code execution or suspicious data handling. External contact information is present but not indicative of malicious activity. Overall, the code appears safe and intended solely for engineering purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate set of engineering utility functions with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs standard calculations based on physical principles and references authoritative sources. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
