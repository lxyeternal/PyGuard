{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for chemical engineering process modeling, including mixing times, mixer design, and flow calculations, based on standard literature and constants.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as flow rates, diameters, velocities, and physical properties; no external data sources or network activity.",
  "sinks": "Results are returned directly; no external data or untrusted sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into mathematical calculations within each function, producing output results; no external data flows or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. Contact info and references are standard for open-source scientific code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of domain-specific mathematical functions for mixing and flow calculations, referencing authoritative literature. No external data access, network activity, or code obfuscation is present. The functions process input parameters and return calculated results. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The only minor concern is the inclusion of contact info, which is benign and typical for open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent, domain-specific utility library for chemical process modeling. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is effectively 0.",
