  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for process modeling in chemical engineering, including mixing time calculations, mixer design parameters, and Coefficient of Variation (CoV) estimations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters and imported constants (e.g., g from fluids.constants). No user input handling or external data reading present.",
  "sinks": "Performs calculations and returns numerical results. No sinks such as data leaks, network calls, file writes, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs through mathematical operations to outputs. No untrusted data handling, no command execution, and no external communications present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation detected. The code appears to be straightforward engineering calculations with proper mathematical and physical modeling. No unusual code structures, dynamic execution, or misleading variable naming observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple utility functions for chemical process calculations, including mixing times, mixer design parameters, and CoV estimations. It imports constants from external libraries, performs mathematical operations, and returns numerical results. No indications of malicious activity such as system modification, network access, or data exfiltration. The functions are well-documented and align with standard engineering practices. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate set of engineering utility functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely performs computational tasks relevant to chemical process modeling. No security concerns are identified.",
