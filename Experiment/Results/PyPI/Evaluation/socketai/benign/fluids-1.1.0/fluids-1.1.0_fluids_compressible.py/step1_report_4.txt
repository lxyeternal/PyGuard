  "purpose": "Provides various equations and functions for modeling compressible gas flow in pipelines, including calculations for pressure, flow rate, temperature, and related parameters, based on established engineering formulas.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as pressures, temperatures, diameters, flow rates, pipe lengths, and physical constants from function arguments. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Performs mathematical calculations and returns results; no data sinks or output to external systems are evident. No network, file, or environment variable access is present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed into functions; the code computes derived quantities through mathematical operations. No source-to-sink data flow involving untrusted data or external systems; computations are straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Constants are derived from referenced formulas; no hidden or misleading variables. The code strictly implements known fluid dynamics equations without suspicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of scientific functions implementing well-known equations for gas pipeline flow modeling. The constants and formulas are sourced from references and are consistent with standard engineering practices. No network calls, file I/O, or environment variable manipulations are present. The functions operate purely on numerical inputs and return calculated results, with input validation and error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code's structure and content are consistent with legitimate scientific computation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate collection of pipeline flow equations based on published formulas. There are no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage. It solely performs mathematical modeling for gas pipeline hydraulics without any suspicious behavior.",
