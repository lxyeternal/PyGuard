{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions implementing physical and empirical formulas for modeling compressible gas flow in pipelines, including pressure, temperature, flow rate, and critical flow calculations, based on well-established scientific references.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flow rates, pipe dimensions, and fluid properties; it employs numerical root-finding functions ('brenth', 'secant') and special functions ('lambertw') to solve equations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform network communication, file I/O, or external data transmission; data flows into mathematical functions and numerical solvers for computation only.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., pressures, dimensions) are processed through mathematical formulas and root-finding algorithms to compute missing parameters, with source-to-sink paths being straightforward numerical calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present; the code uses standard scientific libraries and methods without hidden or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a transparent implementation of physics-based equations for gas pipeline flow, employing standard numerical methods and special functions. It does not contain any network activity, code injection, or obfuscation. The functions are well-documented, referencing authoritative literature, and serve purely scientific purposes. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent scientific library for modeling gas flow in pipelines, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The implementation aligns with referenced literature and employs standard numerical techniques. The security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero.",
