{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for modeling pressure drops and voidage in packed beds of particles, primarily for chemical engineering applications.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external inputs or data sources dynamically; it solely uses function parameters and math operations.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or external data transmissions present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve function inputs (particle diameter, voidage, velocities, densities, etc.) being processed through mathematical formulas to produce pressure drop or voidage values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior are detected. The code consists of standard scientific computations and well-documented functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of scientific functions for pressure drop calculations in packed beds, with accompanying documentation and references. It employs standard mathematical formulas with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behavior. No external data is fetched or sent; all computations are based on provided parameters. Functions include correlation formulas from scientific literature, and the code structure is straightforward and well-commented. No suspicious or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific utility library for engineering calculations, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It is designed for use in simulations or engineering analyses, not for covert or harmful activities.",
