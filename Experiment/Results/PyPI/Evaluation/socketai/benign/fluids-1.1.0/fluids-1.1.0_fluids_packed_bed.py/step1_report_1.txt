{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for calculating pressure drops in packed beds and voidage correlations, primarily for chemical engineering process modeling.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as particle diameters, voidage, fluid velocity, density, viscosity, and tube diameters.",
  "sinks": "Calculations result in pressure drop (dP) values, but no direct data leaks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into various correlation functions (e.g., Ergun, Kuo & Nydegger, etc.) which compute pressure drops; input parameters influence the output pressure drop values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments detected. The code predominantly contains straightforward mathematical models with no obfuscated or unusual language features. No network activity, reverse shells, or data exfiltration routines present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines multiple functions calculating pressure drops based on well-established correlations. These functions only perform arithmetic operations involving input parameters, with no external data fetching or network calls. The code includes helper functions for selecting appropriate models and for calculating voidage. No malicious or sabotage code patterns, such as code injection, data leaks, or hidden backdoors, are present. The presence of email addresses and references are typical for documentation and do not suggest malicious intent. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code snippets were found; all functions are transparent in their operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard, open-source engineering utility functions for pressure drop and voidage calculations. It contains no malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The functions are purely computational with clear mathematical formulas. Overall, the code is benign and intended for scientific calculations.",
