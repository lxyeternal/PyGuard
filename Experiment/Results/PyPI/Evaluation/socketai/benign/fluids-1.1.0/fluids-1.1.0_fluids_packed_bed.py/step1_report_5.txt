{
  "purpose": "Library for calculating pressure drops and voidage in packed beds of particles, including various correlations developed for different particle shapes and packing conditions.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters for particle size, voidage, fluid properties, and dimensions; uses standard math functions (exp, pi, sqrt). No external data sources or user input reading functions are present.",
  "sinks": "Performs calculations returning pressure drops and voidage values; no data leakage, network activity, or external communication is present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through multiple correlation functions that compute pressure drop or voidage; these functions use mathematical formulas based on input parameters, with no untrusted data handling or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The code appears to be standard scientific computation code with clear purpose and no obfuscated constructs. Commented-out plotting code is benign and standard for data visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of scientific functions computing pressure drops using empirical correlations, with proper parameter usage, comments, and references. The functions use only mathematical operations and standard libraries. No network calls, file I/O, or dynamic code execution are present. The inclusion of detailed documentation, references, and example usage suggests a benign utility library. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific library for pressure drop and voidage calculations in packed beds. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage. It is purely computational with well-documented formulas. No security concerns are identified.",
