{
  "purpose": "Library providing empirical correlations for calculating pressure drop and voidage in packed beds of particles, used in chemical process modeling.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as particle diameter, voidage, fluid velocity, density, viscosity, tube diameter, and sphericity; no external data sources or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "Returns calculated pressure drops and voidage values; no untrusted data outputs or external data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Inputs such as particle diameter, voidage, fluid properties flow into various correlation functions (e.g., Ergun, Kuo & Nydegger, etc.), which compute pressure drops or voidage; no external or untrusted data flows to network or file systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or misleading code, no unusual dynamic code execution, no backdoors, no hidden data leaks, and no signs of malicious privacy violations. The code appears to be straightforward scientific calculations and empirical correlations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple empirical formulas for calculating pressure drops and voidage in packed beds, based on well-established correlations from scientific literature. It uses standard mathematical functions and straightforward parameter passing. No indications of external data sources, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior are present. The functions do not perform any network communication, file I/O, or system commands. The only notable aspect is the use of multiple empirical models, which is typical for scientific libraries. The code appears to be for open scientific use without malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a scientific utility library for empirical correlations in process modeling. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or security risks. It is well-structured, with clear parameter inputs and outputs, and adheres to typical scientific computing practices.",
