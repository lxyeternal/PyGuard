  "purpose": "Collection of empirical correlations and utility functions for calculating pressure drops and voidage in packed beds, based on scientific literature.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as particle diameter, voidage, velocity, density, viscosity, and optional tube diameter; no external data sources or dynamic data fetching.",
  "sinks": "Numerical pressure drop and voidage outputs; no data leaks, network activity, or external communications.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into mathematical formulas; outputs are computed values based solely on these inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-established empirical correlations for pressure drop and voidage, with clear documentation and no dynamic or external code execution. It relies solely on deterministic mathematical formulas with standard inputs. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, transparent collection of scientific utility functions for engineering calculations. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
