{
  "purpose": "The code provides a vectorized wrapper for functions in the 'fluids' library, allowing functions to accept iterable inputs and perform element-wise operations efficiently.",
  "sources": "The code reads module attributes from 'normal_fluids' and the 'np' object imported from 'fluids.numerics'. It also checks for the 'np' object type to determine behavior.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted user input or data. The code mainly performs module imports, type checks, and attribute assignments.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'fluids' and 'np', checking 'np' type, iterating over 'normal_fluids' attributes, vectorizing functions, and updating the global namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code uses standard Python practices. The only notable point is the conditional behavior based on 'np' being a FakePackage, but this is not suspicious per se.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports and wraps functions from the 'fluids' library with numpy's vectorize, enabling batch operations on iterable inputs. It avoids including special module attributes like '__file__' and '__name__' in the exports. The code structure and logic are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for vectorizing functions from the 'fluids' library, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign and purpose-driven module for enhancing 'fluids' functionality.",
