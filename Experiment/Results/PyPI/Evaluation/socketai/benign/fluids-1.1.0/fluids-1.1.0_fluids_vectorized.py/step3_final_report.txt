{
  "purpose": "Wraps functions from the 'fluids' library with numpy's vectorize to enable efficient batch processing of iterable inputs, facilitating process modeling utilities.",
  "sources": "Reads attributes from 'normal_fluids' module, including functions and strings; checks 'np' for 'FakePackage' status.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Imports 'fluids', inspects 'normal_fluids' attributes, conditionally wraps functions with 'np.vectorize', and updates the global namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional check 'if isinstance(np, FakePackage):' which appears to be environment handling; no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dynamic attribute inspection on 'normal_fluids', wrapping functions with numpy's vectorize for array operations. It excludes special attributes and handles a potential environment where 'np' might be a 'FakePackage'. The implementation is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. No external data inputs, network activity, or secrets are involved. The conditional check for 'FakePackage' is benign, likely for testing or compatibility. Overall, the code is a benign utility module designed for performance enhancement in scientific computations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility wrapper for 'fluids' functions with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low risk score (0 or 0.1) reflecting cautious environment handling. No modifications are necessary.",
