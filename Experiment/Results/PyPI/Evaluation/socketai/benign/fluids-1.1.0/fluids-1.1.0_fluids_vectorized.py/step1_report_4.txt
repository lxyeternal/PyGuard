{
  "purpose": "This code provides a vectorized wrapper for functions in the 'fluids' library, enabling the use of numpy's vectorize for ease of input handling in process modeling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'fluids' module and its functions via dynamic attribute access; it also imports numpy as 'np' or a FakePackage.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to send untrusted data to external systems, nor does it execute untrusted input directly; it primarily wraps existing functions.",
  "flows": "Functions from 'normal_fluids' are checked and possibly wrapped with numpy's vectorize, then stored in __all__ and __funcs, and finally injected into globals.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code dynamically imports and wraps functions in a benign manner. The use of FakePackage suggests testing or fallback, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a license and copyright notice, then imports the 'fluids' library and its numerics submodule. It defines an empty list '__all__' and a dictionary '__funcs'. It sets 'bad_names' to common special attributes. If 'np' is a 'FakePackage', it does nothing; otherwise, it dynamically inspects 'normal_fluids', wrapping functions with numpy's vectorize and skipping certain special names. The wrapped functions are stored in '__funcs' and added to the module's global namespace. This pattern is typical for creating lightweight, vectorized wrappers without any malicious operations. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module that enhances the 'fluids' library with numpy vectorization features. It dynamically imports and wraps functions for improved usability without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
