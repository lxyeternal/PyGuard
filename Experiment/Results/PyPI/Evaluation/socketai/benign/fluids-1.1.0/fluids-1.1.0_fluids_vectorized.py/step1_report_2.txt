{
  "purpose": "To provide a vectorized wrapper around the 'fluids' library functions for easier use with numpy arrays and iterables.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'fluids' library and its 'numerics' submodule; accesses functions within 'fluids'.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; code does not write untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Imports functions from 'fluids', vectorizes them, and updates the global namespace with these vectorized functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code dynamically wraps functions but does not perform any suspicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports and vectorizes functions from the 'fluids' library, storing them in the module's namespace. It handles the case when 'np' is a FakePackage, and skips certain dunder attributes. The process is straightforward and typical for creating utility modules, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. No data leakage, code injection, or suspicious network activity is present. The code is designed for performance and usability, not for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module that enhances 'fluids' library functions for vectorized use. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It appears safe, with no security risks or anomalies.",
