{
  "purpose": "Provide utilities for calculating pressure drops, friction factors, and related fluid flow properties in pipes, channels, and curved geometries, primarily for process modeling in chemical engineering applications.",
  "sources": "Input data is used for correlation calculations and empirical formulas; no external untrusted data sources or inputs are read within this code.",
  "sinks": "Calculations result in pressure drops, friction factors, and flow properties; no data is sent externally or stored maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input parameters such as Re, eD, D, Di, Dc, and others flow through various explicit formulas and functions to produce flow-related outputs; no external or untrusted data flows into the functions, and outputs are purely computed values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present. The code is straightforward, uses standard mathematical formulas, and contains no external system calls or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured with detailed functions for calculating pipe friction factors and pressure drops, including multiple empirical correlations from literature. It imports mathematical functions from standard libraries and custom modules, with no indication of malicious intent. There are no dynamic code execution, network access, or hidden behaviors. The only potentially concerning aspect is the presence of a 'fuzzy_match' utility for string matching, but it is used in context to match material names, which is benign. No data leakage, credential theft, or harmful actions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate set of scientific utility functions for fluid flow calculations in pipelines, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates solely on mathematical formulas and data for process modeling without external system interactions.",
