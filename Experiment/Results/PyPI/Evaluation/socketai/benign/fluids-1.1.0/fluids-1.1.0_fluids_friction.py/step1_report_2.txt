{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for process modeling in chemical engineering, including calculations for pipe friction factors, pressure drops, and related properties, primarily intended for flow and heat exchanger analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads environmental inputs such as Reynolds number, relative roughness, flow parameters, and pipe/material properties; it also imports external libraries like math, fluids.constants, fluids.core, and fluids.numerics for calculations.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could be inputs for functions like friction_factor, one_phase_dP, and material_roughness. These functions process inputs to produce pressure drops, friction factors, and material properties, which could influence physical system simulations or control systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (Re, eD, D, etc.) into calculation functions like friction_factor, which then produce friction coefficients; these are used further in pressure drop computations. For curved pipes, flows depend on flow regime determined by Re and transition criteria, selecting specific empirical models.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs detected. The code relies on well-known mathematical functions, external libraries, and empirical correlations. The presence of functions like 'fuzzy_match' and extensive material data appears legitimate, supporting standard engineering calculations. No obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, or misleading variable usage is present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive collection of pipe friction and pressure drop models, material roughness data, and utilities for flow calculations, including both laminar and turbulent regimes, with special considerations for curved pipes. It uses external libraries for mathematical functions and has support for extensive empirical correlations, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The code is primarily computational and data-driven, with no suspicious network activity, data leakage, or system manipulation observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured set of engineering utility functions aimed at process simulation. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident. It relies on open, well-known mathematical and physical models, and the external dependencies serve standard computational purposes.",
