{
  "purpose": "The provided code offers utility functions for fluid dynamics and pressure drop calculations in pipe flow, as well as related engineering correlations and data. It is intended for use in process modeling within chemical engineering applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as Reynolds number, relative roughness, diameter, and pipe material properties. It also accesses external libraries for special functions (e.g., mpmath, scipy LambertW) and imports physical constants from 'fluids.constants'.",
  "sinks": "The code performs calculations of friction factors, pressure drops, and flow parameters without evident data sinks that could leak or exfiltrate untrusted data. No network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows indicative of data exfiltration or malicious command execution. The mathematical functions and input parameters are used solely for engineering calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalous or suspicious code constructs are detected. All functions perform explicit calculations of physical properties and correlations. There are no hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code patterns. External library imports are standard and only used for mathematical functions. No dynamic code execution or eval statements are present. The code includes comprehensive comments and adheres to standard engineering calculation practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of scientific and engineering functions related to fluid flow, pressure drop, and pipe roughness. It uses external mathematical libraries properly, with no signs of hidden or malicious behavior. The functions perform legitimate calculations based on physics and empirical correlations. No network connections, file I/O, or obfuscated language features are detected. The code does not manipulate system resources or system calls. All operations are transparent and consistent with typical open-source scientific computation code. External dependencies are standard for numerical computations. No code injections, reverse shells, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-documented set of engineering utility functions with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It only performs physics-based calculations and data lookups for pipe roughness and pressure drops. The security risk is negligible.",
