  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source scientific utility module for calculating saltation velocities. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence scores (close to 1) and zero malware/obfuscated scores are justified based on the analysis. Overall, the code is safe, transparent, and suitable for use in engineering calculations."
