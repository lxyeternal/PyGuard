  "purpose": "Functions for calculating saltation velocity in pneumatic conveying systems based on empirical models and literature formulas.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as particle diameter, densities, flow rates, and terminal velocities; no external data sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "sinks": "No external data writing, network communication, or data exfiltration; purely computational functions returning numerical results.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into mathematical formulas; outputs are calculated velocities; no external data flows or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. Code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of physics-based empirical formulas for saltation velocity, using standard math functions and constants. No external data access or network activity. The functions are well-structured, documented, and rely solely on mathematical calculations. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. The dependencies are limited to 'math' and 'fluids.constants', both standard and safe. The code is typical for scientific utility modules, with no suspicious patterns or dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source scientific utility module for calculating saltation velocities. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence scores (close to 1) and zero malware/obfuscated scores are justified based on the analysis. Overall, the code is safe, transparent, and suitable for use in engineering calculations.",
