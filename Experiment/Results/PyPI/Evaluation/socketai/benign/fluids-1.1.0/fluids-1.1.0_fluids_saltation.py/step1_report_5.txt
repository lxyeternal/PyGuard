  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to calculate saltation velocity in pneumatic conveying based on various published correlations.",
  "sources": "Inputs include solid mass flow rate, particle size, densities, pipe diameter, and terminal velocity; these are used in mathematical calculations within functions.",
  "sinks": "Returns calculated saltation velocities; no data is sent elsewhere or stored outside the scope of functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., mp, dp, rhog, D) flow into mathematical expressions within functions, leading to computed saltation velocities; no external untrusted data flows or external systems are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious I/O observed. The email contact and GitHub link are standard for open-source projects.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of several functions implementing known empirical correlations for saltation velocity calculations. The imports are from standard Python math and a constants module, which is typical. No external network calls, file I/O, or dynamic code execution mechanisms are present. All functions perform straightforward mathematical operations with well-defined inputs and outputs. The presence of an email address and GitHub link are typical for open-source project contact info, not malicious. No suspicious code patterns or security threats are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility library for engineering calculations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely to compute saltation velocities based on physical parameters. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
