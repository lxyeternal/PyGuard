  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Functions for calculating saltation velocity; no external or untrusted data sources identified.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Pure mathematical calculations; no data exfiltration or external communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code. Uses straightforward math.\n- **Conclusion:** Code is scientific, safe, and benign.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity detected. The confidence is high (0.95), and malware/obfuscation scores are 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar purpose; input parameters are standard physical properties.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, dynamic code, or obfuscation. Clear, physics-based calculations.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate scientific utility functions.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no malware or security issues. Confidence is 1.0, malware/obfuscated scores are 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; parameters are typical for physics calculations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Straightforward formulas, no suspicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Clearly a scientific utility module, safe and benign.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity; scores align. Confidence is 1, malware/obfuscated are 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for particle velocity calculations; inputs are standard.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic features.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate scientific code, safe and straightforward.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous; no malware risk. Scores are 0.95, malware/obfuscated 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; parameters are typical physical properties.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; contact info is standard for open-source projects.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility code, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** No malware or security issues; high confidence. Scores align.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Content & Behavior:** All reports agree that the code consists of straightforward, physics-based calculations for saltation velocity, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data access.\n- **External Dependencies:** Only 'math' and 'fluids.constants' are used, both standard and safe.\n- **Potential Risks:** None detected; no network, file I/O, or dynamic code execution.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation Scores:** All are zero, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code, the risk score should be very low, close to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, given it's scientific utility code with no external data access)\n\n**Note:** The current scores in the reports (mostly 0 or 0.95/1) are reasonable, but the malware and obfuscated scores should be definitively zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a set of legitimate scientific utility functions for calculating saltation velocities in pneumatic conveying systems. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence and zero malware/obfuscated scores are justified.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the malware and obfuscated scores at 0.0, and set the overall security risk to near zero, e.g., 0.1, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
