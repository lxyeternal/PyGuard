  "purpose": "The code provides functions for calculating the saltation velocity of particles in pneumatic conveying systems based on various empirical models.",
  "sources": "Inputs include parameters such as solid mass flow rate (mp), particle diameter (dp), particle density (rhop), gas density (rhog), pipe diameter (D), gas viscosity (mug), and terminal velocity (Vterminal).",
  "sinks": "The functions perform internal calculations only; there are no explicit sinks or output flows leading to external data or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (sources) into mathematical calculations within each function, resulting in computed velocities as outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or misleading variables. The code strictly performs physics-based calculations with no hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions calculating saltation velocities based on empirical models from various references. It imports mathematical constants and functions, uses standard mathematical operations, and returns computed velocities. No suspicious patterns, external data access, or network operations are present. The functions are self-contained, with clearly documented parameters and formulas. The code appears to be straightforward scientific computation code with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of physics-based utility functions for particle velocity calculations in pneumatic conveying systems. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful operations. The code is well-structured, documented, and adheres to expected scientific computation patterns.",
