  "purpose": "Provide functions for calculating saltation velocity in pneumatic conveying based on various empirical correlations.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters for physical properties and flow conditions, but no external or untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Returns numerical calculations of saltation velocity; no data leakage or external data writing observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into mathematical formulas; no complex source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. No unusual or obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variable names. All functions perform straightforward mathematical computations based on inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple functions calculating physical parameters related to particle and gas flow velocities using established empirical formulas. The only external dependencies are 'math.sqrt' and constants 'g' and 'pi' from 'fluids.constants'. No external data is fetched, written, or manipulated in an insecure manner. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code is well-structured, with docstrings and examples, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of scientific calculation functions for saltation velocity with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on standard mathematical operations and external constants without external data sources or communication channels.",
