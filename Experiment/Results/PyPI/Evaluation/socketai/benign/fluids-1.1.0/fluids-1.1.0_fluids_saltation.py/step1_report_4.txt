  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to calculate saltation velocity of particles in pneumatic conveying systems based on various published correlations.",
  "sources": "Reads constant values from 'math' and 'fluids.constants' modules; uses input parameters such as particle size, density, flow rates, and pipe diameter.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present. The functions return numerical calculations without external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Inputs flow into mathematical calculations within functions; outputs are numerical saltation velocities. No data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or unusual language features. Documentation and comments appear standard for scientific code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines multiple functions based on scientific literature, and returns calculated physical parameters. There are no signs of code injection, network communication, or malicious activity. Usage of mathematical constants and formulas is consistent with published research. No external data is fetched or sent. The code appears to be a scientific utility module with legitimate mathematical functions for particle velocity calculations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific utility library for calculating particle saltation velocities in pneumatic systems. It does not contain any malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms. It appears safe and legitimate, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
