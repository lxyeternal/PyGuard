{
  "purpose": "Provide functions to calculate saltation velocity in pneumatic conveying systems using various empirical correlations from scientific literature.",
  "sources": "The code primarily reads input parameters such as mass flow rate, particle size, densities, pipe diameter, and terminal velocity; it does not read external input or data streams beyond function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks, network operations, or external data transmissions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters (e.g., mp, dp, rhog, D, Vterminal) through calculations and formulas; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The mathematical functions and constants are used straightforwardly, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated features, or misleading variables. No apparent code injection or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions based on scientific correlations for saltation velocity, utilizing mathematical operations, constants, and input parameters. There are no external I/O operations, no network calls, or file manipulations. The functions are explicitly documented with references and examples, indicating a legitimate scientific purpose. The only external dependency is the 'math' library for sqrt and pi, which are standard and safe. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of scientific functions for calculating saltation velocities, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any external data transmission, data collection, or harmful operations. The code appears safe and legitimate, focused on process modeling in chemical engineering.",
