{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for calculating loss coefficients of various types of filters, screens, and grills used in chemical engineering process modeling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as alpha, Re, angle, subtype, l, Dh, and fd through function parameters and internal variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any evident sinks that lead to data leaks, network activity, or system harm; it primarily performs mathematical calculations and interpolations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed into functions (sources), which perform calculations including interpolations and mathematical operations, but there are no external or untrusted data flows outside the scope of these calculations.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes standard scientific computations with interpolations; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling was observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward implementation of empirical correlations for flow resistance calculations, using known numerical methods such as interpolation and simple mathematical formulas. The interpolation functions are sourced from 'fluids.numerics' but appear to be standard functions. There are no signs of malicious payloads, external data exfiltration, or system interference. The code's structure and logic align with typical engineering utility functions, with no suspicious behavior or anomalies. No external network calls or system modifications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for engineering calculations, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is well-structured and implements standard mathematical models without suspicious behavior.",
