{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for calculating loss coefficients for various types of screens and grills used in chemical engineering process modeling.",
  "sources": "Imports from math (cos, radians), and functions from fluids.numerics (implementation_optimize_tck, interp, splev). No input data sources, user input, or external data reads present.",
  "sinks": "Calculations primarily involve mathematical interpolations and formula-based outputs. No data sinks, file writes, network communication, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (alpha, Re, angle, etc.) are processed through interpolations and formulae, resulting in return of loss coefficient values. No external untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Code uses legitimate mathematical functions and interpolation routines. No obfuscation or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of several functions computing loss coefficients based on specified parameters, employing interpolation and straightforward formulas. The interpolations use predefined tables and do not appear manipulated or malicious. The functions are well-structured, document parameters, and perform standard calculations without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or hidden behaviors. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware are detected. The code is typical for engineering utility functions, with no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for engineering calculations. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are identified. It is safe for use in production or analysis contexts.",
