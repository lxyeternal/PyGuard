  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for calculating loss coefficients of various types of screens, meshes, and grills used in process modeling within chemical engineering applications.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as alpha, Re, angle, l, Dh, fd; uses functions like interp and splev from the fluids.numerics library.",
  "sinks": "Calculations based on input parameters, no evident data leakage or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (alpha, Re, angle, l, Dh, fd) are used in interpolation and mathematical calculations to produce loss coefficients.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. Uses external numerical libraries for interpolation. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. No hidden network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple functions that calculate loss coefficients for different types of screens and grills based on empirical correlations. It performs numerical interpolation and basic mathematical operations. The functions accept parameters such as open area fraction, Reynolds number, angles, and physical dimensions. The use of external libraries for interpolation and evaluation is standard. No code suggests malicious intent; no suspicious data handling, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated logic, and no hidden network activity. The module appears to be a typical scientific utility library for process modeling without malicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility library for calculating process-related loss coefficients. It contains no malicious behavior or malware, and no security risks are evident. It solely performs numerical calculations based on input parameters. The overall security risk is negligible.",
