  "purpose": "Utility functions for calculating flow loss coefficients in pipes and channels, based on empirical correlations and interpolations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as alpha, Re, angle, subtype, l, Dh, fd; data tables for interpolation.",
  "sinks": "Internal calculations; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through interpolations and formulas within the functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard empirical correlations for flow resistance, using known numerical routines from 'fluids.numerics'. It performs interpolations and mathematical calculations typical for engineering utility functions. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious code is present. The code is well-structured, documented, and relies on established scientific libraries. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for process modeling in chemical engineering. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
