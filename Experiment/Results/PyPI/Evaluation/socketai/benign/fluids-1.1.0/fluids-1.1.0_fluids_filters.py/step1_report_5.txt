{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for process modeling in chemical engineering, specifically for calculating loss coefficients of various types of filters and screens.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as alpha, Re, angles, and optional parameters like l, Dh, fd; it also imports functions from 'fluids.numerics'.",
  "sinks": "The code performs mathematical calculations and interpolations based on input data, with no apparent untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions which perform calculations and interpolations; no external data or untrusted inputs are sent to network or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code is straightforward scientific calculation code. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variables are present. No signs of data leakage or privacy violations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several functions for calculating loss coefficients based on empirical data tables, using interpolations and mathematical formulas. It uses standard mathematical and interpolation functions imported from 'fluids.numerics'. The data tables are hardcoded and used for lookup and interpolation. The functions handle optional parameters and include error handling for unknown subtypes. There is no external network activity, file I/O, or suspicious behavior. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific utility module for process modeling with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It performs interpolations and calculations based on input parameters, consistent with engineering calculations. There are no indications of sabotage, backdoors, or data exfiltration. Overall security risk is very low.",
