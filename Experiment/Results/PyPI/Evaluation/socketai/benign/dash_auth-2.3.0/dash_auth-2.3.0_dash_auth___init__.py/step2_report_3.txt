  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code is a straightforward module that imports various components related to authentication, authorization, and routing, and defines an `__all__` list for public API exposure.\n- The only dynamic behavior is the conditional import of `.oidc_auth` inside a try-except block, which is a common pattern for optional dependencies.\n- There are no functions executing untrusted input, no external commands, no data leaks, or suspicious data flows.\n\n**Conclusion:** There are no malicious issues or security vulnerabilities present in the code snippet itself.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code performs static imports, handles optional dependencies gracefully, and does not execute untrusted data or external commands.\n- The reports uniformly recognize that the code is a benign module setup for a package, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The reasoning is consistent, and no logical flaws are evident.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the analysis.\n- Confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), reflecting strong certainty that the code is benign.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- No issues in the code justify a risk score above 0.5; the code is static, safe, and does not perform any risky operations.\n- The optional import pattern is standard and does not introduce security concerns.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any claims based on assumptions**\n\n- The reports do not assume malicious intent; they only describe the static import pattern.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are made; the analysis is consistent with the code.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure scores are consistent with the report**\n\n- The assigned scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.\n- Confidence levels are appropriate, given the static and benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured module setup for a Python package.\n- The optional dependency handling is common and does not introduce security concerns.\n- There are no hidden behaviors, data leaks, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThis code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports' evaluations are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0              |\n\n**Recommendation:** No further action needed; the code is safe.",
