{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various authentication and route management functions for a web application or API, and defines its public API surface.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules such as public_routes, basic_auth, group_protection, oidc_auth, and version. These are static import statements with conditional import for optional dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling; no user input processing, network calls, or file system operations observed.",
  "flows": "The code only imports functions and variables; no data flow or untrusted data processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of OIDCAuth and get_oauth based on the presence of the module suggests optional dependency handling but not malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The module imports various authentication and route-related functions from local modules, with a conditional import for an optional OIDC authentication module. It then defines a __all__ list for public API exposure. There are no dynamic code execution, data handling, or external network operations present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import and API declaration snippet with no signs of malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks detected. It appears to serve as part of a larger web application framework, exposing certain functions and classes for external use.",
