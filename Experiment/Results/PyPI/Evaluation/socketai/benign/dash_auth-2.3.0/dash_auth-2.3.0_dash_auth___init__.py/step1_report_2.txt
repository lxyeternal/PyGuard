{
  "purpose": "This module appears to serve as an aggregation point for various authentication and authorization functionalities, importing and exposing different methods and classes related to security, such as public routes, basic authentication, group protection, and OIDC authentication.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.public_routes, .basic_auth, .group_protection, .oidc_auth, .version). These are static imports; no external or untrusted input is read.",
  "sinks": "Exports of functions and classes; no direct data sinks such as network connections or file writes are present. No indication of data leakage or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports and re-exports functions and classes; there are no data flows, user inputs, or untrusted data processing happening within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of .oidc_auth suggests optional dependency handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The comment hints at optional OIDC auth requiring an external library but does not perform any malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a module initializer that imports various components related to authentication and authorization. It handles optional dependencies gracefully. There are no signs of malicious code, such as hidden network activities, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. All operations are static and limited to module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward aggregation module for authentication functionalities with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks identified. It appears safe based on the provided content.",
