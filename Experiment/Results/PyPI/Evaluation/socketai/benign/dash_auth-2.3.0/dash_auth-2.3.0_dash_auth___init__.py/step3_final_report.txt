{
  "purpose": "This code module imports various authentication and routing components, with an optional dependency for OIDC authentication, and defines the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, including the optional import of .oidc_auth within a try-except block.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "The conditional import of .oidc_auth is standard for optional dependencies, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup for a Python package, with static imports and an __all__ list. No dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code are present. The optional import pattern is common and safe. All signals indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package module with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
