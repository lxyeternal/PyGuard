{
  "purpose": "This module imports various authentication and routing functions for a web application, likely for setting up security mechanisms such as public routes, basic auth, group protection, and OIDC authentication.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.public_routes, .basic_auth, .group_protection, .oidc_auth, .version); dynamic import of .oidc_auth if available.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly. The code only imports functions and variables; no data processing or untrusted input handling occurs here.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input. The code dynamically imports optional modules, which is benign unless the imported modules themselves contain malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The dynamic import of '.oidc_auth' conditioned on ModuleNotFoundError is common and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard import and export pattern for a Python package, with optional import handling for 'oidc_auth'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The presence of a try-except block for optional module loading is typical for optional dependencies. The overall structure and content suggest a legitimate package setup with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module setup file with no malicious behavior. It imports necessary functions for authentication and routing, with an optional import for OIDC support. There are no anomalies, no malicious code, and no security concerns.",
