  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports various modules related to authentication, authorization, and routing.\n- Uses a try-except block to conditionally import `.oidc_auth` if available.\n- Defines an `__all__` list to specify the public API.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and performs expected import operations.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or harmful actions.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities such as hardcoded secrets or insecure patterns are present.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, not obfuscated.\n- **Data flow or external input:** No such flows are present.\n- **Suspicious anomalies:** The conditional import of `.oidc_auth` is standard for optional dependencies, not suspicious.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical flaws are evident. The code is a typical module setup for a Python package.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or very close to it, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Potential Issues or Overestimations:\n- No report suggests any behavior that warrants a higher risk score.\n- The optional import pattern is common and not inherently risky.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code's nature. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe module setup for a Python package, with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
