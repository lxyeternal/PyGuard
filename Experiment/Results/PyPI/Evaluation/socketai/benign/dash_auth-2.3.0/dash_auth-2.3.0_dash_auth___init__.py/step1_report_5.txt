{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various authentication and authorization components, as well as version information, to be used in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .public_routes, .basic_auth, .group_protection, .oidc_auth, and .version.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction visible.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only performs static imports and defines __all__, with conditional import of oidc_auth.",
  "anomalies": "The conditional import of .oidc_auth, which is only attempted if the module is present; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports functions and classes from internal modules and manages the module's __all__ exports. The only dynamic element is the optional import of .oidc_auth, which handles the potential absence of the module without crashing. No data input, no external connections, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The code structure is standard for a Python package module setup, with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical import and export setup for a package, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign module configuration.",
