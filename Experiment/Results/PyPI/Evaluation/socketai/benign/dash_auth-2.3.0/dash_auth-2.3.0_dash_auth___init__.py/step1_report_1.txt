{
  "purpose": "This code module imports various components related to authentication, authorization, and routing for a web application, and defines an export list for these components.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules (.public_routes, .basic_auth, .group_protection, .oidc_auth, .version) and conditional import of .oidc_auth if available.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no execution of untrusted input or external commands; no data leaks or harmful actions directly initiated.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flow; the code primarily imports modules and assigns them to __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of .oidc_auth depending on ModuleNotFoundError; no sensitive data handling or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly performs import operations, including a try-except block to optionally include OIDC authentication if available. It defines a list of exports for use elsewhere. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution present. The conditional import suggests a flexible dependency management but does not pose a security concern. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a Python package, focused on importing and exposing components related to authentication and routing. It does not contain any malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security risks based on this fragment.",
