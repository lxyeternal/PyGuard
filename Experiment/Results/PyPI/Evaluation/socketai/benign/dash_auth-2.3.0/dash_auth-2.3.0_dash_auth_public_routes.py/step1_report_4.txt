  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for managing public routes and callbacks in a Dash web application, including adding routes and defining public callbacks.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (DASH_PUBLIC_ASSETS_EXTENSIONS), get_app(), get_public_routes(), get_public_callbacks(), inspect.getsource() for callback functions, and app.server.config.",
  "sinks": "Adding routes via Route objects, modifying app.server.config entries, and using callback ID mapping for public callbacks.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and get_app() input -> route addition to app.server.config -> callback decoration and registration -> modification of callback whitelist in config.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Uses environment variables securely, no external network connections or data exfiltration observed. The callback registration process relies on inspecting source code for matching functions, which is standard but could potentially be misused if source inspection is manipulated. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages route and callback whitelisting in a Dash app, with functions to add public routes and register callbacks as public. It reads environment variables securely for asset extensions, uses standard Dash and Flask mechanisms for route management, and maintains callback whitelists. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data theft, backdoors, or network communication. The callback wrapping uses inspect.getsource() for identifying callbacks, which is standard and unlikely malicious, though slightly unusual. Overall, the code appears benign, focusing on route and callback management, with no security issues or malware detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements route and callback whitelisting for a Dash application without any indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on standard libraries and practices, with no suspicious network activity, data leakage, or backdoors. It is considered safe.",
