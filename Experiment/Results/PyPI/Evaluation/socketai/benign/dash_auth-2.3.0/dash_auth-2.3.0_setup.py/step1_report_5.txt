{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'dash_auth' Python package, primarily used to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'dash_auth/version.py' to extract version information; reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data being written or executed in a way that leads to potential harm.",
  "flows": "The version info from 'version.py' is read and executed to populate 'main_ns', then used in the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'exec' to run the contents of 'version.py' could be risky if the file content is malicious, but in standard practice, it's used to import version info. No other suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures: importing 'setuptools', reading version info via 'exec', and reading a Markdown file for description. The 'exec' call is a potential concern but is common in setup scripts for importing version info from a file. No user input, network activity, or other malicious patterns detected. The dependencies and metadata are typical for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script with minimal risk. The only minor concern is the use of 'exec' to load version data, which could be exploited if the 'version.py' file were maliciously altered, but this is a common pattern in packaging scripts. No malicious behavior or malicious code detected.",
