  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'dash_auth' Python package, including reading version information and long description from files.",
  "sources": "Reading 'dash_auth/version.py' for version info; reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; setup parameters are static or derived from trusted files.",
  "flows": "Read version file -> assign to main_ns -> pass to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute contents of 'version.py', which can be risky if the file contents are malicious or tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup configuration for a Python package, reading version info via exec() which can be dangerous if 'version.py' is compromised, as exec() executes arbitrary code. The rest of the code reads a markdown file and supplies static package configuration parameters. No network or secret handling is involved. The use of exec() is a potential security concern but is common in setup scripts; unless the 'version.py' file is malicious, this does not constitute malicious behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with a potential risk associated with executing external files via exec(). This is a known pattern but can be exploited if 'version.py' is malicious. No malicious behavior or malware is evident. Overall security risk is low if 'version.py' is trusted.",
