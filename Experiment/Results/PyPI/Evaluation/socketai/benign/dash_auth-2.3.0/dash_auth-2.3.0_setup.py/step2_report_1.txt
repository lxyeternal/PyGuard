  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same setup script for the 'dash_auth' package.\n- The primary concern raised is the use of `exec()` to load version information from 'dash_auth/version.py'.\n- No reports identify actual malicious code, network activity, or malicious behaviors.\n- The reports agree that the setup script is standard, with `exec()` being a common but potentially risky pattern if the version file is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **Use of `exec()` to load version info**: This pattern is common but can be risky if 'dash_auth/version.py' is malicious or tampered with. However, no evidence of malicious content in the version file is provided.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Potential security concern**: The use of `exec()` is a known vulnerability if the version file is compromised. While it's standard in many setup scripts, it warrants caution.\n- **No actual malicious code** present in the provided code snippets.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Malware score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0, which is appropriate; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score**: Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security risk, primarily due to `exec()` usage.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- The risk scores are all below 0.5, indicating low risk. Given the absence of malicious code and no network activity, this is appropriate.\n- The only concern is the use of `exec()`, which could be exploited if the version file is malicious, but this is a known pattern and does not inherently indicate malicious intent.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports correctly note that `exec()` can be risky if the version file is compromised, but they do not assume malicious content; they only highlight the potential risk.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, no obfuscation, low security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score**: 0.2 (low, due to `exec()` pattern but no actual malicious activity)\n\n### Recommendations:\n- To improve security, consider replacing the `exec()` pattern with safer alternatives, such as importing the version directly or reading and parsing the version string without executing code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard setup script with a common pattern for version loading. No malicious activity is evident. The primary concern is the use of `exec()`, which is a known security risk if the version file is compromised, but in a trusted environment, this risk is minimal.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis reflects a safe, typical setup script with a minor caution regarding `exec()`.",
