{
  "purpose": "To configure and set up the 'dash_auth' Python package by reading version information, description, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'dash_auth/version.py' for version info; reading 'README.md' for long description; static code in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None apparent. No untrusted data processing or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A — all data is static or read from files at setup time, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'exec' to run contents of 'version.py' is a notable pattern, but common in package setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup, reads version info from a file using 'exec', and reads a README file for description. The setup() function specifies package metadata and dependencies. No untrusted data inputs, network activity, or obfuscated code detected. The use of 'exec' is typical for dynamic version retrieval but should be noted; however, it does not appear malicious. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or malware indicators identified.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious or security-threatening code present. The use of 'exec' for version loading is common and not inherently malicious, especially given the context. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
