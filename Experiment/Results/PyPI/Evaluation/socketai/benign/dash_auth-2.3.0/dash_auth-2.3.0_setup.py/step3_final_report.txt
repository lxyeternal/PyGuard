  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'dash_auth' Python package, loading version info and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'dash_auth/version.py' for version info, 'README.md' for description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data leaks involved.",
  "flows": "Reads version.py content via exec(), then passes data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info; no malicious code detected, but potential risk if 'version.py' is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with a common pattern of loading version info via exec(). No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The use of exec() is a known pattern but can be risky if the version file is malicious. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with the main concern being the exec() pattern. No evidence of malicious intent or sabotage is found. The risk is minimal if the version.py file is trusted. The code's structure and content are straightforward, and no anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is standard and safe, with a minor security concern regarding the use of exec() to load version info. No malicious activity or sabotage is evident. The low risk score is appropriate, assuming the version.py file is secure. Overall, the code is benign, and the security posture is acceptable with standard precautions.",
