  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'dash_auth' Python package, including reading version info and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'dash_auth/version.py' for version information, reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code performs standard setup procedures without executing untrusted code or data.",
  "flows": "Reads version file -> executes its content -> uses the data in setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "Uses exec() to execute the contents of 'dash_auth/version.py', which can be risky if the file is compromised. Otherwise, standard setup process.",
  "analysis": "The code reads the version information dynamically by executing a Python file, which could be malicious if the file is tampered with, but this is a common pattern for version management. No other suspicious code or malicious behavior detected. No user input, network access, or sensitive data handling is present. The setup process is standard and does not involve untrusted data sources or execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical package setup with a potentially risky exec() call to load version info, which is a known pattern but can be exploited if the version file is malicious. No malicious intent or malware detected. The overall security risk is low, but the use of exec() warrants caution.",
