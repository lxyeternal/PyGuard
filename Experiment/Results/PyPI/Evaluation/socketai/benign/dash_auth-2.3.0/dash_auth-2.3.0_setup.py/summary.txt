  "conclusion": "The setup script is standard and safe, with a minor security concern regarding the use of exec() to load version info. No malicious activity or sabotage is evident. The low risk score is appropriate, assuming the version.py file is secure. Overall, the code is benign, and the security posture is acceptable with standard precautions."
