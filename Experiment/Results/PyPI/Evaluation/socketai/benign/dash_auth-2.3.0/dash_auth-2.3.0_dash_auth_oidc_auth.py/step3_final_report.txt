{
  "purpose": "Implements OAuth2/OpenID Connect authentication for Dash applications, managing provider registration, login, logout, and callback flows.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (for HTTPS enforcement), request headers (host info), URL parameters (idp), session storage (user info, tokens), function parameters (routes, provider info).",
  "sinks": "Redirects (authorize, callback), session modifications (user info, tokens), response rendering (logout page).",
  "flows": "Input from environment headers and URL params → validation and route handling → OAuth client authorization and token exchange → session storage of user data → redirects to app or logout page.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets; code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard OAuth/OIDC flows, validates route placeholders, manages sessions securely, and uses environment variables appropriately. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. The environment-dependent HTTPS enforcement is a configuration detail, not a vulnerability. The session security settings are optional but correctly implemented if enabled. No logical flaws or security flaws are evident; the code is a typical, well-structured implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure OAuth/OIDC integration for Dash apps, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is zero. The scores are consistent with the analysis.",
