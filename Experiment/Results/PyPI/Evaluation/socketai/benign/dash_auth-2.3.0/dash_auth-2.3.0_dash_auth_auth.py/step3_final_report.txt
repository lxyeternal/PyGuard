  "purpose": "Provides an abstract base class for route protection in Dash applications, intercepting requests to enforce authentication and public route access control.",
  "sources": "request.path, request.get_json()",
  "sinks": "login_request(), is_authorized()",
  "flows": "request.path and callback body data flow to authorization checks and public route validation",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Flask request hooks to enforce route security, relying on external functions for route management. It contains no malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation. The external functions are assumed safe. The logic is straightforward, checking route/public callback status before invoking authorization or login procedures. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present; the code aligns with common security practices for Dash apps.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard route protection mechanism with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the correctness of external functions and implementations of abstract methods. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low but standard security considerations.",
