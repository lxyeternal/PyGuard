  "purpose": "Test functions for Flask session management, group permissions, and access control decorators from dash_auth.",
  "sources": "Session data set within Flask test request contexts.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data handling; purely internal test assertions.",
  "flows": "Session data assigned in tests → permission functions and decorators evaluate based on session state.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests manipulating Flask session data to verify permission functions and decorators. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or external data handling are present. The functions from dash_auth are assumed standard. The code is benign, with no signs of supply chain attack vectors or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for Flask session and permission logic, with no malicious or security issues detected. The scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
