  "purpose": "This code contains test functions for Flask-based session management and group permission checks using the dash_auth library.",
  "sources": "Session data (user info) set within Flask test request contexts.",
  "sinks": "Session manipulation, function returns based on session data, Flask context handling.",
  "flows": "Session data (user info) flows from test setup to protected function checks, influencing access control outcomes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets beyond a simple secret key. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior observed. No external network activity or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines test cases for session handling, group checking, and access control via Flask's session and dash_auth functions. Session data is explicitly set within test request contexts, and function outputs are asserted accordingly. No input from external sources or untrusted data streams are present; all data is controlled within tests. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious actions are detected. The use of a fixed secret key is typical for testing environments and not malicious. The code strictly tests intended functionality without any malicious intent or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard test suite for Flask session and authorization functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and non-malicious.",
