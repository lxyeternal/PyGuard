  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of OAuth/OIDC authentication flows with multiple providers and testing routines. No malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain threats are evident. The security risk is low, mainly related to placeholder secrets used in testing. The scores are justified: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk ≈ 0.2."
