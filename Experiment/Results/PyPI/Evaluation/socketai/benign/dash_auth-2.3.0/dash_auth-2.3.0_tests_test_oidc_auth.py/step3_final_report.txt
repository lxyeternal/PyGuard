  "purpose": "Implementation of OAuth/OIDC authentication flows within a Dash application, including login, logout, multi-provider support, and associated testing routines.",
  "sources": "User input via 'input' components, URL requests to the app, patched functions simulating OAuth redirects and token exchanges.",
  "sinks": "Redirect responses, HTTP responses from requests, and callback outputs updating UI components.",
  "flows": "User input triggers callbacks; OAuth redirect functions are patched to simulate success or failure; requests to login/logout URLs initiate OAuth flows; responses update UI components accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholders for secrets and client IDs; testing patches for OAuth functions; no hardcoded real secrets or malicious URL manipulations; code is straightforward and test-oriented.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard OAuth/OIDC flows with multiple providers and testing patches. No hardcoded secrets beyond placeholders, no suspicious URL manipulations, and no malicious code or backdoors are present. The use of patches and placeholders indicates test scaffolding rather than production secrets. The code's structure and behavior are typical for OAuth/OIDC testing scenarios. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to placeholder secrets, which is common in test environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the test setup with placeholders.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of OAuth/OIDC authentication flows with multiple providers and testing routines. No malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain threats are evident. The security risk is low, mainly related to placeholder secrets used in testing. The scores are justified: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk ≈ 0.2.",
