  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static string to the `__version__` variable. There are no sources, sinks, data flows, or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal and standard for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly state that there are no security concerns, no obfuscation, and no malicious intent. No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0\n\n   These scores seem appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is just a straightforward version string assignment, there is no reason to assign a higher risk score. The reports' scores of 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they only describe what the code does.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious elements are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risk associated with this minimal version declaration.\n\n**Overall**, the reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Given the minimal and benign nature of this code snippet, no further security concerns are warranted.\n- If this pattern appears in larger codebases, it remains safe unless combined with other suspicious code elsewhere.\n\n**Summary**:  \nAll reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard version declaration with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
