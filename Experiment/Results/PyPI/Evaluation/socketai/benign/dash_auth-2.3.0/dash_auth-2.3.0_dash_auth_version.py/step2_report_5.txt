  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content and Actual Risks:**\n   - The code snippet is: `__version__ = '2.3.0'`.\n   - This is a standard practice in Python packages to declare the version.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - No obfuscation, no dynamic code, no suspicious constructs.\n   - The code is minimal and benign.\n\n2. **Assessment of Each Report:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code being clear.\n   - Malware scores are 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n3. **Potential Issues in the Reports:**\n   - The reports do not identify any actual issues, which is accurate.\n   - They seem to be overly cautious, but given the code's simplicity, this is acceptable.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent that are unsupported.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - Since the code is a simple version string assignment, the malware score should remain 0.\n   - The obfuscated score is correctly 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score should be 0, reflecting no security concern.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - All reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No adjustments needed based on the code's nature.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks associated with this code snippet.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
