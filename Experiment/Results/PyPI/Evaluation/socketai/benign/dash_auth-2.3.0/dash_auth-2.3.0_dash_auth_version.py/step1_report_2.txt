  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Simple assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code complexity, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; only a version string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to the __version__ variable, which is standard in Python packages. There are no inputs, no dynamic code execution, no use of environment variables, and no external data handling. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for defining package version information. No malicious behavior detected.",
