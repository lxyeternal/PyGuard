  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no sources, sinks, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - No obfuscation, code complexity, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, such as code execution, data exfiltration, or hidden payloads.\n\n2. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign and standard for version declaration.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malware Score:**\n   - Since the code is just a straightforward version string assignment, the malware score should be 0.\n   - The security risk score should also be 0, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume the code is only for version declaration, which is accurate.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious intent are made, which is correct given the code.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and match the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code snippet is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
