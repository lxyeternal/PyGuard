  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a straightforward SDK module with no dynamic code, data processing, or network activity. The only unusual aspect is the copyright year 2025, which is inconsistent with the training data cutoff but not malicious.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No logical errors or malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 seems reasonable given the minimal concern about the future date, which is likely a typo or placeholder.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns; the code is a standard SDK interface.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, a typical SDK interface with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious or security risks.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Again, a standard module with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 is suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern; no suspicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Consistent with previous reports, a standard SDK setup.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 is fitting.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code behavior:** All reports describe a static, well-structured SDK interface module.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Risk scores:** All are reasonable, with the only minor point being the future copyright date, which is not malicious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 at most for the first report due to the future date; otherwise, 0.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the unusual date, but not a security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The minor anomaly (future copyright year) does not warrant a higher risk score.",
