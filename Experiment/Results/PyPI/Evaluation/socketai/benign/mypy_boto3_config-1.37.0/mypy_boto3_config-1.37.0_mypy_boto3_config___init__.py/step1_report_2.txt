  "purpose": "To provide an interface and access points for the AWS Config service client and related paginators in Python.",
  "sources": "Import statements for client and paginator modules, constant definitions, and docstring for usage instructions.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is being sent to external endpoints or untrusted sources within this code.",
  "flows": "N/A — The code mainly defines imports, constants, and documentation without processing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward, with standard Python module and class definitions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, class aliasing, and a detailed docstring providing usage instructions. It imports client and paginator modules, defines a client alias, and exports these as part of the module's __all__ variable. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of sensitive data within this snippet. The code appears to be a typical SDK interface layer for AWS services, with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard interface module for AWS Config service clients and paginators. It contains no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security flaws. It serves as a straightforward wrapper, with no suspicious activities detected.",
