  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a straightforward SDK interface, importing classes and defining constants.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data is sent or received; mainly module setup.\n- **Anomalies:** The only unusual point is the copyright year 2025, which is inconsistent with the training data cutoff but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues detected. The code is standard for an SDK module.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** The report assigns a low security risk (0.1) and malware score (0). This seems appropriate given the content.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is an interface layer with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, risk is 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, the code is a simple module exporting classes and defining an alias.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0, consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Focuses on documentation and class exports, no dynamic code or external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0, appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar findings: module setup, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:** None detected. All reports correctly identify that the code is an SDK interface module with no dynamic execution, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted data.\n- **Obfuscation & Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The only anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- **Scores Justification:** The malware scores are all 0, which is justified. The risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very minimal, mainly due to the future copyright date)\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the scores provided. The code is a standard SDK interface with no security concerns.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The code is safe and benign from a security perspective.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate; the code shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor point is the future copyright year, which is likely a placeholder.",
