{
  "purpose": "Defines the main interface for a configuration service SDK, exporting classes and paginators for AWS config interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), constants, and string definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external network operations; primarily module and class definitions, with no data processing or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code mainly imports, defines constants, and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The copyright date is 2025, which is inconsistent with the training cutoff, but this alone is not suspicious. The code structure is typical for SDK modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions from local modules, defines a Client alias, and lists exported symbols. There is no code execution, user input handling, or network activity. The purpose appears to be straightforward SDK setup. No obfuscation or malicious logic detected. The copyright date is unusual but not malicious. No anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module definition for a Python SDK related to AWS Config service. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The only noteworthy point is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not a security concern.",
