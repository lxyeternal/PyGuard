{
  "purpose": "To serve as an interface for the AWS Config service, providing access to various paginators and client classes for interacting with AWS Config.",
  "sources": "The code imports data from local modules (.client and .paginator) which are assumed to be part of the package; no external or untrusted sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns class references to variables, defines the __all__ list for exports, and sets a Client alias, none of which are typically security-sensitive sinks; no data leaks or malicious actions are observed.",
  "flows": "The code flow is limited to importing classes, defining an alias, and exporting them, with no dynamic data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code. No dynamic execution, network activity, or unusual patterns. All imports and definitions are standard for a package interface.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module for organizing and exporting classes related to the AWS Config service. It imports classes from local modules, re-exports them, and creates an alias for the client class. The structure and content are typical for SDK interface modules. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected. There are no external inputs, secret handling, or network communications in this snippet. The copyright statement and documentation link appear benign and are common in open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple interface layer with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard pattern for SDK wrappers. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are present in this code fragment.",
