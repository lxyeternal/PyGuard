{
  "purpose": "Defines and exports a client and multiple paginator classes for interacting with AWS Config service, facilitating paginated data retrieval.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), and inline string documentation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; code mainly defines class and constant exports.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted data sources to sensitive functions or outputs; no data flow from inputs to outputs that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a lengthy docstring with usage examples; no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module imports, class and constant definitions, and a comprehensive documentation string. It does not execute any untrusted data, perform network operations, or include any hidden or malicious payloads. All imported modules are local and related to the AWS Config service, and no external or dynamic input is processed or evaluated. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code is structured as an SDK interface with explicit exports, which is typical for a library package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK module setup with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected. It merely exposes classes and constants for AWS Config interactions. No malicious activity or supply chain sabotage appears present.",
