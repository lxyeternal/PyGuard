{
  "purpose": "Provides a main interface for AWS Config SDK, exporting classes and paginators for use in client code.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules, class and function definitions, constants, and documentation strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or external data sources; purely module setup.",
  "flows": "Import of classes and functions, exporting symbols; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year 2025 is suspicious as it is in the future relative to the training data cutoff, likely a placeholder or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface module, importing classes and defining exports. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data is present. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year, which does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a placeholder. Overall, the supply chain security risk is negligible.",
