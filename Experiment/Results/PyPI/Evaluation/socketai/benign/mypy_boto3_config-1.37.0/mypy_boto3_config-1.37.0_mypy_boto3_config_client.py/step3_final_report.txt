  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for AWS Config SDK, auto-generated for static type safety and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Method signatures, type definitions, and overloads for paginators, primarily reading method parameters and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, network calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Method calls with parameters, no runtime data flow or external data handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a static SDK interface with no suspicious patterns or embedded malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations, class definitions, and method signatures for the AWS Config boto3 client, including overloads for paginators. It contains no executable logic, network activity, or data handling beyond method signatures. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The high risk scores in the reports are unwarranted; the code is purely static, intended for type safety and IDE support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated SDK stub with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks. It is safe and serves solely as a static interface for AWS Config interactions.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
