{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for AWS Config service, providing structured interfaces for API calls and pagination.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions with parameters and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations with parameters unpacked from request types; no untrusted data sinks, network calls, or file operations are directly present.",
  "flows": "Method parameters (unpacked request types) lead into API call definitions, with no data processing or transmission code shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. The code is primarily interface and type annotation definitions, with no executable logic or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type annotations, class definitions, and method signatures for AWS Config client, including overloaded paginator methods. It is generated and structured to match AWS SDK patterns, with detailed docstrings referencing official documentation. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform data processing, network requests, or system modifications, indicating it is a safe type stub implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of type annotations and client interface definitions for AWS Config, designed for type safety and IDE support. It contains no malicious logic or malicious behavior indicators. The code is legitimate and intended for use as a library interface.",
