  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, following the step-by-step instructions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Error:** \"Empty response\" with raw_response \"\" — indicates no actual runtime data or network activity is shown.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** The report notes that the code is primarily type annotations and interface definitions, with no executable logic, data processing, or network calls.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.0 (confidently high, but is that justified?)\n- **Justification:** The code is a stub/interface for AWS SDK, with no malicious code, no obfuscated patterns, and no runtime behavior. The high risk score seems unwarranted; it's purely static type annotations.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe; the high risk score is unreasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as type annotations and class definitions for AWS Config SDK.\n- **Analysis:** The report emphasizes that the code is a structured, auto-generated SDK wrapper, with no suspicious behaviors, data handling, or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 (not explicitly, but implied as low to moderate)\n- **Justification:** The code is purely interface definitions with no runtime logic or data transmission. The risk score should be low, possibly 0.0 or 0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware or obfuscation; the risk score should be minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous, type annotations and structured interface for AWS Config.\n- **Analysis:** The code is auto-generated, with extensive overloads for paginators, no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no data exfiltration.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 (again, not explicitly but inferred)\n- **Justification:** The code is a static SDK stub with no runtime or malicious behavior. The risk score should be near zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with a very low risk score appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as SDK interface with method signatures, type annotations.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malicious data handling. It’s a standard SDK wrapper.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.0 (again, high)\n- **Justification:** The high risk score is unjustified; static interface code with no runtime behavior or malicious intent. The risk should be minimal.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware or sabotage; risk score should be near zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar description as above, SDK interface for AWS Config.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no data leaks. The code is purely type annotations and method signatures.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.0 (again, unwarranted)\n- **Justification:** The code is static interface definitions, with no runtime or malicious behavior. The risk score should be very low.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with a minimal risk profile.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify that the code contains no malicious behavior. **0.0** is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear, auto-generated SDK stubs with no obfuscation. **0.0**.\n- **Risk score:** The reports assign high risk scores (0.5 or 1.0) based on static code analysis, but since the code is purely type annotations and interface definitions, the actual security risk is negligible.\n\n**Therefore, I recommend the following:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0.0** — no security risk, as the code is static SDK interface.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The high risk scores assigned in the reports are unwarranted given the static, interface-only nature of the code. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns are present.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Recommended Score |\n|--------------------|-------------------|\n| Malware            | 0.0               |\n| Obfuscated         | 0.0               |\n| Security Risk      | 0.0               |\n\nThis concludes the review.",
