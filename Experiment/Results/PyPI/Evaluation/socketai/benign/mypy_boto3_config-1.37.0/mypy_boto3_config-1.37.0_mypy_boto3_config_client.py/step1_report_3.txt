{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the boto3 ConfigService client, enabling type-safe interactions with AWS Config.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class and method definitions; type overloads for paginators.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that invoke AWS Config operations, including paginated operations and presigned URL generation.",
  "flows": "Method signatures accepting kwargs (untrusted data), calling AWS APIs, returning responses or paginator objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, class definitions, and method signatures for a boto3 client with extensive use of type overloads. All functions delegate to AWS services via documented SDK calls, with no evidence of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious data handling. The inclusion of detailed docstrings referencing official documentation and the absence of suspicious operations or hidden behaviors suggest this is a standard SDK wrapper for type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured type stub for the AWS Config boto3 client, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It is designed to provide type annotations and facilitate SDK usage, not to perform any harmful actions.",
