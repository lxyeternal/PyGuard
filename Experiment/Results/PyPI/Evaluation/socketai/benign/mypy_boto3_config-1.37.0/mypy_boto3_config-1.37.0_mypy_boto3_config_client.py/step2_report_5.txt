  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\nReport 1:\n- **Error:** \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.\n- **Analysis:** The report states that the code is purely type annotations and interface definitions for AWS Config, with no executable logic, network calls, or data processing. It notes no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a comprehensive type stub for the AWS SDK, with no signs of malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\nReport 2:\n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as a type-safe, interface-focused implementation for AWS Config, mainly for IDE support and static typing.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. It mainly delegates to AWS SDK calls with detailed type annotations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\nReport 3:\n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous, emphasizing structured, type-annotated client class for AWS Config.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no malicious code, no obfuscation. The code appears auto-generated for SDK type hints.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\nReport 4:\n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as a client interface with methods for AWS Config.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, no embedded secrets, no obfuscation. It is a typical SDK interface with type annotations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\nReport 5:\n- **Purpose:** Reiterates the code as a type-safe SDK interface.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no suspicious data handling, no obfuscation. It is a standard SDK stub.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Justification:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code is a set of type annotations, class definitions, and method signatures for the AWS Config boto3 client, with extensive use of overloads for paginators. There are no executable logic, network calls, or data processing within this snippet.\n- **Malware and Obfuscation:** None detected. The code is purely interface and type annotation definitions, likely auto-generated from SDK specifications.\n- **Security Risks:** None apparent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a legitimate, auto-generated SDK stub for AWS Config, intended to provide type safety and IDE support, with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues, no malicious activity, and the scores are appropriate.",
