  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward version declaration.\n- No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- The only notable anomaly is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to the current date (assuming current date is before 2025). This is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n\n**Specific analysis:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**\n   - Confidently states no malicious intent, no anomalies.\n   - Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n   - Security risk: 0 — appropriate.\n   - **Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n2. **Report 2:**\n   - Similar to Report 1, confirms no suspicious activity.\n   - Malware score: 0.\n   - Security risk: 0.\n   - **Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n3. **Report 3:**\n   - Notes the future year (2025) as an anomaly but not malicious.\n   - Confidence slightly lower (0.9) due to the anomaly.\n   - Malware score: 0.\n   - Security risk: 0.\n   - **Score adjustments:** No change needed; the anomaly is benign.\n\n4. **Report 4:**\n   - Reiterates the benign nature.\n   - Malware score: 0.\n   - Security risk: 0.\n   - **Score adjustments:** None.\n\n5. **Report 5:**\n   - Same conclusion, standard version declaration.\n   - Malware score: 0.\n   - Security risk: 0.\n   - **Score adjustments:** None.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All correctly assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the straightforward, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The code is entirely benign. The only minor point is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security issues.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns.",
