  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings to the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a simple Python module that declares a `__version__` variable with a string value `\"1.37.0\"`.\n- It contains only a docstring comment with a copyright notice.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and typical for version declaration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static version string to `__version__` with no malicious or suspicious behavior. No issues are present.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Any mistakes in the reports?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They note the future copyright year (2025) as unusual but not malicious, which is reasonable.  \n  No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code does not perform any actions beyond a static assignment.\n- The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not malicious.\n- The reports' conclusions are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Note:** Given the simplicity, there is no reason to increase the scores. The code is a standard version declaration.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Score | Justification                                                      |\n|-------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0            | No malicious code, no suspicious behavior                          |\n| Obfuscated        | 0            | Code is clear, straightforward, no obfuscation                     |\n| Security Risk     | 0            | No external inputs, no data leaks, no malicious logic             |\n\n---\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate, and the code is benign.**",
