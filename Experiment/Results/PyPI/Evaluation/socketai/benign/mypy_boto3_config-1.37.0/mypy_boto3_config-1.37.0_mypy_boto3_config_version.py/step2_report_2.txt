  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the findings, consistency, and scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code in question is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- All reports agree that there are no data flows from untrusted sources, no dynamic code, no input handling, and no external interactions.\n- The only anomaly noted is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date, but this is not malicious.\n- The code is minimal, standard practice, and appears benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code does contain the `__version__` assignment as described.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Data flow:** No untrusted data sources or sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** The future copyright year.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are present.\n- The only \"issue\" is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not a security concern.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the findings.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports correctly identify that this is a benign, standard version declaration.\n- The mention of the future year is noted but not considered a security issue.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThese scores reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or security issues. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
