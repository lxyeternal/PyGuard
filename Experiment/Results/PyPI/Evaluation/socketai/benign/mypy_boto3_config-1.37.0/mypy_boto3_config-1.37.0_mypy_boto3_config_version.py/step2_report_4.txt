  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the correctness of their assessments, as well as the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward version declaration: a static assignment to `__version__` with an accompanying comment.\n- The code contains no dynamic behavior, input handling, external dependencies, or suspicious patterns.\n- The only notable anomaly is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to the current date, but this is not malicious, just potentially a typo or placeholder.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Evaluations:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple static assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.\n- No data flow from untrusted sources.\n- No anomalies other than the future copyright year, which is benign.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reasoning in all reports is sound and consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- No logical errors or flawed assumptions are evident.\n- The comments about the future year are accurate; it's an anomaly but not malicious.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n- The security risk score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence scores are high (1.0 or 0.9), which seems reasonable given the straightforward nature.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- No issues warrant a higher risk score; the code is benign.\n- The highest confidence is 1.0, and all indicate no security issues.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n- The code does not perform any harmful actions or contain obfuscated malicious code.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is justified.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions:**\n- The only assumption is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all observations are factual.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**- Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n**- Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n**- Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**- Justification:** The code is a simple, static version declaration with no external interactions, no dynamic code, and no malicious patterns. The only anomaly is the future year, which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are appropriate, and there are no overlooked issues. The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Maintain the current scores** (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0).\n- **Note:** If future updates introduce dynamic behavior or external data handling, re-evaluation would be necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or security issues. The reports are consistent and accurate.",
