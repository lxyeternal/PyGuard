  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and evaluate their findings, scores, and any potential issues.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a straightforward static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code, or data flows are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The only anomaly noted is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1.0), which seems appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issue presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static string to `__version__`. There are no malicious behaviors or data flows.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The only minor point is the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, it's not malicious or problematic.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, correct, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Malware:** All 0, correct.\n- **SecurityRisk:** All 0, appropriate.\n\n### Logical reasoning:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- No report claims any vulnerabilities or malicious intent based on assumptions.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable and aligned with the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate given the straightforward static assignment.\n- The anomaly of the future year does not impact security but could be noted as a typo or placeholder.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple, static version declaration with no dynamic or malicious components. The only notable point is the future copyright year, which is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. No changes needed. The overall security risk is negligible, and the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**System conclusion:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a standard, harmless version declaration.",
