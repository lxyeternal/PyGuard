  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a docstring comment and a version variable assignment. The comment states 'Source of truth for version' and includes a copyright with a future year (2025), likely a typo or placeholder. The version string '1.37.0' appears standard. No dynamic code, input handling, or sensitive data is present. No malicious or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version assignment with a copyright notice; no malicious behavior or security issues present.",
