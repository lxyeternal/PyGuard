  "purpose": "Define the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string \"1.37.0\" to the variable __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "None; static assignment without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year 2025 is in the future, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string to __version__, with a comment header. No dynamic code, external inputs, or suspicious patterns are present. The only notable anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or placeholder. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, and have high confidence. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues is found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.",
