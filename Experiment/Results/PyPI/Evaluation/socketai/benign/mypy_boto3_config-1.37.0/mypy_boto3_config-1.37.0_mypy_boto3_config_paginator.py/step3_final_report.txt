{
  "purpose": "The code defines strongly-typed paginator classes for AWS Config service, providing method signatures and documentation links, primarily serving as boilerplate SDK interface wrappers.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, method signatures, and type annotations; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods delegate to boto3's paginator with **kwargs, which are passed directly into SDK calls.",
  "flows": "Source: method signatures with **kwargs; Sink: passing these kwargs into boto3's paginator methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of **kwargs in 'paginate' could, in theory, allow injection if untrusted data is supplied, but this is standard SDK behavior; no code performs validation or sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated, extensive type-annotated boilerplate for boto3 paginators, with no malicious commands, data leaks, or obfuscation. The 'paginate' methods simply delegate to SDK calls, passing user-supplied parameters. No secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The potential security concern is passing untrusted input via **kwargs, which could be misused if upstream validation is absent, but this is a common pattern in SDK wrappers and not an inherent flaw in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-typed SDK interface layer for AWS Config paginators, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minimal risk associated with passing **kwargs is typical in SDK usage and does not indicate malicious activity.",
