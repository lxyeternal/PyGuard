  "purpose": "Define paginator classes for various AWS Config service API operations with type annotations and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Type definitions imported from .type_defs, sys.version_info check, standard typing imports, and the module's own class methods and attributes.",
  "sinks": "Paginator base classes, the 'paginate' methods that generate PageIterator objects, and the documentation links embedded in class docstrings.",
  "flows": "Initialization of paginator classes, calling 'paginate' methods with unpacked kwargs, returning PageIterator objects.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be auto-generated or boilerplate, with extensive type annotation usage and no suspicious data handling. No hardcoded secrets, environment variable misuse, or network calls are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured paginator class definitions for AWS Config service API, with type safety, detailed docstrings linking to official documentation, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. The 'paginate' methods are placeholders with no implementation beyond method signatures and docstrings, consistent with interface definitions. No data leakage, malicious commands, or suspicious behavior is detected. The module relies on external AWS SDK behavior, not executing any untrusted code or system commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, type-annotated paginator class definitions for AWS SDK, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as part of a larger SDK or codebase, primarily providing type safety and documentation. No malicious behavior or security concerns are identified.",
