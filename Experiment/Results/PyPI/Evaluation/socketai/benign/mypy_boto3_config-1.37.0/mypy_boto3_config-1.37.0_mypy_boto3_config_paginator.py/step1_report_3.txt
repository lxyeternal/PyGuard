  "purpose": "Define paginators for AWS Config service client using boto3, with type annotations for improved static typing support.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; class definitions with methods that call 'client.get_paginator' with specific string arguments.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods invoke 'client.get_paginator' and return 'PageIterator' objects, which process data streams from AWS API calls. No untrusted data sources or external inputs are directly used or stored.",
  "flows": "Code instantiates boto3 clients, retrieves paginators via fixed string identifiers, and provides 'paginate' methods that yield data pages. No external or untrusted data flows into the code; the data flow is strictly within AWS SDK calls.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive class and method boilerplate for AWS paginators with strong type annotations; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, or backdoors are present. The presence of a copyright statement in 2025 is unusual but not suspicious. No obfuscation or code injection detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated or boilerplate module implementing AWS Config paginators with detailed type annotations for static analysis. The classes inherit from 'Paginator' and override 'paginate' methods that internally call 'client.get_paginator' with fixed operation names, returning data streams. No dynamic code execution, external data input, or suspicious behavior is observed. The code adheres to standard patterns for boto3 paginator definitions, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, boilerplate, strongly-typed implementation of AWS Config service paginators for boto3, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior detected. It strictly performs data retrieval via AWS SDK without external inputs or harmful side effects.",
