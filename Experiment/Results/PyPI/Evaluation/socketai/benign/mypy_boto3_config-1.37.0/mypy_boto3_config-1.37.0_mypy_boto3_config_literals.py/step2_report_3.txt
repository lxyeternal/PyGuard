  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical content, logical consistency, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a large collection of static string literal type definitions, mainly for AWS resource names, statuses, regions, and other constants.\n- It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code appears to serve as a type hinting module, likely for use in static analysis, IDE support, or type-checked SDKs.\n\n**Security considerations:**\n\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- No dynamic behavior, user input handling, or external data processing.\n- All data are static string literals used solely for type annotations.\n- The import of 'sys' for version checking is routine and not suspicious.\n\n**Malware and obfuscation scores:**\n\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n- The code is straightforward and does not contain any suspicious patterns.\n\n**Potential issues or anomalies:**\n\n- No issues detected. The code is a typical pattern for defining type-safe constants in Python projects, especially for SDKs or type stub files.\n\n**Scores and justification:**\n\n- The reports' scores are consistent with the content.\n- Given the nature of the code, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated score of 0 is also correct.\n- Risk score is 0, as there's no security risk in defining static constants.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- The code is benign, well-structured, and serves a clear purpose for type safety.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is purely static type annotations with no runtime or dynamic components, no external data, and no malicious intent. It is a standard pattern for enhancing type safety in Python codebases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate. The code is a benign, static collection of string literal type definitions for AWS resources, with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is required.",
