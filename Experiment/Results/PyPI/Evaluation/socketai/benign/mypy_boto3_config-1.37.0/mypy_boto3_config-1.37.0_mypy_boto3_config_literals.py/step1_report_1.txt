  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS Config service and related constants to ensure type safety and improve code clarity.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for various string constants, imported 'sys' to determine Python version compatibility for typing import.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code only defines constants and imports modules.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward and consists solely of type annotations and constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' to check Python version and conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It then defines numerous string literal types representing AWS resource names, statuses, and other enums. The 'sys' import and version check are standard for maintaining compatibility and are not malicious. The extensive list of literals appears to be comprehensive type annotations for AWS SDK constants, aiding type safety. No indications of obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious functions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a type-safe definition of constants for AWS services. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident. It is a standard pattern for type annotations in Python projects, especially for AWS SDK stubs.",
