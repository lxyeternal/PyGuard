{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS Config service and related constants to be used for type safety and validation.",
  "sources": "Import statement for sys, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; the code only assigns static literals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors detected; the code strictly defines constants with no dynamic execution or input handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for various AWS-related string literals, importing sys to conditionally import Literal based on Python version. It assigns multiple string literal types to constants for use elsewhere, facilitating type safety. The structure is straightforward, static, and intended solely for type definitions without any data processing, external input, or executable logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a static definition of string literal types for AWS services and configuration options. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It is purely for type safety and documentation support.",
