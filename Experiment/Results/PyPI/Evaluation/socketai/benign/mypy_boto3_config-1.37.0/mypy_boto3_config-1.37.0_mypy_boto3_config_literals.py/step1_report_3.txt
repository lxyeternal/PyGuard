  "purpose": "Define and provide type annotations for various string literals used as constants or enumerations in the config service module.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and typing, and the entire list of string literal definitions assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "None evident; all data is hardcoded string literals used for type annotations and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external or untrusted sources to any sinks; all data is static string literals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code is straightforward, mainly defining string literals for type annotations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, which is standard practice. It then defines numerous variables as string literal types, used for type annotations in AWS config services. The entire code is static, with no runtime data handling, network operations, or input/output outside type definitions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious logic. The purpose appears to be purely to provide accurate type annotations for a larger codebase, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely consists of static type alias definitions using Literal, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a benign module for type hinting purposes within a larger AWS SDK or project. No security risks detected.",
