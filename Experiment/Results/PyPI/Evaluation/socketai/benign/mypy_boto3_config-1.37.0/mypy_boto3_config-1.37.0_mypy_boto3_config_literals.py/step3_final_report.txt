  "purpose": "Static type annotations for AWS resource and status string literals, intended to improve type safety and code clarity in SDKs or type-checked projects.",
  "sources": "Definition of string literals assigned to type aliases, conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; the code is purely static and does not process untrusted data or perform I/O.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; all definitions are static constants used for type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string literal type definitions for AWS resource names, statuses, regions, and other constants. It conditionally imports 'Literal' for compatibility, which is a common pattern. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or runtime logic. The code serves as a type hinting module to enhance static analysis and IDE support. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type annotations for AWS SDK constants. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concern. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
