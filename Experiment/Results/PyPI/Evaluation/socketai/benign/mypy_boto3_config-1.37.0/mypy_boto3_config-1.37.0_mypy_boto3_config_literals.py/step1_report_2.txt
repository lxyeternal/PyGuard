  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for various AWS Config service-related constants and identifiers, facilitating type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Reading static string literals for different AWS resource types, actions, regions, and other enumerations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code only defines type annotations without executing untrusted data handling or external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely establishes type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward type annotation definitions with no dynamic or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then assigns numerous string literal types to variables representing AWS resource types, actions, regions, and other enumerations. These are used solely for type hinting and documentation purposes. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data manipulation, network activity, or other malicious behaviors. The structure is typical for type stubs or constant definitions meant to improve type safety in a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type annotation definitions for AWS resource and service identifiers. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious activities. It appears to be a well-formed, standard type definition module without obfuscated or harmful code.",
