{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations for various string literals used as constants in a configuration service, primarily for static type checking in Python projects.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from static variable definitions and imports, specifically the 'sys' module to check Python version compatibility.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; no untrusted data is processed or outputted, and no external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks since the code only declares type constants without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present; the code simply declares Literal types based on static string values. No obfuscation, hard-coded secrets, or suspicious constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then defines a large set of Literal type aliases representing string constants. These constants cover various AWS services, resource types, regions, paginator names, and other enumerations. The purpose is to facilitate type checking and code clarity. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data handling, or code execution mechanisms that could be malicious. The overall structure is straightforward and static.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, providing type annotations for static analysis without executing any runtime logic or handling untrusted data. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or malicious intent.",
