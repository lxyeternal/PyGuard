  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward set of type annotations for AWS constants, with no malicious behavior. The code imports 'sys' to handle Python version compatibility and defines numerous Literal types. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate and reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard type stub code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it notes the code's purpose as defining type annotations for AWS resource types and statuses. No dynamic behavior or malicious patterns are detected. The code is static, with no external data or network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, well-formed type definitions.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** The review correctly states that the code is purely static, defining string literals for type hints, with no runtime or external data handling. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard type annotation module.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior analyses, it emphasizes the static nature, the use of conditional imports for compatibility, and the absence of dynamic or malicious code. The purpose is solely to facilitate type safety.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Harmless, purely declarative.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms the code's static, type annotation role, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. The purpose is to define constants for AWS services and configurations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Completely benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- All reports agree that the code is static, contains only type annotations, and no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- The conditional import of 'Literal' is a common pattern for compatibility and not suspicious.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, backdoors, data leaks, or runtime code execution.\n- The purpose is to improve type safety and code clarity, typical for SDK stub files.\n\n### Final Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:\nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the reports' assessments.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk, as the code is static and benign.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS SDK constants, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
