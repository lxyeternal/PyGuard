  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report to determine if the claims are justified and to identify any inconsistencies or overlooked risks.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe a straightforward Python module defining numerous string literal types for AWS resource names, statuses, and other constants.\n- The code includes a standard version check for importing 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'.\n- No dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose appears to be static type annotations to improve type safety and code clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code presence:** The code only contains static type alias definitions and imports; no executable or dynamic code is present.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected. The code is purely declarative.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **No flaws or mistakes:** The reports correctly identify that the code is static, straightforward, and benign.\n- **Potential over-scoring of malware or risk:** All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, static code.\n- **Risk Score:** All assign 0 or very low, which is justified as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Potential for Assumptions:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly notes the static nature and purpose of the code.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\nThe code is a standard, static type annotation module for AWS SDK constants, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately assess the code as benign. No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary. The code is a typical, safe type stub module.",
