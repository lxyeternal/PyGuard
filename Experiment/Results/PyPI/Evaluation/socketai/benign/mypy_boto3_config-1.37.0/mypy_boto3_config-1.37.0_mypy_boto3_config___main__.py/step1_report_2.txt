  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No suspicious data leaks or external communications.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI entrypoint that outputs package information or version details. It reads command-line arguments using sys.argv and writes to standard output. There are no external network calls, no data collection, no code injection, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior. The only functions perform benign output tasks based on user input.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility for displaying package information and version number. There are no indicators of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks.",
