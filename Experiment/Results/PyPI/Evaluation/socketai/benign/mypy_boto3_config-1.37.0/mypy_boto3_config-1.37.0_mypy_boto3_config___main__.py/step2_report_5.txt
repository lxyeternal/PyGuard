  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review**:\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It uses only standard library modules (`sys`) and performs no network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The functions are simple, benign, and serve purely informational purposes.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity**:\n   - All five reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - They consistently note the absence of suspicious code, external communication, or security-sensitive operations.\n   - The analysis in each report is thorough and aligns with the code content.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Concerns**:\n   - There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n5. **Final Justification**:\n   - Since the code is a minimal CLI script with no malicious or suspicious behavior, scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n   - The risk score of 0 is justified, given the absence of any security concerns.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic or external operations.\n   - No hidden or malicious intent is detectable.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Summary of my assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe provided reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, and no adjustments to the scores are necessary. All indicators point to a safe, straightforward CLI utility with no security risks.",
