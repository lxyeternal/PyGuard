  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code and the provided reports.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a straightforward CLI utility.\n- It imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version.\n- Checks for \"--version\" argument; if present, prints version; otherwise, prints info.\n- No external network calls, no data leaks, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution.\n- All output is hardcoded strings.\n- No suspicious or malicious code detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n- **Malware presence:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risks:** None.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5**:\n- All consistently describe the script as a benign CLI utility.\n- No suspicious behavior, external network activity, or obfuscation.\n- All assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n- The analysis in each report aligns well with the code's straightforward functionality.\n\n**Scores:**\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- The reasoning is sound, with no contradictions or assumptions about vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n\n### Potential improvements:\n- No changes needed; all assessments are accurate and consistent.\n- Since the code is very simple, the risk scores are appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a benign CLI script that outputs package info or version based on command-line arguments. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.\n\n**My final recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is safe, straightforward, and free of security issues.",
