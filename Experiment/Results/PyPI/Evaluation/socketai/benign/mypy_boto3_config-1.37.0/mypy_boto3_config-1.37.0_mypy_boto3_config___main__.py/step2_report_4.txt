  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review and Functionality Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It reads `sys.argv` to determine if `--version` is present, then calls the respective print functions.\n   - It writes output to `sys.stdout`.\n   - No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, and no handling of sensitive data.\n   - The code is static, simple, and standard for such CLI scripts.\n\n2. **Evaluation of Report Validity:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - They consistently state that there are no hardcoded secrets, no external communications, and no signs of malware or security risks.\n   - The analysis in each report is thorough and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate given the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code does not perform any risky operations.\n   - The purpose and analysis are consistent across reports.\n\n5. **Final Assessment:**\n   - Given the code's simplicity and the reports' consensus, the scores seem appropriate.\n   - The malware score remains at 0, as there's no indication of malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score remains at 0, as the code is not obfuscated.\n   - The overall security risk remains at 0.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign CLI utility.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final note:** All evidence points to this being a standard, harmless CLI script with no security concerns.",
