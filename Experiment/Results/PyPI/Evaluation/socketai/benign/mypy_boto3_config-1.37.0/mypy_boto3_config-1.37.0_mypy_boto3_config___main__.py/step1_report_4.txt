  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint that provides package information and version details for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; outputs data via sys.stdout.write()",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to standard output; no external network or file operations",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument in sys.argv, then calls print_version() or print_info() to output data",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed; straightforward CLI behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and executes based on command-line input. No external network calls, no data leaks, no code injection points, and no obfuscated code. All outputs are hardcoded strings, and there is no dynamic execution or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a simple CLI tool to display package info and version, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
