  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs package info or version based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) to determine output; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to stdout; no untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check leads to calling print_version or print_info functions, which output static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI script that reads command-line arguments and outputs static package info or version. It uses only standard library modules (`sys`) with no network activity, no dynamic code execution, no secrets, and no obfuscation. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior justify these scores. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present, and the code is easy to review and verify.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
