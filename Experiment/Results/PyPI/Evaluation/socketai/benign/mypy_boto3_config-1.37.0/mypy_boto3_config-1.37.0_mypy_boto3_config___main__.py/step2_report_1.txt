  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code review of the provided script:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It uses standard Python libraries (`sys`) with straightforward functions.\n   - No external network calls, no data exfiltration, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, and no secrets.\n   - The output is hardcoded, and the logic is simple and clear.\n\n2. **Assessment of the reports:**\n   - All five reports consistently describe the script as benign, straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that the script only reads command-line arguments and outputs static information.\n   - No anomalies, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and their justification:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities that are based on assumptions; the analysis correctly states that the code is safe.\n   - The scores align well with the code's behavior.\n\n5. **Overall assessment:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent.\n   - No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is entirely benign. The provided reports are accurate and do not overstate any risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward CLI script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and analysis are appropriate. No further action needed.",
