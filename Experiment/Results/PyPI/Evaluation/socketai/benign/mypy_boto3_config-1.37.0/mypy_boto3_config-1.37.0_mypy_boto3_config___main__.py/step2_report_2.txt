  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI script that outputs package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It uses only standard library modules (`sys`) and performs no network activity, file operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The functions are simple, with clear intent, and no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Assessment of Reported Issues:**\n   - All five reports concur that the code is benign, with no anomalies, malicious intent, or security risks.\n   - They uniformly describe the code as a basic CLI utility that reads arguments and outputs hardcoded information.\n   - No discrepancies or contradictions are observed among the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 or 0.0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1 or 1.0), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Scores:**\n   - Since the code does not perform any malicious actions, connect to external systems, or handle sensitive data, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n   - Obfuscation is not present; the code is clear and readable.\n   - Security risk is minimal to none, given the benign operations.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No issues detected that would warrant raising the malware or risk scores.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n6. **Final Recommendations:**\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n   - No further action or escalation is necessary.\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a benign CLI utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
