  "flows": "Input from sys.argv (user command) to stdout outputs via sys.stdout.write.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious instructions.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, providing CLI options to display package info and version. It uses standard libraries (sys) for input and output, with no external or suspicious calls. No data is fetched from or sent over the network, no environment variables or sensitive data are used or exposed. The structure is simple, with no obfuscated code or dynamic execution. Overall, the code performs standard CLI tasks without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility that outputs package information and version. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this code.",
