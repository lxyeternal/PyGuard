  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-config' to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports 'setup' from setuptools; uses hardcoded package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution or external data outputs detected.",
  "flows": "Reads local file for description -> passes static package configuration to setup() -> no flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration for packaging a Python library. It reads static data from a local file, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. The code strictly follows conventional patterns without dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. There are no indicators of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, command execution, or credential theft.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical, benign setup script used for Python package distribution. It does not contain malware, security risks, or malicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and secure.",
