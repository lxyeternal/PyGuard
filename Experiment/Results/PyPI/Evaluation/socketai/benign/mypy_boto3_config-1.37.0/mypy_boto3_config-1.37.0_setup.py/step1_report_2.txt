  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-config package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; reads package metadata and dependencies; imports setup from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data processing are present.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and defines package setup parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns. The license and author info are standard; no suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads a markdown file for long description, and calls setuptools.setup with static package metadata. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution observed. No code injection or malicious data handling detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
