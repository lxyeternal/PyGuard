  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard Python setup script, reading a local README.md file, importing 'setup' from setuptools, and defining package metadata, dependencies, and URLs.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, untrusted input handling, network activity, or obfuscated code.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the script, with no anomalies, no suspicious behaviors, and no malware indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and code analysis:\n\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  The code matches the description; no issues or malicious code are present. It’s a typical setup.py script.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**  \n  No logical errors or flaws are evident. The code is straightforward and correctly structured.\n\n- **Malware or obfuscation:**  \n  No malware or obfuscation detected. The code is clear, static, and conventional.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:**  \n  No vulnerabilities are present. The script does not process untrusted input or perform any risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring evaluation:\n\n| Report # | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Justification |\n|------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1          | 0               | 0                  | 0            | No malicious behavior, static code, no obfuscation. |\n| 2          | 0               | 0                  | 0            | Same reasoning; standard setup script. |\n| 3          | 0               | 0                  | 0            | No anomalies or suspicious activity. |\n| 4          | 0               | 0                  | 0            | No malicious or obfuscated code. |\n| 5          | 0               | 0                  | 0            | Clear, benign setup script. |\n\nAll reports assign zero scores across malware, obfuscation, and risk, which is consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Note:** The reports' confidence levels are all 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a standard, benign Python setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors. All reports are consistent, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign and standard nature of the script, with no security concerns.",
