  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static imports, reading a local file, and defining package info. No dynamic or untrusted input handling, network activity, or obfuscation detected. All indicators point to benign, standard packaging code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup file with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent.",
