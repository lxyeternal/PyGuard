{
  "purpose": "Define detailed type annotations for various AWS Config service data structures to ensure type safety and clarity in SDK usage.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, and local modules; constants and class definitions within the file.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no code executes untrusted input or writes untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily type definitions and static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns such as dynamic code execution, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets. The code strictly defines type annotations and data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of TypedDict and Union definitions for AWS Config service, including conditional imports based on Python version. There are no functions executing runtime logic, no network calls, and no credential handling or data leaks. The primary purpose is static type annotation, which is inherently safe. The imports from sys, datetime, and typing are standard, and the code only defines data schemas without any executable logic. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are evident. The structure and content are consistent with a well-structured type definitions module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a purely declarative module providing type annotations for AWS Config SDK data structures. It contains no executable or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
