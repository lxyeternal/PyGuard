{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS Config service data structures and request/response types to facilitate static type checking and improve code readability.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys module for version checks, standard libraries datetime, sys, typing, and local literals module; type definitions and constants; class definitions for TypedDict with fields, type unions, and aliases.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code primarily defines data types and schemas without executing untrusted code or handling external inputs directly.",
  "flows": "Type annotations and class definitions are static and do not process data at runtime; no data flow from source to sink, no execution of untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; extensive use of type annotations and structured data schemas; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or insecure patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, establishing type definitions with TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It imports necessary modules, defines data schemas for various AWS Config entities, request, and response types, and includes no executable logic, data handling, or runtime code. The absence of dynamic evaluation, network activity, or external data processing indicates no malicious behavior. The focus on type annotations supports static analysis, and all patterns align with standard practice for Python SDKs and type hinting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static type definitions intended for schema validation and type safety within an AWS Config SDK. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. No indicators of malware, obfuscated code, or supply chain attacks are present.",
