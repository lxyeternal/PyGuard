  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for AWS Config service SDK in Python using TypedDict and Union for better type safety and clarity.",
  "sources": "Module imports, type annotations, and TypedDict class definitions for AWS Config SDK components.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code is primarily type definitions with no runtime data handling or external calls.",
  "flows": "Type annotations and class definitions do not include any runtime data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, such as obfuscated code, code injection, or hidden behavior. Usage of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely composed of type annotations, TypedDict class definitions, and Union types to structure data for AWS Config SDK. There are no executable statements, no dynamic code, no network or file operations, and no user input handling. All classes are declarative, meant for static type checking. There are no signs of malicious code such as hidden backdoors, code injection, data exfiltration, or other suspicious behaviors. The conditional imports based on Python version are standard for compatibility and do not introduce malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for type definitions to improve code safety and readability within the AWS Config SDK context. No malicious behavior or sabotage is present.",
