  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS Config service data structures and request/response types for type safety and clarity.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type alias definitions, and class definitions using TypedDict and Union.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that process untrusted data; mainly type definitions, no data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Type definitions flow from source code annotations to usage in API request/response handling; no runtime data flow or untrusted data handling evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Use of standard typing constructs and type unions. No dynamic code execution, eval, or code injection observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of type definitions using Python's typing system, including TypedDict, Union, and NotRequired annotations. No executable logic, external data handling, or network interactions are present. The code is structured to enhance type safety for AWS Config SDK interactions, with conditional imports based on Python version. All definitions are straightforward data schemas with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. No code injection, data leakage, or sabotage mechanisms are identifiable.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely declarative type annotations intended for API data structures. It does not contain executable logic, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors. No malware or security risks are detected within this code fragment.",
