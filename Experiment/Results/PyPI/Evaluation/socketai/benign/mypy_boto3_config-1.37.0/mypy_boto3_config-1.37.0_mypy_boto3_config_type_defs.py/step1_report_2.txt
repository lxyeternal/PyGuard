  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for AWS Config service SDK in Python using TypedDict, unions, and conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Static type definitions, import statements, and type annotations; no runtime input or external data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data, no data leaks or malicious output functions observed.",
  "flows": "Type definitions and annotations are static; no data flow or processing logic present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely declarative, defining data schemas; no suspicious logic, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No evidence of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of type annotations and data structure definitions for a Python AWS SDK module. It uses conditional imports to handle different Python versions, and defines numerous TypedDict classes, Unions, and constants. There are no functions executing runtime logic, external input handling, or network communication. All elements follow standard patterns for type hinting and schema definition. No anomalies, malicious behavior, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a purely declarative, type annotation module for AWS Config SDK in Python. It contains no runtime, executable, or malicious code segments. It is consistent with standard type definitions and has no indications of supply chain security threats.",
