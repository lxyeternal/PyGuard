  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n   - No executable logic, data handling, or runtime code is present.\n   - No dynamic code execution, eval, or obfuscation is evident.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Reasoning**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely declarative, with no runtime or malicious behavior.\n   - They highlight the extensive use of type annotations and structured schemas, which is standard for SDKs.\n   - No inaccuracies or logical flaws are apparent in the assessments.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated code, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n   - The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malicious Indicators**:\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - The use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard practice for compatibility.\n   - The code is static and declarative, serving as type annotations for an SDK.\n\n5. **Assumptions and Claims**:\n   - The reports correctly assume that the code is purely for static type definitions.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about malicious behavior are made.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and purpose.\n   - No anomalies or inconsistencies are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — No obfuscation; code is straightforward type annotations.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks or vulnerabilities present.\n\n### Expert Justification:\nThe code is a static, declarative module defining data schemas for AWS Config SDK in Python. It uses standard typing constructs, conditional imports for compatibility, and does not process external data or execute any logic at runtime. The absence of dynamic code, external data handling, or executable statements indicates zero security threat or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**The code is safe, clean, and solely intended for static type checking. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.**",
