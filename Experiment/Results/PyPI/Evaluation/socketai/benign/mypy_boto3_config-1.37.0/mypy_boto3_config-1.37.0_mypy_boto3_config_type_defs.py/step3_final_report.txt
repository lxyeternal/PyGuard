{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Config SDK in Python, facilitating type checking and schema validation.",
  "sources": "Defines TypedDict classes, constants, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility; no runtime data handling or external input processing.",
  "sinks": "None; purely declarative type definitions with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Static type annotations; no data flow or executable logic present.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward type schema definitions without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of extensive static type definitions using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for compatibility. It contains no executable statements, external data handling, or dynamic code. The structure aligns with standard SDK schema definitions, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured set of static type definitions for AWS Config in Python. It shows no indicators of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
