{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for visualization conversions, involving loading specifications, rendering images, and comparing outputs, with no network activity or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "File reads for specs, locales, expected outputs; in-memory image processing; temporary files for PDF rendering.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission or system modification; data flows from local files to in-memory processing.",
  "flows": "Source files are read and processed locally; no untrusted external data influences critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs local file I/O, image comparisons, and PDF rendering via pdfium in a standard, controlled manner. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present. External dependencies like pdfium are used in a typical way, with proper resource management. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential minimal external dependency concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured testing suite with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score (0.1) appropriately reflects the external dependency but does not indicate any threat.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
