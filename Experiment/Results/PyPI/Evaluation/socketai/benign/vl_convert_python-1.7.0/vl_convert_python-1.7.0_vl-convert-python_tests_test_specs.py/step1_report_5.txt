{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for verifying the conversion of Vega-Lite specifications into various formats like Vega, SVG, PNG, JPEG, and PDF, including localization and theme options.",
  "sources": "Reads from JSON spec files, expected output files, locale JSON files, and external image resources (via URL references within specs).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted input files or URLs are used, but within this code, no network calls or untrusted data writes are evident. The code processes image data and generates output images and PDFs.",
  "flows": "Input files are read as sources; their data is parsed and converted into images or specifications; outputs are generated and compared against expected data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated code; no network activity or external system modifications observed. Usage of external libraries is standard for image and PDF processing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file-based operations for loading specifications, locales, and expected outputs. It uses well-known libraries for image processing and PDF rendering, with no evidence of malicious code. The temporary file handling is safe, and no dynamic code execution or network communication occurs. The functions mainly read from static files and generate images, with tests designed to compare outputs. No hidden or backdoor-like behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate test suite for visualizations and contains no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. It operates on local files and external dependencies in a safe manner.",
