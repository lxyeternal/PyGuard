  "purpose": "Re-export functions from the 'pyudorandom' module for use in other parts of the project.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from .pyudorandom import shuffle, items, bin_gcd, indices'. Metadata definitions (__title__, __version__, __author__, __license__, __all__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points are evident in this code segment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only imports and declares metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of metadata declarations and an import statement. The import is relative, indicating it is part of a larger package. No malicious functions, network operations, or data leaks are present. The functions imported are from a local module and are not inherently malicious. The file does not perform any computations or I/O operations that could be exploited or contain malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving only as a module initializer or metadata container with a standard import. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
