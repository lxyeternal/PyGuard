{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that re-exports functions from a submodule named 'pyudorandom'. It mainly defines package metadata and exposes specific functions.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions ('shuffle', 'items', 'bin_gcd', 'indices') from a local module '.pyudorandom'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no network, file, or environment interaction present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is primarily metadata and import statements without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, hidden logic, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module, sets package metadata such as title, version, author, and license, and exposes these functions via __all__. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. It does not perform any input/output operations or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package __init__ file, serving as a re-export of functions and setting metadata. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
