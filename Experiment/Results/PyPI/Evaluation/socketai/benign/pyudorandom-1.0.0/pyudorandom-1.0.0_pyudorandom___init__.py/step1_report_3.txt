{
  "purpose": "Defines module metadata and exports functions imported from a local module 'pyudorandom'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyudorandom, and module metadata variables",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; primarily metadata and import statements",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import (.pyudorandom) is unusual but not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code only contains metadata assignments and a relative import of functions from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious external interactions. The import is from a local file, which does not suggest supply chain compromise. The metadata indicates author and version info, typical for a library module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
