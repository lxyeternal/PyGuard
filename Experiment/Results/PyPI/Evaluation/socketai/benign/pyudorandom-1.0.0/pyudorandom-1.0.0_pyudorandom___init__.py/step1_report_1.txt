  "purpose": "Export functions shuffle, items, bin_gcd, and indices from the local module pyudorandom for use in other code.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module .pyudorandom",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external output; no network or file operations present",
  "flows": "No data flows observable within this snippet, as it only involves import and export declarations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines package metadata and exports functions imported from a local module. There are no input or data reading operations, no processing, and no external communication. The import is relative, indicating internal module usage. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The functions imported could be related to randomness, but this code does not include their implementation or usage, making it impossible to assess their security or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward module export with no indications of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be part of a package defining metadata and re-exporting functions from an internal module. There are no suspicious behaviors or anomalies identified.",
