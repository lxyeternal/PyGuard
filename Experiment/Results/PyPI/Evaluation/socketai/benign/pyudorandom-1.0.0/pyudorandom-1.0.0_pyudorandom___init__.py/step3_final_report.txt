  "purpose": "Module initialization and re-export of functions from a local module, with package metadata.",
  "sources": "Relative import from .pyudorandom, package metadata variables",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "Import from local module to module namespace; no external data flow",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and metadata assignment",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that sets package metadata and re-exports functions from a local module. No data processing, input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The import is relative, typical for internal package structure, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are detected. The functions imported are likely utility functions related to randomness and mathematics, but their implementation is not provided. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
