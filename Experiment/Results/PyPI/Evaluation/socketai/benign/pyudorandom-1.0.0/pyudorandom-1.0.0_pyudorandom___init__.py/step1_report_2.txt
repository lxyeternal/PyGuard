  "purpose": "To re-export specific functions from the pyudorandom module, likely for use in other parts of a larger package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyudorandom, and metadata variables (__title__, __version__, __author__, __license__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data output, network communication, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative and import/export based.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward module metadata and re-export statements with no dynamic code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module metadata and re-exports functions from a local module. It does not perform any data processing, input handling, or external communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hardcoded secrets, network activity, or code injection. The import path is relative, indicating it's part of a larger package, but that alone is not suspicious. No obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module header with re-exports, containing no malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and intended for code organization.",
