{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pyudorandom' Python package, used for distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Imports 'setuptools', 'distutils.core', and 'pyudorandom' module to retrieve version and author information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "The script reads metadata such as version and author from 'pyudorandom' module during setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors; standard setup script. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'setuptools' for setup utilities, falling back to 'distutils.core' if not available, which is standard practice. It then imports the 'pyudorandom' module to access version and author metadata dynamically. The setup function defines package metadata, including name, version, author, and description, and specifies classifiers and test suite. All operations are typical for a Python package setup script. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a conventional distribution script.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup script for the 'pyudorandom' package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
