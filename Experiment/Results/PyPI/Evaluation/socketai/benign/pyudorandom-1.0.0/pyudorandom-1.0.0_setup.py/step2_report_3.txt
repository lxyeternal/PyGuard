  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a standard Python setup script that imports 'setuptools' or 'distutils', then imports the 'pyudorandom' module to retrieve its `__version__` and `__author__` attributes, which are used in the `setup()` call.\n- The code appears straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the script is standard, with no security risks or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description in all reports.\n- The attributes `pyudorandom.__version__` and `pyudorandom.__author__` are accessed, which is common in setup scripts.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The only concern raised in some reports is that using attributes from the module (`pyudorandom.__version__`, `pyudorandom.__author__`) could be problematic if those attributes are compromised or maliciously altered. However, this is a standard practice in many setup scripts, assuming the module is trustworthy.\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malware is present in the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Security risk:** 0 (no apparent risks)\n\nGiven the above, I agree with the reports' assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The code is a standard setup script with no security issues.\n- The use of module attributes for version and author is common, but it assumes the module is trustworthy.\n- No changes needed in the scoring or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security concerns)\n\n**Summary:** This setup script is benign, standard, and safe. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
