{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging and distribution of the 'pyudorandom' Python module, providing metadata and package information for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's __version__ and __author__ attributes to populate setup metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is used directly in the code; it only reads package metadata and configuration information.",
  "flows": "The code imports version and author information from the 'pyudorandom' module, then passes this data into the setup() function to prepare the package.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution or suspicious behavior. Usage of version and author attributes from the package is standard. No malicious or unusual code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import 'setuptools' for enhanced packaging support; if unavailable, it falls back to 'distutils'. It then imports 'pyudorandom' to access its __version__ and __author__ attributes, which are used in the setup() call. The setup() function specifies package metadata, including name, version, author info, classifiers, description, and test suite. The code follows standard packaging practices without including any suspicious code, external network activity, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a legitimate and standard configuration for packaging the 'pyudorandom' module. It does not contain malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or malicious code. The use of attributes from the package itself is normal practice. Overall, there are no security concerns based on this code.",
