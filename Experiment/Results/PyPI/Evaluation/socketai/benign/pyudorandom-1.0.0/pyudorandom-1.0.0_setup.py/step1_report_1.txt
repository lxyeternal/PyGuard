{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'pyudorandom' Python package including metadata and test suite.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools/distutils, import of 'pyudorandom' module, and access to 'pyudorandom.__version__' and 'pyudorandom.__author__'.",
  "sinks": "Use of 'pyudorandom.__version__' and 'pyudorandom.__author__' for package metadata, which could potentially be manipulated if those attributes are compromised.",
  "flows": "Importing 'pyudorandom' and accessing its attributes flows into the setup function to embed version and author info into package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected. The code performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import setup from setuptools, falling back to distutils if necessary. It then imports the 'pyudorandom' module to retrieve its __version__ and __author__ attributes for use in package metadata. This is typical for Python package setup scripts. No unusual patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious actions are present. All imported modules and used attributes appear standard and intended for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The use of module attributes for version and author information is normal, assuming the module itself is trustworthy.",
