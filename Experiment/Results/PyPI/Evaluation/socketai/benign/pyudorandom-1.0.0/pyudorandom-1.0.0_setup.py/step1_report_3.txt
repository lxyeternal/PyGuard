{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up the packaging information for the 'pyudorandom' Python library, including metadata and test suite configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'setuptools'/'distutils' and 'pyudorandom' module attributes like '__version__' and '__author__'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data affects system security; no data leaks, network calls, or unsafe executions detected.",
  "flows": "The source (imported 'pyudorandom' attributes) flows into the setup configuration for package metadata; no external data flows or user inputs are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual code patterns. The use of 'pyudorandom' attributes appears standard. No obfuscation or malicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions and the 'pyudorandom' module, then calls 'setup()' with package metadata. The metadata includes version and author info derived from 'pyudorandom'. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection, are present. The only external input is the 'pyudorandom' module's attributes, which are expected to be safe. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply packages the 'pyudorandom' library for distribution.",
