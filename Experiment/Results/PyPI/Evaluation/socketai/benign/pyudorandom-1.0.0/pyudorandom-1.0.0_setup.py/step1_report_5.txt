  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pyudorandom' Python package, used for distributing and installing the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements (from setuptools or distutils), access to 'pyudorandom.__version__', 'pyudorandom.__author__'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Imports lead to package metadata extraction; no data flows involving user input or external data.",
  "anomalies": "Standard setup script with no suspicious or unusual code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup by importing necessary modules and referencing package attributes for version and author. It uses standard practices for fallback imports and package metadata definition. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are apparent. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a conventional setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious behavior or security concerns. It does not contain any anomalies or indicators of malware.",
