  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Python setup script.\n- They highlight that the script imports 'setuptools' or 'distutils', then imports 'pyudorandom' to access its `__version__` and `__author__` attributes.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are all zero or very close to zero, with high confidence levels.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code appears straightforward and typical for Python package setup.\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Accessing module attributes for version and author info is standard practice, assuming the module is trustworthy.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The only potential concern could be if the 'pyudorandom' module itself is malicious or compromised, but this is outside the scope of this script.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or very close to 0, which seems appropriate.\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all reports give scores of 0 for malware and security risk, and the code is standard, there's no justification for higher scores.\n- The only hypothetical concern would be if the 'pyudorandom' module is malicious, but this is outside the code's logic itself.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Given the code, there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n- The module's attributes are used for metadata, which is standard.\n- Therefore, malware score should remain at 0.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- No assumptions are made about the content of 'pyudorandom' module beyond its attributes.\n- No external data or network activity is involved.\n- No suspicious patterns or code obfuscation are present.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated code score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The only concern could be the trustworthiness of the 'pyudorandom' module itself, but that is outside the scope of this code review.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, I agree with the current scores. The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
