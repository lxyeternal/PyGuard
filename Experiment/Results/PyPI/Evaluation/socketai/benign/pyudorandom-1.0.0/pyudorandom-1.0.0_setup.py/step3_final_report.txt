  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that imports 'setuptools' or 'distutils', then accesses 'pyudorandom' module attributes for metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'setuptools'/'distutils', import of 'pyudorandom' module to access '__version__' and '__author__'.",
  "sinks": "Accessing module attributes; no sinks for untrusted data or external effects.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pyudorandom' followed by usage of its attributes in setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward code. Dependence on 'pyudorandom' attributes assumes module trustworthiness.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for Python packages, attempting to import 'setuptools' with fallback, then importing 'pyudorandom' to retrieve version and author info for package metadata. No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The use of module attributes is standard, assuming the module is trustworthy. No external network activity, code injection, or data leaks are evident. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. The main concern is the trustworthiness of 'pyudorandom', but this is outside the scope of this script. Overall, the code is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No modifications are necessary.",
