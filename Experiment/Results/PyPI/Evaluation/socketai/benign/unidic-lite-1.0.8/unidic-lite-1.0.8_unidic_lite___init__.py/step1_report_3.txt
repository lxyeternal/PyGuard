  "purpose": "Importing constants DICDIR and VERSION from a local module unidic",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module .unidic to import DICDIR and VERSION",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or external output",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external input; just static imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code simply performs a relative import of two variables from a local module. No data input, no external communication, and no dynamic code execution are present. The import appears standard and harmless. The module names suggest localization or dictionary-related functionality, which is typical for language processing packages.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
