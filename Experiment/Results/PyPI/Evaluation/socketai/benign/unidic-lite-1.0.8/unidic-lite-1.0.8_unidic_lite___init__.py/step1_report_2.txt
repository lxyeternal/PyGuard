  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports are performed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, just an import statement; no suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two identifiers from a relative module, which is a common practice in Python for modular design. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activity. Given the limited content, the code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any actions that could compromise security.",
