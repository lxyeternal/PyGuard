  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data flows present",
  "flows": "Import from .unidic to the current namespace; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple import statement with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of constants from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data flow. The import is standard practice in Python projects. No external inputs, dynamic code execution, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code's simplicity and context suggest it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. The initial assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
