  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Assessment**: The code is a simple import statement from a local module `.unidic`. No untrusted data, external effects, or obfuscation are present.\n   - **Score justification**: The malware score is 0, which aligns with the benign nature. Security risk is 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n   - **Conclusion**: The report is accurate. No issues here.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Assessment**: Similar to report 1, a straightforward import with no suspicious behavior.\n   - **Score justification**: Malware score 0 is appropriate. Confidence is high (0.9), given the simplicity.\n   - **Conclusion**: Correct assessment.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Assessment**: Again, a minimal import statement. No external data, no obfuscation.\n   - **Score justification**: Malware remains 0; the import is benign.\n   - **Conclusion**: Valid.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Assessment**: Same as above—simple import, no anomalies.\n   - **Score justification**: Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: Correct.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Assessment**: Identical to previous reports—benign import statement.\n   - **Score justification**: Malware score 0, security risk 0.\n   - **Conclusion**: Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data flow.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n### Final overall assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe code snippet is a standard, harmless import statement. No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: Since the code is just an import statement, there's no indication of malicious intent or obfuscation. The high confidence and zero scores are justified.",
