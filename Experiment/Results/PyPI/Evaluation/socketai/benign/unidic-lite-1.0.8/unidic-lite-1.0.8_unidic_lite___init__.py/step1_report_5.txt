{
  "purpose": "Importing constants DICDIR and VERSION from a local module named unidic.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which accesses the local module unidic.",
  "sinks": "None directly; the code does not execute untrusted data or perform output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; this is only a static import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of context; the import statement alone does not reveal malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports two identifiers from a local module, indicating use of relative imports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The presence of DICDIR and VERSION suggests configuration or versioning constants, typical in packages.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this single import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears benign, serving as part of a module that utilizes these constants.",
