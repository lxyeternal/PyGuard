{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up a Python package named 'unidic-lite' with metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file from the package directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; the script only prepares package metadata for installation.",
  "flows": "Reads file content to include in package description; no data flows leading to execution or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'distutils.core' alongside 'setuptools' which is unnecessary and potentially confusing but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and reads a README file to include as long description. It defines package metadata such as name, version, author, description, URL, classifiers, and package data. No external data, network communication, or code execution occurs. The code structure aligns with standard Python packaging practices. The use of both 'setuptools' and 'distutils' is redundant but not malicious. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The inclusion of both 'setuptools' and 'distutils' is suboptimal but not malicious.",
