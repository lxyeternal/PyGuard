  "purpose": "To set up and configure the Python package 'unidic-lite' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file from the local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> No further data flow that affects runtime behavior or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs present. Uses standard setup tools and straightforward package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup modules, reads a local README file for the long description, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata and data. No user input, network activity, or obfuscated code is involved. All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It reads a local file for documentation purposes and proceeds with package configuration. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
