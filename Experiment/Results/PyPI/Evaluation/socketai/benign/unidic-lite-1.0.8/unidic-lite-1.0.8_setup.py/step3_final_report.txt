{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python package setup script used to configure and distribute the 'unidic-lite' library.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; uses package metadata for setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> passes metadata to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'distutils.core' alongside 'setuptools' (not malicious, but outdated). No obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward package setup with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (~0). The only minor concern is the outdated use of 'distutils', which does not pose a security threat. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The code's purpose is solely to package the library, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
