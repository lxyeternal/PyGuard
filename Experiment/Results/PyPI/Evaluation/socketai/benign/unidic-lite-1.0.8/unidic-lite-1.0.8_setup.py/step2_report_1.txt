  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward setup script for the 'unidic-lite' package. The code reads a local README.md file and invokes `setuptools.setup()` with package metadata. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or external data handling.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior and Anomalies**  \n   All reports consistently note the absence of suspicious or malicious code. The use of `distutils.core` alongside `setuptools` is outdated but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or external inputs are present.\n\n3. **Security Risks and Data Flows**  \n   The scripts do not process untrusted input, perform network communication, or handle sensitive data insecurely. The only file operation is reading a local README.md, which is standard practice.\n\n4. **Scores and Reasoning**  \n   - **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Risk score:** Mostly 0.9 to 1, reflecting high confidence that the script is benign. Report 4 assigns a slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a minimal security risk (0.1), which seems reasonable given the use of deprecated modules but no malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Improvements**  \n   - The use of `distutils.core` is deprecated; it would be better to rely solely on `setuptools`. However, this is a maintenance concern, not a security risk.\n   - No signs of supply chain compromise or malicious payloads.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the total absence of suspicious activity, I would assign a risk score of **0**. The minor concerns about outdated modules do not constitute a security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Set overall risk score to 0, reflecting the benign nature of this script.",
