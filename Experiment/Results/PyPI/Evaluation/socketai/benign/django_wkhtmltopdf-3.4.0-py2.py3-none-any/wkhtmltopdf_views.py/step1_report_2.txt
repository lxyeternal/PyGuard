  "purpose": "Defines Django HTTP and TemplateResponse classes for generating PDFs from templates, with options for filename, inline or attachment disposition, and wkhtmltopdf command options.",
  "sources": "Reads request parameters (e.g., request.GET), function arguments (e.g., filename, cmd_options), and template rendering functions.",
  "sinks": "Sets HTTP headers (Content-Disposition), calls rendering functions, and executes wkhtmltopdf command options.",
  "flows": "User input (request.GET, function args) influences filename, content disposition, and wkhtmltopdf options, which then determine PDF rendering and HTTP response headers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of wkhtmltopdf command options appears standard and controlled via class attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs HTTP responses for PDFs, allowing filenames and display options to be set via parameters. It uses external rendering functions (render_pdf_from_template) that could invoke wkhtmltopdf, with command options supplied from class attributes. The response headers are set based on filenames, with no direct user input used to modify headers insecurely. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic identified. The code relies on external rendering and wkhtmltopdf, which, if misused, could pose security concerns, but no evidence of malicious behavior in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for PDF rendering in Django, with no malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It correctly manages user input and response headers without evident security flaws or malicious actions.",
