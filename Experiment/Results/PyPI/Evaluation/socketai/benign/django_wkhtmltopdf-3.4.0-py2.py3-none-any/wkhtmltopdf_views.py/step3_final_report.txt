  "purpose": "Provides classes and views for rendering PDFs from Django templates, handling filenames, headers, and wkhtmltopdf options.",
  "sources": "Request GET parameters (e.g., 'as'), class attributes (filename, cmd_options), template rendering functions, external functions (`render_pdf_from_template`, `content_disposition_filename`).",
  "sinks": "Response headers (`Content-Disposition`), external PDF rendering functions, wkhtmltopdf command execution.",
  "flows": "User-controlled filename and response type influence headers and rendering; request parameters influence response class and options; external functions process templates and filenames.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation; filename sanitization via `content_disposition_filename` suggests mitigation against header injection.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation for PDF generation in Django, utilizing standard practices. It sanitizes filenames, handles response headers carefully, and switches response classes based on request parameters. External functions are assumed secure; no malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The security risk is minimal, primarily involving user input in filenames and headers, which is managed via sanitization. No network activity or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation for PDF rendering in Django with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant vulnerabilities. The low security risk score is appropriate, assuming external functions are secure and filename sanitization is effective.",
