{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, it is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and potentially external modules. No explicit user input or network data reading is visible.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include logging functions, file writing, and network communication (if present). No clear untrusted data usage is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or function parameters through processing functions, with no clear untrusted data reaching sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are evident. The code uses standard library features and appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Step 1: Reviewed the entire code for input sources such as environment variables, user inputs, or external files. Step 2: Identified sinks like logs, file writes, or network calls, but none are clearly connected to untrusted sources. Step 3: Checked for unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior; none found. Step 4: Noted use of standard modules with no suspicious modifications or hidden code. Overall, the code appears benign and follows typical patterns without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. The code seems to be straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic.",
