  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing or utility functions, with no clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input functions such as reading environment variables, user input, or file reads (if any are present).",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe operations like executing dynamic code, network connections, or file modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through variables and function calls, if any untrusted data is processed in sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials or suspicious domain connections. No obfuscated code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python syntax with typical library functions. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communications, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No unusual code structures or obfuscation techniques observed. The code is clean, with no hidden payloads or malicious intent. Without additional context or external dependencies, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. It seems safe based on the provided snippet, with no suspicious activities detected.",
