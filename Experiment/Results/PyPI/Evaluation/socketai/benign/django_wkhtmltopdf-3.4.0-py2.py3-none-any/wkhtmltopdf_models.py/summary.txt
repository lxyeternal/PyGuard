  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly indicate minimal risk due to lack of code evidence. Suspicious patterns in report 5 should be verified with actual code snippets before assigning higher malware or risk scores. Adjustments recommend lowering report 5's malware score to 0.1 and risk to approximately 0.2-0.3 to reflect unconfirmed suspicion. The overall security posture remains low, contingent on further code analysis."
