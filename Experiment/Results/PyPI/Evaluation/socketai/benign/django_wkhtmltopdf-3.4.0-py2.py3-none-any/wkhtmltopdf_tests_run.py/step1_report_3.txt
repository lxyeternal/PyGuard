  "purpose": "Configure and run Django tests for the 'wkhtmltopdf' application within a Python script.",
  "sources": "Reads the current working directory, environment variables (via os), and imports settings and test runner modules.",
  "sinks": "Executes the test runner which could potentially run code within the 'wkhtmltopdf' app, but there are no direct data sinks like network or file writes originating from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Imports and configures Django settings, then runs tests via DiscoverRunner, with no external data flows to or from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Uses in-memory SQLite database, no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated or suspicious code structures. The code is standard Django setup and test invocation.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Django environment with minimal configuration, including in-memory database and static/media paths, then runs tests for the 'wkhtmltopdf' app. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, file manipulation, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to be a standard test runner script. No malicious payloads or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a straightforward Django test setup and execution for a specific app. No malicious intent or malicious code is identified. It appears to be a benign testing script.",
