  "sinks": "sys.exit(1) upon test failure",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from settings.configure to django.setup; test runner executes tests and reports failures to sys.exit",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no hidden backdoors, standard Django setup and test execution",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a Django environment with in-memory database, configures settings, and runs tests for the wkhtmltopdf package. It uses standard Django APIs, no untrusted input handling or data leaks are present. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a legitimate testing script for a Python package, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django testing setup for the wkhtmltopdf package with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It is safe and does not pose a security threat.",
