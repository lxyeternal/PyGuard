  "sinks": "run_tests() method execution, sys.exit()",
  "flows": "Import statements -> configuration settings -> django.setup() -> test runner -> run_tests() -> sys.exit()",
  "anomalies": "Use of in-memory database with no external input, no use of untrusted input sources, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets or credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes Django settings programmatically, including database, installed apps, middleware, and static/media paths. It sets up Django and executes a test suite for the wkhtmltopdf package. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are involved. The code appears to be a standard test runner setup, with no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or data exfiltration. It does not include any obfuscation, backdoors, or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Django test configuration and execution script with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It appears safe and legitimate for its purpose.",
