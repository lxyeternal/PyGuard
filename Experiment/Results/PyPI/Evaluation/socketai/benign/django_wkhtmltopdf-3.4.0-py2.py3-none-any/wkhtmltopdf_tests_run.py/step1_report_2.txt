  "purpose": "Configure and run Django tests for the 'wkhtmltopdf' application within a controlled environment.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (via os and sys modules), loads Django settings, imports test runner modules, and executes tests.",
  "sinks": "Execution of test suite via DiscoverRunner.run_tests() which may invoke application code during tests.",
  "flows": "Environment setup and configuration -> importing modules -> initializing Django -> running tests -> exit code based on test results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. Uses in-memory database for testing; no network connections or system modifications evident.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Django environment with minimal configuration, loads test modules, and runs tests for the 'wkhtmltopdf' package. The code is straightforward, primarily used for testing purposes. It does not contain dynamic code execution, network activity, or hidden behavior. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious patterns are observed. The code operates within a sandboxed testing context, and all dependencies are standard Django components or project modules. No anomalous data handling or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django testing script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is used for testing the package in an isolated environment and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
