  "purpose": "Configure and execute Django tests for the 'wkhtmltopdf' package using an in-memory database and minimal settings.",
  "sources": "Standard modules ('os', 'sys', 'django'), Django settings configuration, test runner initialization.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit(1) upon test failure.",
  "flows": "Initialization of Django environment -> running tests via DiscoverRunner -> exit code based on test results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Django environment with minimal configuration, using an in-memory database, and runs tests for a specific package. It employs standard Django APIs and patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The use of sys.exit(1) on failure is typical in test scripts. No external inputs, network activity, or secrets are present. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low; minor variations in the reports' scores are due to the use of sys.exit(), which is standard and not inherently risky.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django test runner script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate; minor overestimations of security risk can be corrected to zero. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
