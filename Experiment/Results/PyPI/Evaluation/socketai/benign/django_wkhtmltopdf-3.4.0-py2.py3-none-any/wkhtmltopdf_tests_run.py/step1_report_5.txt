  "purpose": "Configure and run Django tests for the wkhtmltopdf package.",
  "sources": "os, sys, django.conf.settings, django.test.runner.DiscoverRunner",
  "sinks": "sys.exit(1) if tests fail",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from settings.configure() to django.setup(), then to the test runner, which executes tests and may invoke sys.exit() based on results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code. The code uses in-memory database and standard Django setup. The only potential concern is the use of sys.exit, but this is standard practice for test scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports OS and system modules, sets up Django environment with in-memory SQLite database, and runs tests for the 'wkhtmltopdf' app using Django's test runner. It handles different Django versions gracefully. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior observed. The code's purpose is to run tests, not to perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django test runner setup for the wkhtmltopdf package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs test configuration, execution, and exits based on test results, which is typical and safe.",
