{
  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network connections, dynamic code execution points like 'eval' or 'exec'.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows leading to system commands, network transmission, or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network sockets, file writes, or system calls, especially via dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, use of 'eval'/'exec', obfuscation, external network connections to suspicious domains, incomplete or empty code snippets, unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits no malicious patterns in benign samples, with no suspicious network activity or hardcoded secrets, resulting in low malware and obfuscation scores. Suspicious samples demonstrate dynamic code execution, obfuscation, external connections, and hardcoded secrets, justifying high malware (0.75), obfuscated (0.7), and security risk (0.8) scores. The confidence levels align with the evidence, and the scores are consistent with the described behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "Most code samples are benign with low security risk; however, one sample exhibits multiple malicious indicators, warranting high malware and obfuscation scores. The assessments are accurate and well-justified.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "malware": 0.75,
  "securityRisk": 0.8,
