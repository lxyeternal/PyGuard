  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, dynamic imports, environment variables, network operations, reflection, eval usage.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variable access, code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network data flow into code execution or data handling functions.",
  "anomalies": "Potential dynamic code execution, ambiguous network activity, lack of code snippets, no explicit malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports generally assess the code as benign with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The only notable point is in Report 2, which describes ambiguous and potentially suspicious behaviors but assigns a malware score of 0. Given the ambiguity and potential for misuse, increasing the malware score from 0 to approximately 0.3 would better reflect the moderate suspicion. Other reports are consistent in their low scores and reasoning. Confidence levels are high where code is reviewed, and the assessments are cautious but justified.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment is that the code is benign with minimal security risk. The only correction needed is to adjust Report 2's malware score from 0 to 0.3 to account for the described ambiguity and potential suspicion. All other scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
