  "purpose": "Provide a compatibility implementation of Python 2.7's check_output() function for environments where it is not available.",
  "sources": "Imports subprocess module; uses subprocess.Popen to execute commands and capture output.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; subprocess.Popen is used to run external commands with potential to execute arbitrary shell commands.",
  "flows": "The code executes external commands via subprocess.Popen, capturing their output and raising errors if needed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Uses standard subprocess methods.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally defines a check_output() function mimicking Python 2.7 behavior, leveraging subprocess.Popen to run commands. It captures command output, handles errors by raising CalledProcessError, and does not perform any network operations or data leaks. Usage of subprocess.Popen with arguments from external sources could be risky if misused elsewhere, but within this snippet, it is standard. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a compatibility utility for Python 2.7's check_output(), employing standard subprocess techniques without malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
