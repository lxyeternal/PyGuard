  "purpose": "Provides a compatibility function for check_output in Python 2.7 if it is not available.",
  "sources": "Imports subprocess module, reads module code and function definitions",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.Popen to execute external commands, potentially executing untrusted input if used improperly",
  "flows": "Untrusted data (if passed as command arguments) could be executed via subprocess.Popen",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code is standard for backward compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the existence of check_output, and if absent, defines a custom implementation that runs external commands via subprocess.Popen. It captures command output and raises exceptions on non-zero return codes. The implementation is straightforward, follows standard patterns, and is not obfuscated or malicious. The only potential security concern is that if the function is called with untrusted command arguments, it could execute malicious commands; however, this is a normal behavior for subprocess execution and depends on usage context. No hidden or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility implementation for check_output in Python 2.7. There is no malicious intent or malicious code present. It relies on subprocess to execute commands, which could be risky if command arguments are untrusted, but this is typical behavior rather than malicious. Overall, the code appears safe and non-malicious.",
