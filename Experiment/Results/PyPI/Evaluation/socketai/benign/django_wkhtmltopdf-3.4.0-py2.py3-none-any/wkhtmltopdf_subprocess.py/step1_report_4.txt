{
  "purpose": "Provide a compatibility implementation of Python 2.7's check_output() function for environments lacking it, wrapping subprocess.Popen.",
  "sources": "Imports subprocess module, particularly Popen, and potentially uses check_output if available.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.Popen to execute shell commands, capturing output. No data leaks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Input commands from caller passed to Popen; output captured and returned; errors raised on non-zero exit codes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. The code includes a standard pattern for compatibility with no malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if check_output exists, and if not, defines it using subprocess.Popen to emulate the same functionality. The implementation captures command output, handles errors, and raises exceptions appropriately. All subprocess calls are based on user-provided commands, which could be dangerous if the inputs are untrusted, but the code itself does not include malicious behavior. It’s a standard compatibility shim. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility utility for Python versions lacking check_output. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain threats. No malicious intent detected.",
