  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for rendering Django templates into PDFs using wkhtmltopdf, managing temporary files, and handling paths and environment variables for PDF generation.",
  "sources": "Templates rendered via Django loader, environment variables, user-supplied options, and filenames/URLs provided as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "External wkhtmltopdf command invoked via check_output, temporary files created for templates, and path manipulations for media/static files.",
  "flows": "Template rendering outputs feed into temporary files; filenames, URLs, and options influence command-line arguments; external process executes with these arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Minimal filename sanitization in content_disposition_filename, but no malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages template rendering and external command invocation, with careful argument construction. No malicious code or sabotage is evident. Potential risks stem from untrusted inputs influencing command arguments or filenames, but the code handles arguments properly. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for PDF rendering in Django, with no malicious activity or sabotage detected. The security risk is low, primarily related to external command execution with user-controlled inputs, which appears to be handled cautiously. The malware score is justified as 0, with a low risk score (~0.2-0.3) reflecting typical external process invocation considerations.",
