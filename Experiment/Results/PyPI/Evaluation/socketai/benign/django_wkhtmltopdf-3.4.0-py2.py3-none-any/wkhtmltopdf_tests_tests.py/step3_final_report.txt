  "purpose": "The code provides Django-based utilities and test cases for rendering PDFs using wkhtmltopdf, handling unicode content, temporary files, and HTTP responses.",
  "sources": "Template rendering functions, request objects, environment settings, and subprocess calls to wkhtmltopdf.",
  "sinks": "Temporary files, subprocess execution of wkhtmltopdf, and HTTP responses with PDF content.",
  "flows": "Template rendering → temporary file creation → wkhtmltopdf subprocess → PDF output → HTTP response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; subprocess calls are controlled and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django testing and utility suite for PDF generation, with proper handling of unicode, temporary files, and response headers. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. Subprocess usage is limited to wkhtmltopdf with safe arguments. The overall structure and practices align with secure, legitimate code for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified given the controlled subprocess calls and standard handling of files and responses.",
