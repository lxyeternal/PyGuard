  "flows": "Environment variable check leads to conditional import of utils",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; simple environment check and import",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports a utils module based on the presence of the 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' environment variable. It does not execute any untrusted code or perform network or file operations. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard configuration pattern used in Django projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical environment check and conditional import pattern without malicious intent. No security issues or malware detected.",
