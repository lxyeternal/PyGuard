  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code snippet is a straightforward conditional import based on the presence of the environment variable `'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'`.\n- This pattern is common in Django projects for environment-specific configuration.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The import is benign and tied to environment setup, not malicious activity.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, risk = 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious activity or security risk. The confidence is high (1).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated security risk score (0.1) for a benign pattern, perhaps to account for the fact that environment-based imports can influence application behavior. Still, no actual malicious activity detected. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 2; standard pattern, minimal risk. The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no security risk or malware detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Again, a standard pattern with a minimal security risk score assigned, which seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as expected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, possibly to reflect that environment-dependent imports can influence behavior, but not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary; the reasoning aligns with the code's benign intent.\n- The high confidence levels reflect the straightforward, non-malicious pattern.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (standard environment-based import pattern with minimal risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical environment check and conditional import pattern used in Django projects. It poses no security threat or malware risk based on the provided analysis.",
