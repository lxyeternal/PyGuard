  "sources": "Reading environment variables via os.environ",
  "sinks": "Import statement conditioned on environment variable, which could influence code execution flow",
  "flows": "Checking 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' environment variable -> conditional import of utils",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code; simple environment check and import",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the presence of 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' in the environment variables and conditionally imports all functions from a local utils module if the check passes. The import is standard and conditional, with no indication of malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The environment variable usage is typical for Django projects to determine environment setup. Overall, this appears to be standard configuration logic with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard environment-based import for a Django project with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
