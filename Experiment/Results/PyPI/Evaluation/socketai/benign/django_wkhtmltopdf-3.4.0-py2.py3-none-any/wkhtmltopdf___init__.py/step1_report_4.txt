  "purpose": "To conditionally import utilities if the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable is set, indicating a Django environment.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' from os.environ",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output channels are present; no untrusted data is being written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The environment variable check could lead to importing utils if set, but this is a standard conditional import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' and checks for the presence of 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' in environment variables. If present, it performs a relative import of utils. No data leaks, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are apparent. The import depends on environment setup but is a common pattern in Django projects. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for conditionally importing modules based on environment variables in a Django project. It does not contain malicious code or security risks.",
