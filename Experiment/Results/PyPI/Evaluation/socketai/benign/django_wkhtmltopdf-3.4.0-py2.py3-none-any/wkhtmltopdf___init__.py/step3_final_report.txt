  "sources": "Environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' in os.environ.",
  "sinks": "Import statement from .utils if environment variable is set.",
  "flows": "Check for environment variable -> import utils module.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward environment check and import.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple environment variable check and conditionally imports a local module, which is a common pattern in Django projects for environment-specific configurations. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The import depends solely on environment state, with no network activity or data leakage observed. The pattern is benign and standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical environment-dependent import pattern used in Django applications, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 or 0) are appropriate and justified given the benign nature of the code.",
