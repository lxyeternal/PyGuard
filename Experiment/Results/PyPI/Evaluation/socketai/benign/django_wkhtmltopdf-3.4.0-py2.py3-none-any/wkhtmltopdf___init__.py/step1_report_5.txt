  "flows": "Environment variable check -> conditional import",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import based on environment variable is standard; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the presence of 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' in environment variables, which is typical in Django projects to determine if the environment is configured for Django. If present, it imports all functions and classes from a local utils module. The import is conditional and does not execute any harmful code directly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The use of environment variables and imports appears to be standard practice for environment configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical environment check and conditional import for Django settings. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues are evident. It is a safe, standard pattern used in Django projects.",
