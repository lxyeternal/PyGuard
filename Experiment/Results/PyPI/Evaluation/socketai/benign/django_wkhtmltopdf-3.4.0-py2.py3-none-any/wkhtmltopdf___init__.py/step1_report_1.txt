  "purpose": "Set up environment-specific configurations by importing utils if a specific environment variable is present.",
  "sources": "os.environ, environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'",
  "sinks": "import statement that loads utils module based on environment variable",
  "flows": "Presence of 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' in environment triggers import of utils",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable to conditionally import a module is standard practice; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the existence of a specific environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'. If present, it imports everything from a local utils module. This is a common pattern in Django projects to conditionally include configuration or utilities based on environment settings. There is no evidence of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The import is straightforward and tied to environment configuration. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected. The code appears benign and intended for standard environment setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple environment check and conditional import, typical in Django projects. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present.",
