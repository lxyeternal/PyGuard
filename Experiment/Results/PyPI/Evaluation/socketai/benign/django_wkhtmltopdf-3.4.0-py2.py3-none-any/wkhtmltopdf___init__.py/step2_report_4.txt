  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting with the original code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Original Code Recap:**\n```python\nimport os\nif 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' in os.environ:\n    from .utils import *\n```\n\n**Key observations:**\n- The code conditionally imports a local `utils` module if the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` exists.\n- The import is straightforward, standard in Django projects for environment-specific configurations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code directly.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the pattern as standard, benign, environment-based conditional import.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, typical pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above; standard Django pattern.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (slightly above zero, possibly due to the conditional import, but this is standard).\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same pattern, standard conditional import.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard environment check.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Again, standard pattern.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard environment-based import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Justification\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** No, all reports agree that the code is a simple environment check and conditional import.\n- **Obfuscation:** No, the code is straightforward.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign zero, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, which seems to be a conservative default for conditional imports, but given the benign nature, this is acceptable.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** All reports correctly identify the pattern as standard Django practice, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at zero, with a very low security risk due to the conditional import pattern, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or 0, depending on strictness, but 0.1 is acceptable given the pattern)\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nThe code is a standard Django pattern for environment-specific configuration. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior is present. The reports are accurate in their conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
