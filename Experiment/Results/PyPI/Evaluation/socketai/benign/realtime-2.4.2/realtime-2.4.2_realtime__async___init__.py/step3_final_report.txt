  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution (eval), obfuscated variable names, input data handling.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage points, code execution functions, network communication (if present), environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or hardcoded secrets to sinks like eval() or network functions, indicating potential malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval(), hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious variable names, dynamic code execution, lack of code content in some reports.",
  "analysis": "Most reports identify patterns like eval() and obfuscation as suspicious, with scores reflecting moderate suspicion. Reports 2 and 5 show notable obfuscation and dynamic code patterns, justifying higher malware and obfuscation scores. Reports 1, 3, and 4 are consistent with benign code. The scores across reports are generally aligned with their descriptions, with no significant inconsistencies. The overall suspicion level is low to moderate, primarily driven by reports 2 and 5.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits some obfuscation and dynamic patterns suggestive of potential malicious intent but lacks concrete evidence of malicious payloads. The scores are appropriate and conservative, indicating low to moderate risk. No definitive malware is confirmed, but caution is advised, especially regarding eval() and obfuscation patterns.",
