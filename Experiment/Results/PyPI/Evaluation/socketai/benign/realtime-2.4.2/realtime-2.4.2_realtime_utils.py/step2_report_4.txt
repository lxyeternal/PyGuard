  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, reasoning, and scoring, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\nThe original code:\n```python\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\ndef is_ws_url(url: str) -> bool:\n    return urlparse(url).scheme in {\"wss\", \"ws\", \"http\", \"https\"}\n```\n\n- The code is straightforward: it parses the URL and checks if the scheme is in a set of allowed schemes.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation.\n- No external data sinks or side effects.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears benign and functionally correct for its purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Review each report's reasoning and scores**\n\nAll reports agree that the code is a simple URL scheme checker, with no anomalies or malicious behavior detected. Their analyses are consistent and logical.\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward implementation.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, as the code does not perform any risky operations or handle untrusted data beyond parsing.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the appropriateness of the scores**\n\nGiven the code's simplicity and the reports' reasoning, the scores seem appropriate. No report suggests any reason to raise the malware or obfuscated scores.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\nSince the code is benign, the risk score should remain at 0. The reports' conclusion of zero risk is justified.\n\n**Step 5: Check for assumptions or claims**\n\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are justified; the code only performs URL scheme validation.\n- No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are implied or present.\n\n**Step 6: Final assessment**\n\n- The code is a benign utility function.\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No modifications to scores or reasoning are necessary.\n\n**Final note:** The function is a simple, standard URL scheme checker with no security concerns.",
