  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scores.\n\n**1. Confirmation of code presence and correctness:**\n- The original code provided matches the description in all reports.\n- The function `is_ws_url` correctly imports `urlparse` and checks if the URL scheme is in `{\"wss\", \"ws\", \"http\", \"https\"}`.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident in the code.\n\n**2. Logical and reasoning flaws:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, benign, and performs a simple URL scheme check.\n- No report suggests any hidden or malicious intent.\n- The reasoning is consistent: the code only parses URLs and checks schemes, with no data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n\n**3. Scores evaluation:**\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, the code is clear.\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious behavior is present.\n- **Security risk score (0):** Correct, no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores:**\n- All reports assign a risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The function performs a simple validation without side effects, so no reason to increase the risk score.\n\n**5. Malware considerations:**\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- The function only checks URL schemes, which is a common and safe operation.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports correctly state that the code is benign and straightforward.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent across reports: all assign 0 for obfuscated, malware, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a simple utility function for URL scheme validation, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. No changes to the scores are necessary. The overall assessment confirms that this code is safe and poses no security concerns.",
