  "purpose": "Checks if a URL uses WebSocket or HTTP/HTTPS schemes.",
  "sources": "The function parses the input URL using urlparse to extract the scheme.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks; it only performs a scheme check without data leakage or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> urlparse -> scheme extraction -> scheme in {'wss', 'ws', 'http', 'https'}",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports urlparse and defines a function that returns True if the URL scheme is in the specified set. It performs a simple, safe check without side effects, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. All provided reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code does not handle untrusted data beyond parsing, and no vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident. The function's purpose is clear, and its implementation is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign URL scheme validator with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
