  "purpose": "Function to determine if a URL uses WebSocket or HTTP/HTTPS schemes",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'url' to the function",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data leads to data leak or effect; the code only parses and checks the URL scheme",
  "flows": "Input 'url' is parsed by urlparse, and its scheme is checked against a set of schemes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports urlparse from urllib.parse, defines a function is_ws_url that takes a URL string, parses it, and returns True if the scheme is one of 'wss', 'ws', 'http', or 'https'. It performs simple validation based on the URL scheme, with no input validation or other security-sensitive operations. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. There are no data leaks, malicious code, or backdoors present. The function's purpose is to identify WebSocket and HTTP(S) URLs, which is common in network-related code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple URL scheme checker with no malicious intent or security issues. It performs basic URL parsing and scheme validation, and there are no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
