  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward URL scheme checker.\n   - The code imports `urlparse` and checks if the URL's scheme is in `{\"wss\", \"ws\", \"http\", \"https\"}`.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or malicious intent are identified.\n   - No evidence of hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly describe the code's functionality.\n   - They do not identify any logical flaws or security issues.\n   - No false positives or misinterpretations are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence level is 1, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since all reports agree that the code is benign, no issue warrants a high risk score.\n   - The code performs a simple URL scheme check, which is safe.\n   - No potential vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are suggested or implied.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This aligns with the analysis that the code does not contain malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they focus on the code's actual behavior.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n- The code is a minimal utility function for URL scheme validation.\n- It does not perform any dangerous operations, nor does it process untrusted data in a harmful way.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate, confirming the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is safe, and the scoring reflects that. No changes are necessary.",
