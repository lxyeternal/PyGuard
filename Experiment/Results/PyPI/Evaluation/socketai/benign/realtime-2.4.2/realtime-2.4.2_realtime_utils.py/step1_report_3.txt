  "purpose": "To determine if a given URL uses WebSocket or HTTP/HTTPS schemes.",
  "sources": "The function reads the input parameter 'url' and passes it to 'urlparse'.",
  "sinks": "The scheme extracted from 'urlparse(url).scheme' is checked against a set of protocols.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> urlparse() -> scheme extraction -> scheme comparison against set {'wss', 'ws', 'http', 'https'}",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscation or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward URL scheme check using standard library functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The logic is simple and legitimate for URL validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for checking URL schemes. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
