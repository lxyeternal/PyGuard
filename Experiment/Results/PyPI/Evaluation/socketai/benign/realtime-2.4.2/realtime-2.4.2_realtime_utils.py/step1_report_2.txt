  "purpose": "The function determines if a URL uses a WebSocket or HTTP/HTTPS scheme.",
  "sources": "The function reads the input parameter 'url'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities in this code.",
  "flows": "Input 'url' is parsed, and its scheme is checked against a set of allowed schemes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code performs a straightforward URL scheme check without any suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'urlparse' to analyze URL schemes. It defines a function that checks whether the provided URL uses common WebSocket or HTTP/HTTPS schemes. The implementation is simple and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs. No external data sources or untrusted data handling beyond the input parameter are present. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign URL scheme checker without any malicious intent or security risks. It is straightforward and safe.",
