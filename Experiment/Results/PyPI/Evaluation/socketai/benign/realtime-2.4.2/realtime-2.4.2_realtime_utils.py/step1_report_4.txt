{
  "purpose": "Check if a given URL uses WebSocket or HTTP/HTTPS schemes",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'url' passed to the function is parsed by urlparse",
  "sinks": "The function returns a boolean value based on the scheme; no data leakage or external sinks are present",
  "flows": "Input 'url' flows into urlparse, and the scheme is checked against a set of trusted protocols",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and uses standard library functions without any suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The function is_simple, performs a scheme check against a set of common protocols including WebSocket and HTTP/HTTPS, with no evidence of malicious behavior. It does not handle untrusted input in a way that causes harm or leaks data. There are no external data sinks or obfuscated code. Overall, the code appears to serve a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, performs a basic URL scheme validation, and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
