  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of an async push notification system. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are detected. The low malware score (0) and minimal security risk (around 0.2) are justified. The code's design is typical for real-time messaging components, and external components' security depends on their implementation outside this snippet."
