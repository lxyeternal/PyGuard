  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Summary of reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup module for a real-time communication SDK.\n- They consistently note that the code performs logging configuration and static imports of internal modules.\n- No untrusted data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating the reviewers are certain about their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippet provided matches the descriptions: it only configures logging and imports modules.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The import of `realtime.version.__version__` is benign and standard for package versioning.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely setup.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are apparent in the logic or reasoning of the reports.\n- The assessments correctly interpret the code as non-malicious and safe.\n- The scores align with the observed code behavior.\n\n### Score Suggestions:\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The reasoning justifies these scores well, given the code's static, setup nature.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- **Malware (0):** No malicious activity or intent detected.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** No obfuscation or hidden code patterns.\n- **Risk (0):** No security risks or vulnerabilities identified in this setup code.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- Since the code is purely for setup and imports, any higher scores would be unjustified.\n- If future code involves dynamic execution, network calls, or handling untrusted data, re-evaluation would be necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is straightforward, standard package initialization, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with scores appropriately set to zero across malware, obfuscation, and security risk. No changes are recommended.",
