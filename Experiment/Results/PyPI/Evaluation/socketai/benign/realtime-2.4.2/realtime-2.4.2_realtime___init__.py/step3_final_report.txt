{
  "purpose": "This code initializes logging and imports modules related to a real-time communication SDK, serving as a setup or __init__ module.",
  "sources": "The code reads static module imports and configuration calls; no external or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows or could cause data leaks or security effects, as the code only performs static imports and logging setup.",
  "flows": "The code flows from static import statements to logging configuration, with no dynamic data or external interactions involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns, are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code configures logging with NullHandler to prevent logging propagation issues and imports version info along with various modules related to real-time communication. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data. The import statements are from local or standard modules, and the code's purpose appears to be package setup. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's static, benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup module for a real-time communication SDK, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
