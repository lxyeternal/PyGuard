  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**  \n   All reports conclude that the code is a straightforward setup module, performing logging configuration and static imports. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing involving untrusted sources is observed. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Code and Import Analysis:**  \n   The code only imports local modules and sets up logging with `NullHandler`. The import of `__version__` from `realtime.version` is standard for version tracking. The modules imported relate to real-time communication features, which are typical for such SDKs or libraries.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Attack Vectors:**  \n   Since the code does not handle external inputs, process untrusted data, or perform network operations, the risk of supply chain or runtime malicious activity is minimal. The absence of obfuscation and suspicious patterns further supports this.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, indicating no obfuscation.  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.  \n   - **Confidence Level:** All reports show high confidence (1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Summary of Recommendations:**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final Note:**  \nThis code appears to be a standard, safe initialization module for a real-time communication SDK, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
