  "purpose": "Assign a version string to __version__ for package identification.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or data leaks; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink exists.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment '{x-release-please-version}', which is a placeholder for automated release tools, but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple string assignment setting __version__ to '2.4.2'. The comment indicates integration with release automation tools. No dynamic code, input handling, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature. The confidence score is high (1), justified by the straightforward, standard practice of version declaration in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. All scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
