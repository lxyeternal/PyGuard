  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; code only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment referencing 'x-release-please-version', which suggests automated versioning, but no suspicious or unusual code behavior is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a version string to the variable '__version__' and includes a comment indicating the versioning scheme. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The comment may relate to automated release tools, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version assignment with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical pattern in Python packages.",
