{
  "purpose": "The code transforms WebSocket URLs to HTTP URLs by replacing the scheme and removing socket-related path segments, then trims trailing slashes.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'socket_url' which provides the URL string to be transformed.",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs the transformed URL string; no external sinks or data leaks are involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'socket_url' flows through three regex substitutions: scheme replacement, socket path removal, and trailing slash trimming, resulting in the normalized URL.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the regex patterns are straightforward, and the code performs simple string manipulations without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs three regex substitutions: replacing 'ws' or 'WSS' at the start with 'http', removing socket-related path segments at the end, and trimming trailing slashes. All operations are safe, simple, and serve URL normalization purposes. No external data access, secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The regex patterns are correct and do not introduce vulnerabilities. The code is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's benign nature. Overall, the code is a safe utility function with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward URL normalization utility that performs safe string manipulations. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
