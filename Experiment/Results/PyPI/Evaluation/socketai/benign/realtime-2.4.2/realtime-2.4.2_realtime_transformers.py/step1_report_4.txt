  "purpose": "Convert a WebSocket URL to an HTTP URL by replacing scheme and removing socket-related paths.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'socket_url' provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "Uses re.sub to modify the URL string, potentially affecting the URL's structure.",
  "flows": "Input 'socket_url' -> re.sub for scheme replacement -> re.sub for path removal -> re.sub for trailing slash removal -> output URL.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Uses standard regex substitutions for URL transformation.",
  "analysis": "The function takes a URL string, replaces the 'ws' scheme with 'http', removes specific socket-related paths ('/socket', '/websocket', '/socket/websocket') from the URL, and trims trailing slashes. The regex operations are straightforward string manipulations without external data access, command execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to serve a normal URL transformation purpose without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple URL modifications for converting WebSocket URLs to HTTP URLs, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. It is a benign utility function.",
