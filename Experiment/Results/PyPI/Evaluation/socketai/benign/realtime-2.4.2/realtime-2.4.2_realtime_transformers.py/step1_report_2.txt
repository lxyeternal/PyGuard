  "purpose": "Convert WebSocket URL to HTTP endpoint URL by modifying the scheme and removing websocket-specific path segments.",
  "sources": "socket_url parameter input, obtained from function argument",
  "sinks": "return statement outputs the modified URL; no untrusted data is used beyond input parameter",
  "flows": "Input socket_url is transformed through regex substitutions to produce a sanitized HTTP URL string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns; use of regex appears straightforward and safe",
  "analysis": "The code performs regex substitutions to replace 'ws' schemes with 'http' and remove specific websocket path segments, then trims trailing slashes. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior detected. The function is simple and focused solely on URL transformation without external network interactions or sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign URL transformation utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
