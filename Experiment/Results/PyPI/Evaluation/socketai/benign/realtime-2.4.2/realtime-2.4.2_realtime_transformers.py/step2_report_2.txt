  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe code performs three regex substitutions:\n1. Replaces the scheme prefix 'ws' (case-insensitive) with 'http'.\n2. Removes socket-related path segments ('/socket/websocket', '/socket', '/websocket') at the end of the URL.\n3. Trims trailing slashes.\n\n**Security implications:**\n- The operations are straightforward string manipulations.\n- No external network calls, data leaks, or code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- The regex patterns are simple and serve a URL normalization purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Issues Reported:\n- All reports describe the code as a URL transformation utility, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- They consistently mention the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n- The purpose, sources, sinks, and flows are accurately described.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward URL transformation utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Regarding the scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This is appropriate, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports. The code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 in all reports. The operations are safe and do not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes, the scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is safe, simple, and performs URL normalization.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign utility with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that. No changes needed.",
