  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The function performs three regex substitutions:\n  1. Replaces `ws` or `WSS` with `http`.\n  2. Removes socket-related path segments (`/socket`, `/websocket`, `/socket/websocket`) at the end of the URL.\n  3. Trims trailing slashes.\n\n- All operations are straightforward string manipulations with no external I/O, no secret handling, and no malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n\n- **Issue presence:** No, the code is a simple URL transformation utility. There are no vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n\n- **No flaws detected:** The regex patterns seem correct for the intended purpose, and the transformations are safe. No issues with the logic or implementation.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n\n- **Confidence:** All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious behavior is present.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n\n- The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. This is consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risk or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The regex patterns are simple and safe.\n- The URL transformations are standard and do not introduce security issues.\n- No external dependencies or data leaks.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a benign utility function for URL normalization with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code and the absence of any malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
