  "purpose": "Convert WebSocket URLs to HTTP URLs by replacing schemes and removing specific WebSocket-related path segments.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'socket_url' which is a string representing a URL.",
  "sinks": "The returned URL after modifications; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere within this code.",
  "flows": "Input 'socket_url' → regex substitutions to transform URL → output URL",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; the code performs straightforward string transformations using regex.",
  "analysis": "The function uses regex substitutions to change 'ws' or 'wss' schemes to 'http', remove specific WebSocket-related path segments, and trim trailing slashes. No dynamic code execution, no external data access, and no suspicious logic are present. The regex patterns are simple and serve standard URL manipulation purposes. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code appears to be a utility function for URL normalization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign URL transformation utility without malicious behavior. It safely modifies WebSocket URLs for potential use in HTTP contexts, with no indicators of security risks or malicious intent.",
