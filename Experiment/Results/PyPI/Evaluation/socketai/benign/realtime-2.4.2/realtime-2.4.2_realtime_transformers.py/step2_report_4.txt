  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core functionality: converting WebSocket URLs to HTTP URLs by replacing protocols and removing socket-related path segments.\n- The code uses straightforward regex substitutions without external data access, command execution, or complex logic.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the benign nature described.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code performs simple regex replacements; no issues or vulnerabilities are apparent.\n   - The regex patterns are straightforward and unlikely to cause unintended side effects.\n   - No evidence of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, and the code is simple URL manipulation, raising risk scores is unwarranted.\n   - No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities justify higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code's purpose.\n   - No overestimations of risk or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's functionality.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (benign URL transformation utility)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is a simple, safe URL transformation utility with no security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
