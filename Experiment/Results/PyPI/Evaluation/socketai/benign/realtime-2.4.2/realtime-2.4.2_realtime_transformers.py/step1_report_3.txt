  "purpose": "Transform a WebSocket URL into an HTTP endpoint URL by modifying its scheme and removing specific socket-related paths.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'socket_url' provided to the function",
  "sinks": "The 're.sub' functions that perform string replacements based on the input URL",
  "flows": "Input 'socket_url' -> regex substitutions -> output URL string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The regex operations are straightforward string modifications without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to convert WebSocket URLs ('ws' or 'wss') to HTTP URLs by replacing the scheme and removing socket-related path segments. It performs regex substitutions on the input string, which is a typical string manipulation task. No external data sources, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is simple and appears benign, focused solely on string transformation without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL manipulation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any obfuscation, malicious logic, or security vulnerabilities.",
