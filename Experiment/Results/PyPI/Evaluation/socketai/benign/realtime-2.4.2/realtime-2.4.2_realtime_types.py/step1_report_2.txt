{
  "purpose": "Define constants, enums, types, and classes for real-time communication and presence management in a Phoenix-based system.",
  "sources": "Constants, enum definitions, class initializers, and type annotations that do not involve external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external system interactions are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly establishes data structures and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed. The code is structured as type definitions and class setups without runtime data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of constants, enums, and class definitions for managing real-time communication states and presence. It uses standard Python practices with no external data input, dynamic code execution, or system interaction that could be malicious. No backdoors, code injection points, or suspicious behavior detected. The structure appears purely for application logic and data modeling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical set of data structures and constants for a real-time system, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as part of a larger application and does not contain any malicious or sabotage code.",
