{
  "purpose": "Define constants, enums, classes, and types for a real-time messaging and presence system, particularly for Phoenix server integration.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data structures are predefined constants, class initializations, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are explicitly present; the code mainly defines data structures and constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted sources leading to insecure sinks; the code is primarily structural definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. All variables and classes serve straightforward purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type definitions, enum classes, constants, and data structure classes designed to facilitate a real-time communication system with Phoenix. It uses standard Python features with no external inputs or suspicious behaviors. No network calls, no data leaks, no cryptographic operations, and no dynamic code execution mechanisms are present. The code appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type definitions, constants, and data structures for a Phoenix real-time messaging system. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks based on the provided code. The absence of input handling, external data processing, or execution logic indicates a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
