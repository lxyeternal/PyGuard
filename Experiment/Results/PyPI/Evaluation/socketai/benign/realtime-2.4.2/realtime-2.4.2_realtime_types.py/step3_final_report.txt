{
  "purpose": "Defines constants, enums, classes, and data structures for real-time communication and presence management in a Phoenix system.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; code reads no untrusted input or external data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; purely data definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static data structures only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type definitions, constants, enums, and classes for managing real-time channels and presence. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or runtime actions. No malicious behaviors, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose appears to be structural, supporting a Phoenix real-time system. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is zero. The slight securityRisk score of 0.1 in one report overestimates the risk; a score of 0.0 is more accurate given the benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and free of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate a safe, well-structured set of data models for Phoenix real-time communication. The appropriate scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
