{
  "purpose": "This code defines types, constants, enums, and classes for handling real-time communication, presence, and events, primarily for a Phoenix server integration.",
  "sources": "Constants and class constructors initialize configuration and data structures; no external data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network calls, file I/O, or system command executions that process untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Data flows primarily within object instances and type annotations; no external untrusted input flows are visible.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly a set of data definitions and constants for real-time event handling. All elements appear standard, with well-defined types, constants, and class structures. No hardcoded credentials, system commands, or network activity are embedded. There are no apparent data leaks, code injections, or malicious behaviors. The code seems designed for a client or server module to manage real-time states, presence, and events, with no evident security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured part of a real-time communication library or client, with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It mainly defines data models and constants without any suspicious or malicious code behavior.",
