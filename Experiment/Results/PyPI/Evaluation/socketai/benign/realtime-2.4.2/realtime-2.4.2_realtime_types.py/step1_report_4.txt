{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures, constants, and enums for managing real-time communication channels, presence, and events, primarily for use with a Phoenix real-time server.",
  "sources": "Constants, enum definitions, class constructors, and type annotations",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the code mainly defines data models and constants without executing or processing external data",
  "flows": "No executable data flow from sources to sinks, as this is mainly type and class definitions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets detected; the code is straightforward and primarily descriptive",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured definitions for real-time channel management, presence tracking, and event handling, including enums, TypedDicts, classes, and constants. It does not include any data processing, network operations, or dynamic execution. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The constants and class structures are typical for a client-server real-time communication setup. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of data models and constants for managing real-time channels and presence states. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is safe and intended for structured data handling within a real-time communication context.",
