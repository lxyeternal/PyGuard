  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious data structure with no obfuscation. The primary concern is the potential for runtime errors when hashing payloads with unhashable types, which is a correctness issue, not a security vulnerability. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, security risk=0.2 are justified. No changes are necessary; the code is safe but could benefit from input validation or type enforcement to prevent runtime errors."
