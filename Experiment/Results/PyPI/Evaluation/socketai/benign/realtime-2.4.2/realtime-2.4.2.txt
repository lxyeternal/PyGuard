      "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious data structure with no obfuscation. The primary concern is the potential for runtime errors when hashing payloads with unhashable types, which is a correctness issue, not a security vulnerability. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, security risk=0.2 are justified. No changes are necessary; the code is safe but could benefit from input validation or type enforcement to prevent runtime errors."

The low malware score (0) and minimal security risk (around 0.2) are justified. The code's design is typical for real-time messaging components, and external components' security depends on their implementation outside this snippet."
