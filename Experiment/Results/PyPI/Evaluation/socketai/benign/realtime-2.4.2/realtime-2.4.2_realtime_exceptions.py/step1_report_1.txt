  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for socket connection and authorization errors in a WebSocket client.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; exception messages are static or based on parameters passed during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or security-sensitive operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; exception classes are used for control flow and error handling only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious code behavior observed; code appears straightforward and purpose-driven.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings. Both classes are simple and only store and format error messages, with no external data processing, network activity, or code execution. No indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code serves a typical purpose in exception handling within a larger WebSocket client implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It solely provides custom exceptions for connection and authorization errors, which are standard in networked applications.",
