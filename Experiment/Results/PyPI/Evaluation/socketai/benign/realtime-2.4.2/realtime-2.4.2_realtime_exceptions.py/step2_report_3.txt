  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the original code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Presence of Issues:**\n   - The original code defines two custom exception classes: `NotConnectedError` and `AuthorizationError`.\n   - Both classes are straightforward, only storing and formatting error messages.\n   - No external data input, network activity, or code execution occurs within these classes.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n   - The code serves a typical purpose in error handling for a WebSocket client.\n\n2. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes:**\n   - The code appears correct and standard for its purpose.\n   - No logical errors, such as incorrect attribute usage or faulty string formatting, are present.\n   - The exception classes are simple and correctly implemented.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis; the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n   - No reason to adjust these scores upward or downward.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - The risk score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Malware score is 0, correctly reflecting no malicious behavior.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n\n5. **Claims about Vulnerabilities:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is for error handling only, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n   - No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; the analysis is based on the code's actual content.\n\n6. **Consistency & Additional Considerations:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and reports.\n   - Since the code is purely for exception handling, there's no basis for higher risk or malware scores.\n   - The overall assessment aligns with the reports' conclusions.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature, I would also assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exceptions for WebSocket connection and authorization errors. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores provided in the reports are accurate and reasonable.",
