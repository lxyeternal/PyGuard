  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources in the code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points involving untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data transfer within this code",
  "anomalies": "Code only defines exception classes; no suspicious or malicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code provides two custom exception classes with descriptive messages for connection and authorization errors. It does not perform any network operations, data processing, or contain any hidden behavior. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as part of a larger application handling websocket connections and authorization errors, but alone, it poses no security threat.",
