{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for WebSocket connection and authorization errors, serving error handling purposes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; error messages are generated from parameters or static strings within the class constructors.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; exception messages are constructed from safe inputs or static text, with no external data flow.",
  "flows": "Exception classes are instantiated with parameters; no complex data flow or external interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; code is straightforward and standard for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple exception classes with no external data handling, network activity, or malicious logic. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code serves a typical purpose in error management and contains no vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns. The scores are consistent with the code's content and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions for WebSocket client error handling, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
