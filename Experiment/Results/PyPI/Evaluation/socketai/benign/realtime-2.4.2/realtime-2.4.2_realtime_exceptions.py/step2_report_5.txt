  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code defines two custom exception classes, `NotConnectedError` and `AuthorizationError`.\n   - Both classes are straightforward, with constructors that accept parameters to generate error messages.\n   - No external data handling, network operations, or code execution is present.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n   - The purpose is typical for error handling in a WebSocket client context.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code appears benign, serving solely as exception definitions.\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n   - No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; exception messages are generated from parameters or static strings.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0. This aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0. No obfuscation observed.\n   - **Risk score:** 0. Since the code is benign and only defines error classes, there's no security risk.\n\n4. **Potential Issues in the Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly rate the code as benign with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n   - No report suggests any suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is purely for exception handling, its security impact is minimal.\n   - The only concern could be if exception messages are constructed insecurely, but here, messages are either static or based on parameters, which is standard.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is straightforward, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- I agree with the provided scores.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is benign and poses no security threat.",
