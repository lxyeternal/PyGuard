  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, defining two custom exception classes (`NotConnectedError` and `AuthorizationError`) with no external data handling, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The code does not contain any malicious logic, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - **Conclusion:** There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors present in the code snippets.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and serves typical error handling purposes.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior, risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - **Conclusion:** No justification exists for higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify no malware presence (`malware`: 0).\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not rely on assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are unsupported.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n- No modifications or escalations are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
