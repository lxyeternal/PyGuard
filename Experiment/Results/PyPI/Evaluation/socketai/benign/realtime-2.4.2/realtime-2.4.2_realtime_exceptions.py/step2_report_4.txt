  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the review reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines two custom exception classes: `NotConnectedError` and `AuthorizationError`.\n- Both classes are straightforward, storing message data and providing string representations.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or code obfuscation.\n- No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The purpose is standard exception handling within a WebSocket client context.\n- No evidence of malware, data leaks, or suspicious logic.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and serves its purpose in error handling.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`. Correct, since the code is clear and standard.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign `0`. Correct, no vulnerabilities or security issues are present.\n\n### Any Unreasonable Score Changes?\n- Given the code's simplicity and the thoroughness of the reports, no score adjustments are necessary.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- Since the code is purely for defining exception classes, the risk scores should remain low.\n- The reports' confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty in their benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.** It functions as a typical part of an error handling system in a WebSocket client.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are needed. The code poses no security threat, and the scores correctly reflect that.",
