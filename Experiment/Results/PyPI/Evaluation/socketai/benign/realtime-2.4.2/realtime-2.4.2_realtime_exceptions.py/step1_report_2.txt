  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for WebSocket connection errors and authorization failures",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; exceptions are instantiated with string parameters",
  "sinks": "Exception message strings used for error reporting",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exceptions with string messages; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to define standard exception classes without any suspicious or unusual patterns; no hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exceptions inheriting from Exception, with constructors and __str__ methods to generate error messages. No external data is read beyond constructor parameters. No sinks or flows involve untrusted input, and no suspicious or malicious code is present. The code's structure is straightforward and intended for error handling, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for defining custom exception classes with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply provides meaningful error messages for connection and authorization issues in a WebSocket context.",
