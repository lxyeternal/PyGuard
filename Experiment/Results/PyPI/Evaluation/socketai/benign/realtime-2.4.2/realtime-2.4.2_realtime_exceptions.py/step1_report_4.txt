  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for WebSocket connection and authorization errors",
  "sources": "Class definitions and string initializations within exception constructors",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only exception class definitions with message strings",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class structure and descriptive messages",
  "analysis": "The code contains two custom exception classes, NotConnectedError and AuthorizationError, which are used for handling specific error conditions related to WebSocket connections and authorization failures. Both classes are straightforward, with constructors that set message attributes and string representations for error messages. There are no indications of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code does not perform any input/output, network operations, or data leaks. It simply defines error types for use in larger applications.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as part of error handling logic in a larger WebSocket client application.",
