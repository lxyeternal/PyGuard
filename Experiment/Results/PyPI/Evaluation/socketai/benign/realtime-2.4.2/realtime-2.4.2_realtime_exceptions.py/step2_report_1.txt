  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the original code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The original code defines two custom exception classes (`NotConnectedError` and `AuthorizationError`) that are straightforward, with no external data processing, network activity, or code execution. All reports agree that the code is benign, with no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior. The code serves a typical purpose in error handling within a WebSocket client.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is standard, simple, and free of malicious intent. There are no logical errors or flaws in their reasoning. They correctly identify that the code is purely for exception handling and does not involve any external data flow or security-sensitive operations.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - `obfuscated`: 0  \n   These are consistent with the code's benign nature. Given the analysis, these scores seem appropriate and reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since the code is straightforward exception class definitions with no external input, no data flow from untrusted sources, and no malicious behavior, there is no justification for higher risk scores. The `malware` score of 0 is correct, and the `securityRisk` should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate. The code does not perform any malicious activity, such as executing code, exfiltrating data, or hiding behavior.\n\n6. **Claims About Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is benign and only used for error handling.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided in each report.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores (`malware`: 0, `obfuscated`: 0, `securityRisk`: 0) are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores or the reasoning.\n\n**My own estimates** after careful review:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0  \n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a standard, straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for a WebSocket client, with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.",
