{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for websocket connection errors and authorization failures",
  "sources": "No input sources; exception classes are instantiated based on program logic",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "No data flow; exception classes only define error types and messages",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes with clear docstrings and standard initialization methods. There are no hardcoded secrets, environmental variable usages, or dynamic code execution. The classes are designed solely for raising specific errors related to websocket connection and authorization failures. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes without any malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely for error handling related to websocket connection states and authorization, with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
