{
  "purpose": "This code is a static analysis tool for identifying deprecated function and method calls in Python code, specifically targeting certain old alias names for deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "Reads AST nodes representing function calls, method calls, and decorators from the input code's abstract syntax tree.",
  "sinks": "None of the identified nodes are sinks for untrusted data or security vulnerabilities; the code does not process external inputs directly or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code traverses AST nodes to identify deprecated function/method names and decorators, then generates warnings based on matches.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are present. The code performs straightforward static code analysis tasks with no obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The script loads an AST of Python code and searches for deprecated function calls, method calls, and decorators based on a predefined deprecation mapping. It reverses the deprecation data for efficient lookup. It then yields warnings with line and column info when deprecated aliases are detected. The logic is standard for static analysis tools, with no indications of malicious behavior. The code only performs read-only analysis on the AST, with no network, file, or environment manipulations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility aimed at identifying deprecated code patterns. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this script. It functions solely as a linter helper for code maintenance, with no malicious payload or suspicious behaviors.",
