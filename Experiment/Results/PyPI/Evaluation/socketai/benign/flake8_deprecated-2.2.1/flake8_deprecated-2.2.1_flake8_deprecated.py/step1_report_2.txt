{
  "purpose": "This code defines a static analysis tool that identifies deprecated function and method calls, as well as decorator names, in Python Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representations, to facilitate code modernization and maintainability.",
  "sources": "Code reads AST nodes during traversal, specifically looking at Call nodes, FunctionDef nodes, and decorator lists within functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks are present. The code does not write data, send data over networks, or perform any output that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "flows": "The code inspects AST nodes (sources) for deprecated function/method names and decorator names, generating reports (outputs) when matches are found.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward in purpose, primarily performing pattern matching on AST nodes.",
  "analysis": "The script loads AST nodes for analysis, traversing the syntax tree to identify deprecated method calls, function calls, and decorators. It constructs a reverse mapping of deprecated aliases to their replacement suggestions and reports any matches. The logic is transparent and does not include any network communication, system modifications, or code execution. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. It serves a legitimate purpose of static code analysis for deprecation warning generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis tool designed for deprecation detection in Python code. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security vulnerabilities. It focuses solely on identifying outdated code constructs to assist developers.",
