{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for analyzing Python AST trees to detect deprecated function or method calls and decorators related to specific old aliases, providing warnings for their usage.",
  "sources": "The code reads the AST tree provided during class initialization and inspects function calls, method calls, and decorators within the AST nodes.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that lead to data leaks, code execution, or system modifications. The code only yields diagnostic information about deprecated calls.",
  "flows": "The analysis flow is: AST nodes -> check for deprecated function/method calls or decorators -> yield deprecation warnings.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward static analysis of AST; no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets. No malicious logic or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static inspection of a Python AST to identify usage of deprecated functions, methods, or decorators based on predefined mappings. It reverses deprecation data for efficient lookup. The check methods compare AST node attributes with known deprecated identifiers. No external inputs, network activity, or system modifications are involved. The implementation appears safe and standard for static code analysis. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static analysis tool designed to detect deprecated API usage in Python code. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The security risk level is minimal, as it only provides warnings about deprecated code, which is a standard practice in code maintenance. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose a security threat.",
