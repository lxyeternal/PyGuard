  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states static analysis of AST for deprecated calls/decorators.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious flows; only diagnostic output.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors. The code performs straightforward pattern matching.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, low security risk, high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected. Malware score: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static analysis focus.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors; purely pattern matching.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, straightforward, with high confidence (1).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious activity. Malware score: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious code; only static pattern matching.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, very low security risk, high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malware present. Malware score: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static analysis for deprecated code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Straightforward AST pattern matching, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, no malicious intent, high confidence (1).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malware. Malware score: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static analysis focus.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No security-related data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, no security risk, very high confidence (1.0).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malware or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with a malware score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assess the code as straightforward, with an obfuscated score of 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose as a static analysis tool for deprecation detection, the security risk is minimal. The reports assign very low risk scores (~0.1), which seems appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code does not perform any network, file, or system modifications.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The purpose is purely static code analysis for deprecation warnings, a common and safe practice.\n- The scores assigned in reports align well with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** (very low, consistent with the reports, considering it's a static analysis tool with no external dependencies or malicious payloads)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, benign, and serves a legitimate purpose. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No adjustments needed. The analysis and scoring are consistent with the code's behavior.",
