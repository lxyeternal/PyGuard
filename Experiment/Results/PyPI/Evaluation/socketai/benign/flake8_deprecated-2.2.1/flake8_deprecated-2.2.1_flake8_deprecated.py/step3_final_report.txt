  "purpose": "Static analysis tool that inspects Python ASTs for deprecated function calls, method calls, and decorators based on predefined mappings.",
  "sources": "AST nodes representing function calls, method calls, and decorators in Python code.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, network activity, or external data handling; solely pattern matching and warning generation.",
  "flows": "AST nodes are traversed; deprecated function/method/decorator names are identified and warnings are yielded.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns; straightforward static pattern matching.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static AST traversal to identify deprecated API usage based on a predefined mapping. It checks function calls, method calls, and decorators for deprecated aliases, yielding warnings with line and column info. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is present. The logic is simple, clear, and safe. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected. The purpose is maintenance-oriented, not security-critical. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility for detecting deprecated API usage. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The low security risk and malware scores are justified, and the reports' assessments are accurate.",
