{
  "purpose": "The code is a static analysis tool designed to identify deprecated function and method calls, as well as decorator aliases, within Python AST trees to facilitate code modernization and maintainability.",
  "sources": "AST nodes during iteration in the run() method, specifically function call nodes (ast.Call) and function definition nodes (ast.FunctionDef), as well as decorator nodes within function definitions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain typical security sink points such as data output, network transmission, or file writing. It primarily reads and analyzes code structure for patterns indicating deprecation.",
  "flows": "The analysis flows from source nodes (function calls, decorators) to pattern matching against deprecated aliases stored in _reverse_data(). When matches are found, the error() method generates diagnostic tuples.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses no obfuscated language features, dynamic code execution, or unusual constructs. It mainly relies on standard AST traversal and pattern matching. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses AST traversal to identify deprecated method calls and decorator aliases based on predefined deprecation mappings. It reverses the deprecation dictionary for efficient lookup. The check methods compare AST node attributes to known deprecated names and yield error tuples when matches are detected. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network access, or code injection. Its sole purpose is static pattern matching for deprecation notices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, purpose-built static code analysis tool aimed at identifying deprecated code patterns for code maintenance. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It operates solely on code structure without any external side effects.",
