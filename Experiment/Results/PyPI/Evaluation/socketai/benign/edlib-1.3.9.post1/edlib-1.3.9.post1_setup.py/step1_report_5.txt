{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for building and installing the 'edlib' Python package, which involves compiling C++ extension modules, optionally using Cython.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (EDLIB_USE_CYTHON, EDLIB_OMIT_README_RST), filesystem (README.rst), package metadata",
  "sinks": "Reading README.rst file, setting up extension compilation (no untrusted data sinks evident)",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence conditional logic for Cython compilation and README inclusion; filesystem read for long description",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to control build behavior is standard; no suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code observed; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for Python package compilation with optional Cython usage. It reads environment variables to decide whether to compile from Cython source or pre-compiled C++ code. It loads a README file unless instructed to omit it. No data leaks, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The structure and logic follow standard practices for Python C extension modules, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate package setup file for building a C++ extension with optional Cython compilation. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks present in this code.",
