{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to set up and compile a Python package called 'edlib', which includes C++ extension modules for sequence alignment.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('EDLIB_USE_CYTHON', 'EDLIB_OMIT_README_RST'), file system (reading 'README.rst'), and potentially user input via environment variables.",
  "sinks": "File system access when reading 'README.rst', environment variable access, and process execution during setup. No direct data leaks or malicious sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables determine whether to compile from Cython or pre-compiled C++, influencing the source files used in the build process. Reading 'README.rst' file for long description is also a data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior detected. Use of environment variables to control build behavior is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code found.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment-based configuration for building C++ extensions, reads a README file for documentation, and sets up package metadata. All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup script for a Python extension package. It uses environment variables to control build options and reads a README file for documentation. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
