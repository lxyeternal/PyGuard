  "purpose": "Setup script for the edlib Python package, configuring build options for Cython or C++ source compilation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'EDLIB_USE_CYTHON' and 'EDLIB_OMIT_README_RST'; file system for 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "File reading from 'README.rst'; environment variables influencing build behavior.",
  "flows": "Environment variables control conditional logic for sourcing code; file I/O loads description; environment variables affect build configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to toggle build behavior is common; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code or unusual logic. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script configures the build process for a Python C extension module, optionally using Cython based on an environment variable. It reads the README file unless suppressed by an environment variable. The setup function specifies extension sources, includes, and compilation options, all standard for building Python C/C++ extensions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. All external inputs are environment variables or files, with no untrusted user input or data injection points. The code's purpose is straightforward package setup with conditional build configurations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python extension package, with environment-controlled build options and no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
