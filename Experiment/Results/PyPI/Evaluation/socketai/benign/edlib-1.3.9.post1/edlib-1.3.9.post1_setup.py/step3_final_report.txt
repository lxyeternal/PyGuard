  "purpose": "Standard setup script for building the 'edlib' Python extension module, with optional Cython compilation based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('EDLIB_USE_CYTHON', 'EDLIB_OMIT_README_RST'), file reading of 'README.rst', and the setup configuration including extension source files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; the script performs build configuration without network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence whether Cython or C++ sources are used; file reading provides long description; setup configuration proceeds accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard practices for package setup and build customization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script that conditionally uses Cython, reads a README file, and configures extension modules with standard compiler flags. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. Environment variables are used for build options, which is common. The code is clear, non-obfuscated, and free from network activity or data leaks. All signals indicate a benign, standard build process.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware and obfuscation, with a minimal security risk score reflecting standard build practices. Overall, the supply chain security is very high, and no concerns are warranted.",
