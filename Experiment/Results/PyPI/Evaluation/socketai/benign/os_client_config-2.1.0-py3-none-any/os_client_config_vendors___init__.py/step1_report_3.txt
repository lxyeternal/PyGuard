  "analysis": "The code only contains a licensing comment and a single import statement. There is no executable logic, data processing, or handling of untrusted inputs. The imported function may be used elsewhere in the larger codebase, but in this fragment, there are no security concerns or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with licensing comments, showing no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project, but this fragment alone is benign.",
