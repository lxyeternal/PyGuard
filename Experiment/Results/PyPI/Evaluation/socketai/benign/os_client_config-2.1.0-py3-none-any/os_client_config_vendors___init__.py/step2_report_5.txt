There are no signs of executable logic, data manipulation, or suspicious behaviors. The code is benign and typical for open-source projects.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is minimal and non-malicious. No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**  \n   - **Obfuscated Score (0):** Correct, as there's no obfuscation detected.  \n   - **Malware Score (0):** Correct, since there's no malicious activity.  \n   - **Security Risk Score (0):** Correct, as the code poses no security threat.\n\n   The scores are appropriate and consistent across all reports.\n\n4. **Risk Score Justification:**  \n   Since the code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security issues, a risk score of 0 is justified.
