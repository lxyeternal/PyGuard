  "purpose": "Dynamically loads and constructs service clients based on a configuration mapping, facilitating flexible SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Module names and class names retrieved from the class_mapping dictionary, which is presumed to be controlled internally.",
  "sinks": "importlib.import_module for module loading, getattr for class retrieval, and client instantiation with dynamic parameters.",
  "flows": "Module name from class_mapping → importlib.import_module → getattr to get constructor → client class instantiation with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Potential risk if 'service_key' or class_mapping entries are manipulated externally, leading to malicious module import or code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code uses controlled mappings for dynamic import and class retrieval, minimizing risk. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The primary concern is if 'service_key' or 'class_mapping' are influenced by untrusted sources, which could enable import of malicious modules. The overall pattern is standard for plugin-based SDKs, with low inherent risk if inputs are validated. The risk score should reflect the trustworthiness of 'service_key' inputs; untrusted inputs could elevate risk to moderate or high. Malware activity is not detected, and code is clear and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and follows standard dynamic import patterns. The main security consideration is ensuring that 'service_key' and related parameters are validated or whitelisted to prevent potential module hijacking. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a low malware and obfuscation score, and a moderate risk score depending on input validation practices.",
