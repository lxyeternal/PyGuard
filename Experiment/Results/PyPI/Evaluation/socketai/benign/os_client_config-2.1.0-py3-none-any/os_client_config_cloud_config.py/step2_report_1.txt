  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the described flows, and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code dynamically loads modules and constructs clients based on a controlled mapping (`class_mapping`). The risk of malicious code execution is low if `class_mapping` is secure. No obfuscation or malware signs are present.\n\n- **Assessment:** The main concern is if `class_mapping` or module names are tampered with. However, these are presumably controlled within the package. The dynamic import and attribute access are standard patterns, not inherently malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — seems reasonable given the controlled nature.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected. The dynamic import is a potential risk if the mapping is compromised, but in normal operation, unlikely.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing dynamic import and client creation. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's reliance on a controlled mapping reduces risk. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — consistent.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK configuration utility; low security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on dynamic import, attribute access, and client instantiation. Appends user agent info; no malicious activity observed.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior. The dynamic import is standard for plugin systems.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate code with minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights potential risks from dynamic import and attribute access if inputs are untrusted. No validation or sanitization shown.\n\n- **Assessment:** This is a critical point. If `service_key` is derived from untrusted sources, malicious modules could be imported, leading to remote code execution.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.6 — reasonable, given the potential for exploitation if inputs are not sanitized.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The risk is elevated due to lack of input validation. The code is not malicious but could be exploited under certain conditions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizing dynamic import and client creation. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** Assuming inputs are trusted, the pattern is standard. No evidence of malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — seems appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; low risk.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no signs of malicious code. The only concern is in Report 4, where unvalidated dynamic import could be exploited if inputs are untrusted.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected in any report.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Most are low (0.2), except Report 4, which appropriately raises to 0.6 due to potential input manipulation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** generally, with a justified increase to **0.6** in Report 4 due to potential input validation issues.\n\n**Note:** The primary concern is ensuring that `service_key` and other dynamic inputs are validated or sanitized before being used for module import and attribute access to prevent exploitation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard for dynamic import patterns assuming controlled inputs), but **up to 0.6** if inputs are untrusted.\n\nThis detailed review confirms that the code is generally safe and standard for its purpose, with the main security caveat being input validation for dynamic imports.",
