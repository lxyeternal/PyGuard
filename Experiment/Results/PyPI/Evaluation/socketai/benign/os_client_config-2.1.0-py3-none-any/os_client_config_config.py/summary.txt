  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration utility for OpenStack clouds, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects the potential exposure of configuration data, but this is expected given its purpose. The malware score is zero, indicating no malicious activity. The wildcard import is a style issue but not a security concern. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for supply chain use with minimal risk."
