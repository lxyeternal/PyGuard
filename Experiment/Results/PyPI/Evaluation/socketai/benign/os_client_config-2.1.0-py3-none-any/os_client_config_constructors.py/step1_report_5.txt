  "purpose": "Load and cache a JSON mapping from a file called 'constructors.json' with thread safety.",
  "sources": "os.path.join, os.path.realpath, open(_json_path, 'r'), json.load(json_file)",
  "sinks": "json.load(json_file) reading from a file, open() reading file content",
  "flows": "os.path.join/os.path.realpath -> open(_json_path, 'r') -> json.load(json_file)",
  "anomalies": "Use of threading.Lock for thread safety; no suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to load a JSON file containing class mappings, cache the result, and ensure thread safety using a lock. It reads from a file called 'constructors.json' located in the same directory as the script. No untrusted input handling or external network activity is present. The only data source is the local filesystem, and the only sink is reading from that file using standard libraries. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, safe file read operation with caching and thread safety measures. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
