  "purpose": "Load and cache a JSON mapping from a file called 'constructors.json' with thread safety.",
  "sources": "Reading 'constructors.json' from the filesystem when '_class_mapping' is None.",
  "sinks": "Reading from the filesystem; no untrusted data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "If '_class_mapping' is None, open and read 'constructors.json' to populate '_class_mapping', then return a copy.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious code behavior. Use of threading.Lock is standard for thread safety.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a thread-safe cache for loading JSON data from a local file. It checks if the data is already loaded; if not, it acquires a lock, loads the JSON file, caches the data, and returns a copy. No external network activity, no data leaks, no suspicious code or malicious behavior detected. The file operations and threading are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate task of thread-safe loading and caching of local JSON data. No malicious or suspicious activity identified. It appears safe and standard.",
