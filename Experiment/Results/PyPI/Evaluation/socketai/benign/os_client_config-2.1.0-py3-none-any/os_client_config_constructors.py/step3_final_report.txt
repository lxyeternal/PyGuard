  "purpose": "Load and cache a JSON configuration file ('constructors.json') from the local filesystem in a thread-safe manner.",
  "sources": "Reading 'constructors.json' file from the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads local data and returns a copy, with no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "get_constructor_mapping() checks cache -> acquires lock -> reads JSON file -> updates cache -> returns copy.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with standard threading lock and JSON loading. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple, thread-safe load of a local JSON file, caching the data for subsequent calls. It employs standard Python libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The JSON file is read only when cache is empty, and the data is returned as a copy to prevent external modification. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which is appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration loader with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
