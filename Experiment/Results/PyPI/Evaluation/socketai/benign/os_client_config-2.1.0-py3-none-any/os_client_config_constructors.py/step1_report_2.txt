  "purpose": "Load and cache a JSON mapping from a file named 'constructors.json' with thread safety.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'constructors.json' file from disk within the get_constructor_mapping() function.",
  "targets": "The JSON data loaded from the file; the cached _class_mapping variable.",
  "flows": "The function reads the file and updates the global cache, then returns a copy of the data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior. Use of threading lock and standard JSON loading are normal. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a thread-safe lazy loading pattern for a JSON file. It reads 'constructors.json' located in the same directory as the script, caches the content in a global variable, and returns a copy of the data on each call. Proper locking ensures thread safety. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward file I/O with no evident malicious intent or obfuscation. No suspicious network activity, no hidden backdoors, no hardcoded credentials, and no unsafe data handling detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard, safe file read with thread safety and caching, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
