  "purpose": "Utility functions for configuring and creating OpenStack clients, SDKs, and REST sessions.",
  "sources": "Configuration data from environment variables, configuration files, command-line arguments, and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "External SDK calls, network requests initiated during client/session creation.",
  "flows": "Sources (config/env/args) flow into SDK/client creation functions, leading to network activity during session establishment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module for OpenStack client configuration, relying on standard libraries and practices. It does not contain obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The functions wrap SDK calls for client/session creation, which inherently involve network activity but are standard for such utilities. No anomalies or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk scores around 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility module for OpenStack client setup. It poses no security risks, contains no malware or obfuscation, and aligns with standard practices. The low security risk scores are justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
