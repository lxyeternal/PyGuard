  "purpose": "Unit tests for os_client_config.get_config() verifying behavior with different options inputs.",
  "sources": "Calling get_config() with options=None and with an argparse.ArgumentParser() instance.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks; purely local function calls and assertions.",
  "flows": "Input options passed to get_config() (None or ArgumentParser) -> get_config() processes options -> returns CloudConfig instance.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, network activity, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, controlled unit test verifying that get_config() returns a CloudConfig object when called with specific options. It involves no external data, no network activity, and no obfuscation. Both tests use safe, controlled inputs, and assertions confirm expected behavior. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is present. The code's simplicity and standard testing pattern indicate a benign, supply chain-safe component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a minimal security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
