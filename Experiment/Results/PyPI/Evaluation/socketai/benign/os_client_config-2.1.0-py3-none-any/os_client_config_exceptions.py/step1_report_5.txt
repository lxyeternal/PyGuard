{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for OpenStack configuration errors, specifically related to configuration issues and version mismatches.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'exceptions' module from the 'openstack' package.",
  "sinks": "None, as the code does not handle untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a exceptions module from the openstack package and defines two custom exception classes inheriting from exceptions.ConfigException. The second class adds an attribute 'version' to indicate a version mismatch error. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. It appears to be a standard pattern for defining exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions for configuration errors in an OpenStack-related project. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
