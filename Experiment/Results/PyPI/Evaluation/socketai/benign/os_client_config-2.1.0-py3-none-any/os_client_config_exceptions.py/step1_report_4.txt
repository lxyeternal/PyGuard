{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling configuration errors in OpenStack-related code, specifically related to version mismatches.",
  "sources": "The code imports exceptions from the 'openstack' package and defines new exception classes; no external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or security-sensitive operations are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sensitive sinks; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious behavior, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions with appropriate inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions from the openstack package, then defines a new exception class 'OpenStackConfigVersionException' inheriting from 'OpenStackConfigException'. The class includes an __init__ method that stores a version parameter, indicating it is used for signaling version mismatch errors. There are no input reads, no external data processing, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The structure and content are consistent with standard exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions used for error handling in an OpenStack configuration context. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
