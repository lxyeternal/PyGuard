  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling configuration errors in OpenStack, including version mismatch errors.",
  "sources": "Import of exceptions from the openstack.exceptions module; class definitions that do not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only defines classes without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exception classes and defines two custom exception classes, one of which stores a version attribute. It is a standard pattern for error handling in Python, with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is purely structural, serving as error definitions. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores and analysis in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
