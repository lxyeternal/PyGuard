{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling configuration errors related to OpenStack, specifically version mismatch errors.",
  "sources": "The code imports exceptions from the openstack library, and the class constructor takes a version parameter.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data affects the program or leaks data; the code primarily defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "Input from the 'version' parameter flows into the exception class but is used solely for error reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code uses standard class inheritance and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a custom exception hierarchy for OpenStack configuration errors. It imports exceptions, defines a new exception class, and a subclass with an additional 'version' attribute. There are no indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The code appears standard and focused on error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in an OpenStack context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks.",
