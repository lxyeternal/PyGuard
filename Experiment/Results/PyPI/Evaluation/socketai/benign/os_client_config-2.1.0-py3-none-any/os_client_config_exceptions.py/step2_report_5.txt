  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code imports `exceptions` from the `openstack` library.\n   - Defines `OpenStackConfigException` as an alias for `exceptions.ConfigException`.\n   - Defines `OpenStackConfigVersionException`, inheriting from `OpenStackConfigException`, with an `__init__` method that stores a `version` attribute.\n   - The code is straightforward, serving as custom exception classes for configuration errors, specifically version mismatches.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present.\n   - No external network activity, data leaks, or untrusted data handling.\n   - No obfuscation or complex logic.\n   - The code is purely structural, intended for error handling.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently describe the code as standard, benign, and serving to define custom exceptions.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or security risks are identified.\n   - The reasoning in each report is sound and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty.\n   - These scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code does not perform any operations beyond class definitions.\n   - No external data inputs, no dynamic execution, no network activity.\n   - The only notable aspect is the inheritance from an external exception class, which is standard practice.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as non-malicious.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are suggested.\n\n7. **Overall Justification:**\n   - The code is standard exception class definitions.\n   - No security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Estimated Scores Based on Analysis:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews and the code's simplicity. No further action or concern is warranted.",
