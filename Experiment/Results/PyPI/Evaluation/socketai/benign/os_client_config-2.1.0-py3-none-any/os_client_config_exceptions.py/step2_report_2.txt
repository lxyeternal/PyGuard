  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward, standard exception class definitions for OpenStack configuration error handling.\n- No suspicious code, external data handling, or malicious behavior is detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate since the code is clear and standard.\n- The security risk score is 0 across all reports, which is consistent given the code's functionality.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: it imports exceptions from the openstack library and defines two custom exception classes.\n- The logic is simple, with no external inputs, data leaks, or malicious payloads.\n- The purpose is purely to define error classes, which is a common pattern.\n\n**Errors or Flaws:**\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the code or the reports' reasoning.\n- The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- The malware score of 0 is correct; no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; the code is clear.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or attack vectors are identified.\n\n**Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that importing and defining exception classes is benign, which is valid.\n- No assumptions about untrusted data or external interactions are made or implied.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python. It involves no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The import from an external library is typical and does not introduce vulnerabilities. The exception classes serve error handling purposes only.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe supply chain security incident report correctly identifies the code as non-malicious and safe. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
