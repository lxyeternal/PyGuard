  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to OpenStack configuration errors.",

  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a exceptions module from openstack and defines two custom exception classes. The first is a direct alias for exceptions.ConfigException. The second class, OpenStackConfigVersionException, inherits from the first and adds an attribute for version. There are no external data inputs, no user inputs, or untrusted data sources. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions with proper inheritance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of exception classes for configuration errors in an OpenStack context. It contains no malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is purely structural and does not perform any harmful actions.",
