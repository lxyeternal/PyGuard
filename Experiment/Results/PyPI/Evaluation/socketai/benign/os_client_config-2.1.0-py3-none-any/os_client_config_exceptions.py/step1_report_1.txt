  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for OpenStack configuration errors.",
  "sources": "Importing exceptions from the openstack library; assigning ConfigException to OpenStackConfigException; initializing OpenStackConfigVersionException with a version parameter.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to security issues; no data output or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Import of exceptions -> class inheritance -> exception initialization with a parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code structure is straightforward and standard for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exception classes from an external openstack library and defines two custom exception classes. The classes serve to categorize configuration-related errors, including a specific version mismatch exception that stores a version number. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads. No untrusted data handling, external network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, non-malicious, and serves to facilitate error handling for OpenStack configurations. No security risks or malware indications are detected.",
