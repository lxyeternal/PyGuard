  "purpose": "Load default configuration settings from a JSON file using openstack.config library.",
  "sources": "os.path.join, os.path.dirname, os.path.realpath, and defaults.get_defaults",
  "sinks": "defaults.get_defaults(json_path=_json_path)",
  "flows": "Construct JSON path from file location -> call defaults.get_defaults with this path",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; straightforward file path construction; no dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a file path for 'defaults.json' based on the script's directory and then loads configuration defaults via openstack's defaults.get_defaults method. The code uses standard libraries and a well-known openstack module without any suspicious patterns. No untrusted input or data leakage points are evident. The file path is determined at runtime based on the script's location, which is normal. There is no indication of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration loader with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply constructs a path to a JSON file and loads defaults from it using a known library.",
