  "purpose": "Load configuration defaults from a JSON file located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)) and the JSON file 'defaults.json' in the same directory.",
  "sinks": "The function defaults.get_defaults is called with the JSON path; no untrusted data is processed directly within this code.",
  "flows": "Constructs the JSON file path, then passes it to defaults.get_defaults for processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward path construction and function call. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a path to 'defaults.json' based on its own directory, then calls a known configuration loader function. It uses standard libraries and a trusted openstack module. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities within this snippet. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the external JSON file, but the code itself is benign. The malware score is zero, obfuscation score is zero, and the security risk score is very low (around 0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk. The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard configuration loader with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. The main security consideration is the integrity of the external JSON file, not the code itself.",
