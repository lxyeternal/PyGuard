  "purpose": "Package metadata declaration including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments to metadata variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__).",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; static assignments without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of ASCII art comments and static variable assignments; no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static header defining package metadata with ASCII art comments. No dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, static, and metadata-only. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code poses no security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package metadata header with no malicious or obfuscated content. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No changes are necessary.",
