  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'rake-nltk' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, and license information.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements that assign string literals to package metadata variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted input or data",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only assigns static strings to variables",
  "anomalies": "None; the code appears to be straightforward package metadata definitions without obfuscation or hidden code",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments setting metadata attributes for the package. There are no function calls, data input/output operations, network communications, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials beyond author contact, and no suspicious or malicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only package metadata definitions with static strings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a standard header for a Python package.",
