  "purpose": "Implementation of the Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE) algorithm for extracting keywords from text.",
  "sources": "Input text to extract keywords from, internal tokenization functions, and user-provided stopwords or punctuations.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly involve untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input text -> tokenization -> phrase generation -> frequency and degree calculations -> ranking.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks detected. The code is well-structured and uses standard NLP libraries. No external or hidden network activity, system modification, or data theft observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard NLP implementation of RAKE with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. It uses typical libraries (nltk) and data structures for keyword extraction. It does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. No unusual or malicious code patterns are present, such as hidden backdoors, credential leaks, or remote command execution. The only potential concern is reliance on external NLP libraries, but that is normal for such tasks and not malicious. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for legitimate keyword extraction.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward implementation of a keyword extraction algorithm with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It is a standard NLP utility relying on common libraries, with no suspicious or malicious features.",
