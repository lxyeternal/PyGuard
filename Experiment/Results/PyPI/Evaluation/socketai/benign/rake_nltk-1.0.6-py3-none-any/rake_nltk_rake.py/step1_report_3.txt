  "purpose": "Implementation of the Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE) algorithm for extracting keywords from text documents.",
  "sources": "Input text provided to extract_keywords_from_text() and extract_keywords_from_sentences(); stopwords and punctuations from parameters or defaults; nltk's stopwords, sent_tokenize, and wordpunct_tokenize.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that send data externally, process data internally for keyword ranking.",
  "flows": "Text input → tokenization → phrase generation → frequency and co-occurrence calculation → ranking → output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code structures. The code uses standard libraries and functions without obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of the RAKE algorithm utilizing nltk and Python collections. It defines classes, methods, and data structures for tokenization, phrase generation, frequency and degree calculation, and ranking. No hardcoded secrets, no network connections, nor data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of nltk libraries and typical data structures suggests normal operation. All data processing occurs locally within the class methods; no external data flows or hidden behaviors are detected. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscated or dynamic code execution; it relies on standard library functions and safe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a keyword extraction algorithm, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It only performs local text processing using publicly available libraries without external communication or suspicious operations.",
