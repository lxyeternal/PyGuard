  "purpose": "Implementation of Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE) algorithm for extracting keywords from text.",
  "sources": "Reads input text, uses nltk stopwords, tokenizes sentences and words, processes phrases.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input into external systems or leak data; no network operations or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Input text -> sentence tokenizer -> word tokenizer -> phrase generation -> frequency and degree calculations -> ranking of phrases.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden functions. The code relies on external libraries like nltk without any suspicious network calls or data leaks. The code appears standard for NLP keyword extraction.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a RAKE implementation with standard NLP processing steps: tokenization, stopword removal, phrase generation, and scoring based on word co-occurrence metrics. It utilizes nltk for language-specific stopwords and tokenization, which is a common and safe practice. No functions or methods interact with external systems, network, or filesystem beyond basic tokenization and data processing. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or credentials. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or code that would exfiltrate data or harm the system. The code's structure is consistent with open-source keyword extraction algorithms, and no obfuscated or malicious logic is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard implementation of the RAKE algorithm for keyword extraction. It performs NLP tasks using common libraries without any malicious or suspicious behaviors. No malware or security risks are detected. The code appears safe and intended for legitimate NLP processing.",
