  "purpose": "Implementation of Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE) algorithm for extracting keywords from text.",
  "sources": "Text input, stopwords, punctuations, tokenized sentences and words.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or malicious data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Text -> Sentence tokenizer -> Word tokenizer -> Phrase generation -> Frequency and degree calculation -> Ranking scores.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard NLP processing using nltk, generating phrases, calculating word frequencies and co-occurrences, and ranking phrases based on selected metrics. No external network activity, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The implementation is straightforward, relying on common libraries, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of RAKE for keyword extraction. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior is detected. The assigned malware score of 0 and security risk score of 0 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
