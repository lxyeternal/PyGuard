{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal Python module setup with documentation and import statements for the 'rake' functionality in an NLP library.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .rake import Metric, Rake' as the code reads this local module; no external data sources or inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code contains only static documentation and import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code does not process or transfer data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module with UTF-8 declaration, ASCII art, documentation, and a local import. It contains no executable logic, external interactions, or data handling. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
