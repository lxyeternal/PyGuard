{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up and document the usage of a module called 'rake-nltk', which is likely used for keyword extraction or related NLP tasks.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input or data dynamically; it imports modules and contains comments and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink functions or code that processes untrusted data; no network or file output is performed.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The comments and structure appear standard for a Python module.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a straightforward Python module with licensing comments, ASCII art, a docstring explaining usage, and an import statement. It does not execute any logic or process untrusted input. The import of 'Metric' and 'Rake' from a local package indicates modular design but no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code’s purpose appears to be to provide a library interface for Rake-based NLP tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, primarily consisting of documentation and import statements with no malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks detected.",
