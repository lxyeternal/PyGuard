  "purpose": "To provide an interface for the rake-nltk module, enabling keyword extraction using the Rake class.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.rake' (Metric, Rake). No external data input or user data read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only module import and class references.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import and documentation string; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a UTF-8 encoding declaration, an ASCII art banner, a module-level docstring describing usage, and an import statement. There are no dynamic executions, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. The code is clean, straightforward, and typical of a module interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module import and documentation snippet with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
