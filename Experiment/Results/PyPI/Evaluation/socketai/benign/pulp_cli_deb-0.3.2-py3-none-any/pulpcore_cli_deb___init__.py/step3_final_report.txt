  "purpose": "Defines a CLI command group 'deb' and attaches subcommands related to Debian content management in Pulpcore.",
  "sources": "Imports command modules and registers them with the 'deb' CLI group.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules to registering subcommands within the 'deb' group, with no data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI setup module that imports command modules and registers them under a 'deb' command group. It uses standard patterns with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The purpose is purely organizational, and no security risks or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI command registration module with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its safe and standard nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
