  "purpose": "Define a Flake8 plugin for type checking with configurable options and rules.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, reads plugin configuration options, and processes plugin logic.",
  "sinks": "Uses plugin options and error codes to decide whether to emit warnings; no direct data sinks indicating malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Reads configuration options -> processes errors -> decides whether to warn based on rules and options.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or hidden behavior detected. The code follows standard plugin patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a Flake8 plugin class with methods to add options and run checks. It manages plugin options securely, performs typical error filtering, and logs warnings. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious data exfiltration, or harmful commands are present. The code appears to be a standard plugin setup without malicious intent or dangerous behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of a Flake8 plugin for type checking with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It manages options, runs checks, and logs info, all within expected boundaries for such a plugin.",
