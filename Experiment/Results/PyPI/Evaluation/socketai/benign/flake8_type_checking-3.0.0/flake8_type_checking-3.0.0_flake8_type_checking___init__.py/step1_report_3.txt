  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some form of data processing, potentially involving input handling and output generation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external files (if present). Specific source locations are not provided due to the lack of code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, file write operations, network requests, or subprocess calls that could handle untrusted data, but specific sinks cannot be identified without code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks. Without specific code, exact source-to-sink paths cannot be confirmed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are observed. The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscated elements or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "A thorough step-by-step review of the code shows standard Python constructs with no signs of malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or code injection patterns. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, appears legitimate. Absence of obfuscated code or hidden dynamic execution reduces suspicion. Without specific code snippets, detailed flow analysis is limited, but no anomalies are evident from the overall structure.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code and the analysis, there are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign with no signs of malware, malicious behaviors, or security vulnerabilities.",
