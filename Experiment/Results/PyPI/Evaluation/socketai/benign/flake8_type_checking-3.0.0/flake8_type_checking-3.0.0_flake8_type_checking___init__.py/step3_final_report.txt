  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, environment variables, network calls, dynamic evaluation functions (eval, exec).",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network communication, file modification, environment variable access, dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables flow into evaluation or network functions, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic evaluation (eval/exec), obfuscated code, network activity, hardcoded credentials, ambiguous variable names, unusual imports or functions.",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose was inferred based on descriptions; suspicious features include dynamic evaluation, network activity, obfuscation, and potential data exfiltration. No concrete code snippets limit definitive conclusions. Reports 1-4 indicate benign behavior with low malware and security risk scores, consistent with their assessments. Report 5 describes suspicious patterns, justifying higher obfuscation (0.6), malware suspicion (0.4), and security risk (0.6). The scores align with the described features, indicating moderate suspicion but not confirmed malicious intent. The confidence levels reflect the limited information, with higher confidence in suspicious reports. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the analysis, with minor adjustments possible if code details are available.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign with low malware and obfuscation scores, aligning with their descriptions. Report 5 shows moderate suspicion justified by described suspicious features. Scores are appropriate; minor adjustments could be made with concrete code. Overall, the assessment indicates low to moderate risk, with the highest concern in report 5 due to dynamic evaluation and network activity.",
