  "purpose": "Define type annotations and protocols for static analysis of Python AST nodes.",
  "sources": "import statements, type annotations, class definitions, and type aliases",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data processing or external data handling occurs",
  "flows": "None; the code only defines types and protocols without data flow logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious constructs observed; code is purely structural and for static analysis",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features and typing modules, and defines several protocols for static type checking and AST node analysis. No data input, external communication, or dynamic execution is present. It appears to be a static, structural code setup for a larger analysis system. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup for static analysis and type annotation. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
