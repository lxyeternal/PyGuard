  "purpose": "Define type hints, protocols, and type aliases for static analysis or type checking in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports modules and defines type-related classes and aliases.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs involving untrusted sources to sinks; this is purely type annotation setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behavior; the code is standard for type hinting and static analysis preparation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for forward references, sets up type checking imports inside TYPE_CHECKING block, defines several type aliases for AST nodes, and declares protocol classes for static type checking. No external data processing, no dynamic execution, no suspicious code patterns. It appears to be a boilerplate setup for a larger static analysis tool or plugin.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static type annotation foundation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
