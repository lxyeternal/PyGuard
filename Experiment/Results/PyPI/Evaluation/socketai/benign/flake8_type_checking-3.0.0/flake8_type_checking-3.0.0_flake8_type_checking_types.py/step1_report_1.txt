{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations, protocols, and type-related constants for static analysis and type checking in Python, especially for AST nodes.",
  "sources": "The code reads type annotations, imported modules, and type definitions; no external data sources are accessed during runtime.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; primarily static type and protocol definitions with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only type annotations and protocol definitions; no unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing and AST modules, defines Protocol classes for type hinting, and declares a type alias for 'ImportTypeValue'. It is purely for static type checking and does not execute any logic at runtime. There are no input/output operations, network calls, or data manipulations, and no obfuscated or malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard static typing setup for Python code analysis, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves as a foundation for other static analysis or linting tools.",
