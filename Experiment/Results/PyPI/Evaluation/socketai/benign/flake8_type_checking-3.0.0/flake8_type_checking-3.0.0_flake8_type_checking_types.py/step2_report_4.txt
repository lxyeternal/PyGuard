  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Purpose**:\n   - The code is purely for static type annotations, defining protocols, type aliases, and conditional imports for type checking.\n   - No runtime logic, data processing, network calls, or I/O operations are present.\n   - The code includes no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Review of the Reports**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and intended for static analysis or type checking.\n   - No external data sources, sinks, or data flows involving untrusted data are detected.\n   - No anomalies, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which is consistent with the code content.\n\n3. **Logical Consistency & Scoring**:\n   - The scores across reports are consistent and justified given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The high confidence (1.0) in all reports is appropriate.\n   - Since no malicious or suspicious elements are detected, the malware score remains at 0.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, aligning with the straightforward, clear code.\n   - The overall security risk is 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions**:\n   - All assessments are based on static analysis of the provided code snippet.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious intent are warranted given the code's nature.\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic or network operations, so no runtime risks are implied.\n\n**Conclusion & Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a standard static type annotation setup with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and accurate.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the consensus among the reports.",
