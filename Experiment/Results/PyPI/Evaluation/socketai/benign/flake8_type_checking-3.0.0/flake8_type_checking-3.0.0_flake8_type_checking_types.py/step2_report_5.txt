  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is solely for static type annotations, protocol definitions, and type aliases.\n- No runtime data processing, external data sources, or network activity are involved.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The code uses standard practices such as conditional imports under `if TYPE_CHECKING` to avoid runtime overhead.\n- The purpose appears to be to facilitate static analysis or linting tools related to Python AST nodes.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any logic that could be malicious.\n- The use of `Literal`, `Union`, and `Protocol` is standard for type hinting.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code is well-structured and aligns with common static analysis setup patterns.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is consistent with the analysis. No malicious behavior is detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate since the code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0.0, which makes sense given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No changes are necessary; the scores reflect the actual nature of the code accurately.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard static type setup with no security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed assessments and the nature of the code.",
