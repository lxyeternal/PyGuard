  "purpose": "Define type annotations, protocols, and type aliases for static analysis and type checking in Python.",
  "sources": "Imported modules: __future__, typing, ast, collections.abc; no user input or external data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is solely defining types and protocols.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code only contains type annotations and protocol definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code uses conditional import for type checking, defining protocols and type aliases for static analysis. No runtime data handling, user input, or network operations are present. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code is purely for static type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard set of type annotations and protocols intended for static analysis purposes. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies detected.",
