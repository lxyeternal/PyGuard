{
  "purpose": "The code defines static type annotations, Protocol classes, and type aliases for AST node analysis, intended solely for static type checking and linting purposes.",
  "sources": "Conditional imports within 'if TYPE_CHECKING' for type annotations; no data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data processing; the code does not handle or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of type annotations, Protocol class definitions, and type aliases used for static analysis of AST nodes. It employs standard practices such as conditional imports to avoid runtime overhead. There are no runtime operations, external data handling, or network interactions. The code is free from obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate benign static type setup, with no suspicious or malicious elements present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static type annotation setup with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports correctly assess the code as safe, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The analysis confirms that the code is safe and standard for static analysis purposes.",
