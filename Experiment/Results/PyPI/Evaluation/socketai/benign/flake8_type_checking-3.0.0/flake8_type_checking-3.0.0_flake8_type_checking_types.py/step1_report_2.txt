  "purpose": "Define type annotations and protocols for static analysis of Python AST nodes and type checking.",
  "sources": "Import statements and type annotations used for static type checking, mainly at the start of the code.",
  "sinks": "No data is processed or transmitted; the code only defines types and protocols.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; just type annotations and protocol definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists of type hints, conditional imports for type checking, and class protocols. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for type checking and conditionally defines protocols and type aliases for static analysis purposes. It includes conditional imports under 'if TYPE_CHECKING' to avoid runtime overhead, which is standard practice. No executable code or data handling is present. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for static type annotations and protocol definitions related to AST analysis. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious constructs.",
