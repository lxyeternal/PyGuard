  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is purely for static type annotations, protocol definitions, and type aliases related to AST analysis. There are no runtime operations, data processing, or external interactions. The code appears standard and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports consistently state that the code is benign, with no suspicious or malicious content. Given the code's nature, this assessment is accurate. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's static, non-executable nature.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation present.  \n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk or Malware Scores**:  \n   Since the code is purely for static analysis and contains no executable or network code, a higher malware or risk score isn't justified. The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious or pose security threats.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign and purely structural.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0.0\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a standard static type annotation setup for Python AST analysis. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign.\n\n**Recommendation**:  \nNo changes needed. The current scores and analysis are justified and accurate.",
