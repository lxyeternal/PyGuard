  "purpose": "Extracts all annotation expression nodes from a given function AST node, including parameter and return annotations.",
  "sources": "Function argument annotations (args.args, args.kwonlyargs, args.posonlyargs), optional argument annotations (args.kwarg, args.vararg), and return annotation (node.returns).",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "The function iterates over argument annotations and yields them; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, uses standard library modules, and performs static AST traversal without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility that traverses a function's AST node to yield all annotation nodes. It uses itertools.chain to combine argument lists and checks for optional annotations and return annotations. No external data handling, network activity, or side effects are present. The code is clear, correct, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative. The scores reflect the safe nature of the code, and no further action is needed.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
