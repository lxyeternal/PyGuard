{
  "purpose": "The function iter_function_annotation_nodes is designed to extract all annotation expression nodes from a given function node, either asynchronous or regular.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the input parameter 'node' which is a function node (AsyncFunctionDef or FunctionDef), and its attributes such as args.args, args.kwonlyargs, args.posonlyargs, args.kwarg, args.vararg, and returns.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it does not write, send, or execute any untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the input 'node' to the iteration over its arguments and annotations, yielding annotation nodes. No external data or user input is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generator function that iterates over the annotation nodes within a function node. It uses itertools.chain to combine argument lists and then yields annotations if present. The code only manipulates AST nodes and does not perform any dangerous operations. The use of type hints and the check for 'TYPE_CHECKING' is standard for type annotations in Python. No external or untrusted data sources are accessed, and no side effects or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe utility for extracting annotation nodes from function AST nodes. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is a simple, well-structured code fragment intended for static analysis or AST processing.",
