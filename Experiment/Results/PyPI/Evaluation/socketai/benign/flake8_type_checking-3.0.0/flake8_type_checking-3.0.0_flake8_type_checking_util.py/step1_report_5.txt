{
  "purpose": "Utility function to iterate over annotation nodes within function definitions in an AST.",
  "sources": "No input sources such as user input, network, or environment variables are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not perform data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; the code solely processes AST nodes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a type-annotated generator function that traverses AST nodes for function annotations. It imports standard modules and employs type hints and conditional imports for type checking. The logic iterates over different argument categories within a function node, yielding annotation expressions, and includes a check for the return annotation. All operations are static and related to AST processing, with no dynamic execution, data leakage, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for AST analysis, with no malicious intent, no external data handling, and no security risks identified. It appears to be benign and purely for static code analysis purposes.",
