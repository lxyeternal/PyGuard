  "purpose": "Define a generator function to iterate over annotation nodes within function definitions in an AST.",
  "sources": "Input AST nodes (AsyncFunctionDef or FunctionDef) passed to iter_function_annotation_nodes.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data outputs; purely processes AST nodes in memory.",
  "flows": "Reads annotations from function node arguments and return annotations; no external data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility to traverse and yield annotation nodes within function definitions in an AST. It uses standard library functions and type hints, with no external dependencies or dynamic code execution. The logic is simple: iterate over argument lists and return annotations, yielding non-None annotations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or hidden behaviors. It appears to be a benign, well-structured utility function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe utility for AST processing with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply traverses function annotations for analysis purposes.",
