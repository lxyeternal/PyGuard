{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a static analysis or linting tool designed to enforce code style and best practices for Python code, specifically related to type-checking, imports, and annotations.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'builtins' module, the 'flake8' module, and some hardcoded constants and strings within the script itself.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data could leak or be manipulated maliciously. The code primarily defines constants, imports, and error message templates.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules, defining constants and configurations, and setting up error message templates. There are no dynamic data flows or external inputs that could be exploited.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. The code does not include obfuscated logic, dynamic execution, or access to external data sources. It mainly sets up static data and configurations.",
  "analysis": "The script is a static code analysis configuration for a linter or type-checking tool, defining constants, error codes, and some environment setup. It does not perform any runtime operations or data processing that could be malicious. The imports are standard, and there are no signs of hidden or malicious logic. The use of enums and constants appears normal for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration and utility setup for a static analysis tool with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines constants, import rules, and error messages to be used elsewhere. No indicators of malware, data leakage, or malicious activities are present.",
