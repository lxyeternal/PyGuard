{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a static analysis or linting script for Python code, specifically targeting type-checking and import organization issues, with no apparent operational functionality beyond code analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports builtins and flake8; defines constants, sets, classes, and error message templates. Does not read external user input or network data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform data leakage. No output or network transmission code present.",
  "flows": "The code mainly initializes constants and classes, with no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The code structure is consistent with static analysis tooling.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up environment checks, defines error codes, and prepares data structures for analyzing Python source code, specifically for type hinting and import organization. It includes version checks, built-in name sets, and enum classes for error handling. No external input processing, network communication, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a static analysis tool component, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It does not perform any operations that could harm or exploit a system; it merely prepares for code analysis tasks.",
