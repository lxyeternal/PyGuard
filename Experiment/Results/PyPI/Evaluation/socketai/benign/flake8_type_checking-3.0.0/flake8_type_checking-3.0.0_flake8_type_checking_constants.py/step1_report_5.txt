{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a static analysis or linting utility focused on enforcing type checking and import organization conventions in Python code, particularly with respect to third-party and built-in modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads static module names, version information from the 'flake8' package, attributes related to imported modules and type annotations, and predefined constants and enums.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input are evident; the code mainly deals with static data and configuration for linting checks.",
  "flows": "The code uses static data (module names, version tuples, attribute lists) for analysis but does not process external input dynamically; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious dynamic behavior. The code uses standard Python features, enums, and constants for static analysis.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed as a static analysis tool, with predefined constants, version checks, and module name sets to detect import organization issues and type hinting practices. It does not perform any runtime actions, network communication, or data manipulation that could be malicious. The presence of error code definitions suggests an intent for code quality enforcement rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign static analysis utility focusing on code style and type hinting practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
