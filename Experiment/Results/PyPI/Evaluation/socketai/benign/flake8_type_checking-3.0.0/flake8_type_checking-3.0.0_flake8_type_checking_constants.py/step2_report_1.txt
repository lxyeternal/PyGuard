  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- **Reports 1-5:** All describe the code as a static analysis or linting utility for Python, focused on enforcing import organization, type hinting, and code style. They emphasize that the code only sets up constants, error messages, version checks, and static configurations. No dynamic execution, external data processing, or malicious behavior is identified. All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, with high confidence (1.0).\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step review:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or behavior:**\n   - The code is purely static, involving imports, constants, enums, and error message templates.\n   - No code executes untrusted inputs, interacts with external systems, or performs network/file operations.\n   - No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**\n   - No logical flaws are evident; the analysis correctly identifies the code as static configuration for a linter.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - Malware score: all zero, consistent with the analysis.\n   - Obfuscated score: all zero, correct given the code clarity.\n   - Risk score: all zero, justified since no security issues are present.\n   - Confidence: high (1.0), appropriate given the evidence.\n\n4. **Potential issues or overlooked points:**\n   - The code does not contain any hidden or malicious logic.\n   - The error codes and constants are standard for static analysis tools.\n   - No signs of supply chain attack or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Overall justification:**\n   - The code is a legitimate part of a static analysis utility.\n   - No malicious or security-compromising behavior is detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity or code.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, static, and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** **0** — no security vulnerabilities or attack vectors identified.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is standard for a static analysis tool setup.\n- No need to increase any scores; the current scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, purely static, and intended for code quality enforcement. The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo changes are necessary.",
