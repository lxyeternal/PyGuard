{
  "purpose": "This code sets up constants, error messages, version checks, and static configurations for a Python static analysis or linting utility, primarily related to import organization and type hinting enforcement.",
  "sources": "Imports from builtins and flake8, module version string, predefined constants, and error message templates.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external inputs or perform runtime operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow or execution paths involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code execution, external data handling, or obfuscation; straightforward static setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, involving import statements, version checks, constant definitions, and error message templates. It does not execute untrusted inputs, perform network or file operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious logic. All indicators point to a benign static analysis configuration for a Python linter. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's structure and purpose are transparent and standard for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration module for a Python linting utility, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
