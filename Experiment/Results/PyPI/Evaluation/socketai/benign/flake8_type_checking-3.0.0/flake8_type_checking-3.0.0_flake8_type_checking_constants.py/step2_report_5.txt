  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, code logic, and scoring consistency.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is static analysis tooling for Python, mainly defining constants, error codes, version checks, and configuration data.\n- No external inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n- The code relies on standard libraries and the flake8 package for version info.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### 1. **Presence of malicious code:**\n- **Confirmed:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or supply chain attacks.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n\n#### 2. **Errors, flaws, or logical mistakes:**\n- The code appears well-structured and consistent.\n- No logical flaws or anomalies are reported or observed.\n- Error code definitions and constants are standard for static analysis tools.\n\n#### 3. **Scores and their reasonableness:**\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the static, configuration nature of the code.\n\n#### 4. **Risk justification:**\n- Since the code is purely static configuration and setup for a linter, the risk score should be **0**.\n- No reason to assign higher scores, as there's no active or passive malicious activity.\n\n#### 5. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n- The reports do not seem to make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as static analysis setup.\n- No overestimations of risk or malicious intent.\n\n#### 6. **Score consistency:**\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The scores are appropriately conservative, reflecting no threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risk or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is a standard static analysis setup for a Python linter, with no signs of supply chain compromise.\n- The consistent scoring across reports is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n**The code is benign, static configuration for a linter, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.**\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|--------|\n| 0         | 0            | 0      |\n\nThis aligns with all evidence and analysis.",
