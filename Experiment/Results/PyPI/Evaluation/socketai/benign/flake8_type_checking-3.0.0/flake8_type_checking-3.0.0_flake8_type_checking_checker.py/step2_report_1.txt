  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, obfuscation, logical consistency, and alignment of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a static analysis tool focusing on annotations, imports, and scope, with no indication of dynamic or malicious activity.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No code execution, network, or data leaks; purely static AST analysis.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is complex but transparent, designed for static inspection.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully aligned; high confidence, malware score 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, security risk 0.0.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on static AST parsing, scope, and annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime code execution or external communication; purely static.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code structure is complex but standard for static analyzers.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully aligned; malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, security risk 0.0.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a static analysis framework with complex scope and symbol management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime execution or external data transfer; static AST traversal.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, malicious code, or sabotage detected. The complexity is typical for static analyzers.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully aligned; malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, security risk 0.0.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on import and annotation analysis, with extensive static logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No code injection, network, or file operations; static AST analysis.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. Uses standard static analysis patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Scores are appropriate; malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, security risk 0.1 (slightly higher but still low and justified given the static nature).\n\n**Verdict:** The security risk score of 0.1 is acceptable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static analysis focus, with framework-specific handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dynamic code execution or external communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious intent; complex but transparent static code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Scores are consistent; malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, security risk 0.2 (still low and justified).\n\n**Verdict:** The scores align well.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All zero, consistent with the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All zero, no signs of obfuscation or hiding.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low (0.0 to 0.2), justified given the static analysis context.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and align with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided reports.\n- The high confidence levels and zero malware/obfuscation scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — Clear, well-structured static analysis code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — Slightly higher due to the potential for misinterpretation in dynamic contexts, but overall very low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate. The code appears to be a legitimate static analysis tool with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
