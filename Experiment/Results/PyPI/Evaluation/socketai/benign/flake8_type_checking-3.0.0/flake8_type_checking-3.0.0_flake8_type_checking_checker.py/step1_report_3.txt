{
  "purpose": "The code defines a comprehensive static analysis framework for Python code, focusing on import mapping, type annotation handling, scope management, and various linting checks related to type hints, imports, and runtime vs. static analysis distinctions.",
  "sources": "Sources include AST nodes for imports, function and class definitions, annotations, constants, scope lookups, and specific visitor patterns for annotations, types, and scope-based symbol resolution.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve string parsing of annotations, scope lookups, import resolution, and symbol referencing. No explicit data leaks, code injections, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Code reads AST nodes (import statements, function/class definitions, annotations, constants), performs scope and name resolution, visits annotation nodes, and tracks usage to determine static vs. runtime references. Flows involve symbol registration, import classification, annotation parsing, and error reporting based on usage patterns.",
  "anomalies": "There are no overt anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network connections. The code employs standard patterns for AST traversal and static analysis. No obfuscation or misleading variable usage detected. No malicious behavior or sabotage apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code employs AST visitors and scope management to analyze Python modules for type annotation correctness, import usage, and potential misconfigurations. It tracks symbols, handles special cases like type aliases, 'TYPE_CHECKING' blocks, and third-party library support. It also provides various checks for type hint correctness, import usage, and proper quoting. No malicious code or sabotage is detected; all logic appears to be aligned with static analysis and linting purposes. It operates solely on AST structures, with no external system calls or network activities. The structure and methods are consistent with standard static analysis tools.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a sophisticated static analysis framework aimed at linting and checking Python code for import usage, annotations, and scope correctness. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. The logic is complex but consistent with static analysis, and no malicious intent is evident.",
