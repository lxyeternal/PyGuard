{
  "purpose": "The code is a static analysis tool for Python, focusing on import management, scope, annotations, and type checking. It operates solely on AST traversal without executing code or performing runtime actions.",
  "sources": "Reads AST nodes for imports, annotations, scope, and symbol definitions; no external data input or dynamic sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no code execution, network communication, or data leaks occur.",
  "flows": "Static AST traversal and symbol resolution; no runtime data flows or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or sabotage. The code is complex but transparent, typical for static analysis tools.",
  "analysis": "The code performs extensive static AST analysis, managing symbol tables, scope, and annotations, with no indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation. It does not execute dynamic code, connect to networks, or manipulate files. The complexity is consistent with a static analysis framework, and all signals point to a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate static analysis plugin with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0.0, obfuscated score is 0.0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), justified by the static nature and lack of external interactions.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
  "malware": 0.0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
