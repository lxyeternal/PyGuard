  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the assessments are accurate, consistent, and justified based on the provided code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report concludes that the code is a static analysis plugin with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. It emphasizes the code's structure, extensive use of AST parsing, scope management, and symbol resolution, all typical for static analysis tools.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code does not execute dynamic code, connect to networks, or manipulate files. It is purely AST-based, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n- **Malware score justification:** 0.0 is appropriate. No malware or malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — high confidence, as the analysis aligns with the code's static nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's static analysis purpose, AST traversal, and lack of malicious activity. It notes the code's complexity but finds no signs of malware or sabotage.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code operates solely on static AST data, with no dynamic execution or external communication.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — justified.\n\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the code's focus on import mapping, scope, and annotation handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior. It notes the code's complex but legitimate static analysis logic.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is aligned with the code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or sabotage.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — very high confidence, considering the detailed static analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the code's static analysis purpose, emphasizing import management, annotations, and scope resolution. It notes no malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage, with the code operating solely on AST data.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code does not perform runtime operations or external interactions.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — justified.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, given the static nature.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing the code's role in static analysis, import usage, and framework-specific patterns, with no signs of malicious activity. It notes the code's complexity but justifies it as necessary for its purpose.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code's mechanisms are typical for static analysis tools.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — still low, given no runtime or external activity.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of malware or malicious actions:** No, all reports agree that the code is a static analysis tool with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; the code is complex but transparent in its static analysis purpose.\n\n- **Risk scores:** All are correctly set to 0.0 or very low, reflecting the absence of security threats.\n\n- **Confidence levels:** Justified, given the detailed static analysis and the absence of suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0.0** — no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — no obfuscation detected; code is complex but transparent.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.0** — negligible security risk; purely static analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** All reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and consistent with the code's purpose and structure. No adjustments are necessary.",
