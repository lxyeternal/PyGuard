  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the influxdb library, reading version info, dependencies, and metadata from static files.",
  "sources": "Version info from __init__.py, dependencies from requirements.txt and test-requirements.txt, README.rst for description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external inputs affecting security; static file reads with no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Static file reads during setup, no dynamic or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad try-except blocks for optional imports, which is common but could mask import errors; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script performing static configuration tasks. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external network activity is present. The broad exception handling is standard for compatibility but does not introduce security risks. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are found. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero.",
