  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Reads version from `__init__.py`, dependencies, test dependencies, and README.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data, no dynamic code, no suspicious constructs.\n- **Analysis:** Standard setup script, with broad exception handling common in such scripts but not suspicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, typical package setup.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, reads version and dependencies.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no dynamic execution, no secrets.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward, standard setup logic.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—reads version, dependencies, description.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted input, no dynamic code, no secrets.\n- **Analysis:** Typical setup script, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard package configuration.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—reads version, dependencies, description.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Standard setup process.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks or malicious intent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same, reads version, dependencies, description.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data flows, no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Typical setup script, safe and straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports consistently identify that the code performs standard setup tasks.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- No external or untrusted inputs are processed during setup.\n- Exception handling is broad but typical for such scripts.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or network activity observed.\n\n### Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is static and benign. **Set to 0.0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward. **Set to 0.0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the above, the overall security risk is minimal. The only consideration might be the broad exception handling, but this is common and not inherently risky in setup scripts. **Set to 0.0 or 0.1** if a conservative approach is preferred.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Overall, this is a benign, standard package setup script with no security concerns.**",
