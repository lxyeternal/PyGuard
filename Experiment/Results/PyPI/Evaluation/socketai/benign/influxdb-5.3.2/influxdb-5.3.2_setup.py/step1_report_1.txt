  "purpose": "Define setup options for the 'influxdb' Python package, including reading version info, dependencies, and package metadata.",
  "sources": [
    "Reading '__init__.py' for version string",
    "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies",
    "Reading 'test-requirements.txt' for test dependencies",
    "Reading 'README.rst' for long description"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "None identified—no untrusted data directly used in sensitive operations or external commands"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Version info is extracted from package __init__.py and used in setup()",
    "Dependencies are read from text files and assigned to parameters",
    "Metadata is set without external input"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of broad exception handling during import of distribute_setup and setuptools, which is common in setup scripts but not suspicious",
    "No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present",
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed",
    "No network activity, file modifications, or external command execution"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python package. It attempts to import optional modules with fallback options, reads static files for version and dependencies, and calls setup() with package metadata. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The exception handling is broad but typical for compatibility in setup scripts. No suspicious or obfuscated code features are present. Overall, this appears to be a normal, benign package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads static data and configures package installation without external input or dangerous operations.",
