  "purpose": "Utility functions for formatting data points into InfluxDB line protocol, including timestamp conversion, escaping, and line assembly.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as measurement, tags, fields, and time; internal functions processing these inputs.",
  "sinks": "Generated line protocol string; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through escaping and conversion functions into formatted line strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data formatting tasks with proper handling of timestamps, escaping special characters, and assembling measurement lines. It uses well-established libraries for date parsing and timezone management. No external calls, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The functions are straightforward, purpose-specific, and do not contain malicious logic. Potential security concern exists if untrusted data is sent directly to a database without validation, but the code itself properly escapes special characters, mitigating injection risks. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for formatting data into InfluxDB line protocol. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities. The slight security risk score reflects the importance of validating input before downstream use, not a flaw in the code itself.",
