  "purpose": "Initialize the influxdb package by importing necessary modules and exposing key classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for future features and internal modules (.client, .dataframe_client, .helper).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; primarily static imports and module setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists of standard package initialization without suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, then imports specific classes from internal modules to set up the package API. It defines __all__ for exports and sets a version string. There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling, no network operations, and no suspicious logic. The code appears to be straightforward package setup code with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard package initialization script with no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks identified. It simply prepares the module for use.",
