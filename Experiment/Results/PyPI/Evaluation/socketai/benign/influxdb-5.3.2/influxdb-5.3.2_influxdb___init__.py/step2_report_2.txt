  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a typical `__init__.py` for a Python package.\n   - It imports future statements for compatibility across Python versions.\n   - It imports specific classes from internal modules (`client`, `dataframe_client`, `helper`).\n   - It defines `__all__` to specify public API.\n   - It sets a `__version__` string.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Report Summaries:**\n   - All five reports agree that this is standard package initialization code.\n   - They consistently state there are no suspicious patterns, no malicious behavior, and no security risks.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), and all reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or data flows are identified.\n   - The purpose, sources, sinks, and flows are all straightforward.\n\n3. **Evaluation of the Reports:**\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely boilerplate for package setup.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues is found.\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - Since the code is standard, there's no reason to assign any risk higher than zero.\n   - The malware score is correctly zero; there's no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score is correctly zero; no obfuscation detected.\n   - The overall risk score should remain at 0, consistent with the reports.\n\n5. **Final Justification:**\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or risky.\n   - The reports are accurate in their assessment.\n   - No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\nThis code is a standard, benign package initializer with no security concerns.",
