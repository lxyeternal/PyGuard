  "purpose": "Initialize the influxdb Python package by importing core classes and defining module exports and version.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: client, dataframe_client, helper",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; no network or external system interactions",
  "flows": "Module import flow; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard package initialization code with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py for a Python package, importing future compatibility features, internal modules, and defining __all__ and __version__. It contains no external inputs, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or security-sensitive operations. All reports confirm its benign nature, assigning malware and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's purpose is purely to set up package exports, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The assessments are consistent and justified.",
