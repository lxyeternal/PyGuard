  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward package initializer with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n   - The code only imports future features and local modules, defines `__all__`, and sets a version string.\n   - No external data sources, sinks, or malicious patterns are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is standard boilerplate with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are zero for malware and security risk, there's no need to justify higher scores.\n   - The code is benign.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on observable code structure.\n   - The assessments are sound.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall System Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n### Final Justified Assessment:\nThis code is a standard package initialization script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and security risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
