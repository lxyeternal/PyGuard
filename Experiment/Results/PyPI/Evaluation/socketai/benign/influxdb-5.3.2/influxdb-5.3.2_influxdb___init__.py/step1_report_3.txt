  "purpose": "Initialize the influxdb package by importing necessary components and setting up exports.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; only module imports and variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely performs module setup tasks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward and standard for package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, then imports specific classes from local modules, and defines __all__ and __version__ variables. It appears to be a standard package __init__.py file with no logic, data handling, or external communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs. It strictly serves as a package initializer.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a package initializer with no malicious or security risks detected. It performs standard module imports and setup without any suspicious elements.",
