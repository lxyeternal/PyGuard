  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Anomalies:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is straightforward package initialization, importing only internal modules and defining exports.\n   - No external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code is standard boilerplate for a Python package's `__init__.py`.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n   - The code's purpose and behavior are consistent and correct.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Justification:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n   - The reports are consistent among themselves.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - Since no malicious activity, external inputs, or suspicious code are present, the malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The obfuscated score is also correctly 0, given the code's clarity.\n   - The security risk score is appropriately 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a standard, benign package initializer with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The existing scores are accurate and justified based on the provided analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary; the current report assessments are appropriate.",
