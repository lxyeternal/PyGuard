  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward package initializer (`__init__.py`) for the influxdb Python package.\n- They emphasize that the code only imports future compatibility features, local modules, and sets up `__all__` and `__version__`.\n- No external data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware and security risk scores at 0, which seems appropriate given the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any data input, output, or processing beyond module setup.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- The code is standard boilerplate for a Python package's `__init__.py`.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Malware score: 0 across all reports is justified.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is justified; no obfuscation detected.\n- Security risk: 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that the code is only for package setup, which appears accurate.\n- No indication of malicious intent or vulnerabilities based on the provided code snippet.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned in all reports seem reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, benign package initializer with no security concerns. The scores reflect that accurately.",
