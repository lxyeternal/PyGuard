  "purpose": "This code initializes the influxdb Python package by importing modules and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ for compatibility; relative imports of client, dataframe_client, helper modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or inputs; no code execution or data handling occurs here.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports and version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains standard package initialization and import statements without any suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports future compatibility features, imports core classes, and defines the module's public interface and version. It does not process external inputs, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. There are no hardcoded credentials, no code injection, and no suspicious behaviors detected. The code strictly performs package setup tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply prepares the package for use by importing necessary modules and defining exports.",
