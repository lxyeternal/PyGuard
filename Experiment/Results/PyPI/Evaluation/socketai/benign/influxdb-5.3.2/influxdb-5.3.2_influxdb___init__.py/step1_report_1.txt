  "purpose": "Initialize the influxdb package by importing necessary modules and defining public API exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ and local module files (.client, .dataframe_client, .helper). No external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward package initialization code with no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future statements to ensure compatibility, then imports specific classes from local modules, and defines the __all__ list for public API. The __version__ string is set, indicating package version. There are no data inputs, network operations, or security-sensitive operations present. The code appears to be a standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple package initializer for the influxdb module. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code patterns, and no security risks. It is standard boilerplate code for setting up a Python package.",
