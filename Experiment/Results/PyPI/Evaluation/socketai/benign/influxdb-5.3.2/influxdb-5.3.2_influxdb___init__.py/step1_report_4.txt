  "purpose": "Initialize and expose the components of the influxdb Python package for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__ and local modules (.client, .dataframe_client, .helper).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external communication; code primarily defines imports and exports.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only sets up module structure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. The __future__ imports are standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization script. It imports future features for compatibility across Python versions, then imports specific classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__. No data input, no external network interactions, and no dynamic code execution are present. The __version__ is a simple string indicating package version. No suspicious or malicious code elements are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer for the influxdb Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up package exports.",
