  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured helper class for data batching and insertion into InfluxDB. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1 (mainly due to reliance on external client, which is standard). Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
