{
  "purpose": "The code provides a wrapper class for processing InfluxDB query results, enabling data access and filtering.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'series' object passed during initialization, specifically from its 'error', 'series', 'columns', and 'values' keys.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur if untrusted data from the series is used insecurely; however, the code only processes and yields data without external effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the raw series input into internal properties, then through methods like get_points and __getitem__ for filtering, ultimately yielding point dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses warnings.warn for deprecation notices; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No dynamic code execution or external network calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes with a series object containing InfluxDB results and processes this data through properties and methods to filter and retrieve points based on measurement names and tags. It performs type checks on inputs, warns about deprecated usage, and yields data accordingly. No suspicious code paths, network operations, or credential handling are present. It relies solely on data provided during instantiation, with no apparent malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard data wrapper for InfluxDB query results with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It simply processes and filters data from provided input. No malware or security risks are detected.",
