{
  "purpose": "A wrapper class for handling InfluxDB query results, providing methods to access series data, filter points, and manage internal data structures.",
  "sources": "Reads from the 'series' key in the input dictionary, accessing 'error', 'measurement', 'tags', 'values', and 'columns' within each series.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; data is processed and yielded internally as generators.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the raw input through internal methods like _get_series, get_points, and __getitem__, filtering based on measurement and tags, then yielding points.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code; use of warnings for deprecation is benign; no obfuscation or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data wrapper for InfluxDB query results, with methods to access series, filter points by measurement and tags, and generate data dictionaries. It does not perform any network operations, code injection, or handle sensitive data insecurely. The deprecation warning for __getitem__ is standard and not malicious. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely data handling, with no external side effects or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for processing InfluxDB results. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this benign nature.",
