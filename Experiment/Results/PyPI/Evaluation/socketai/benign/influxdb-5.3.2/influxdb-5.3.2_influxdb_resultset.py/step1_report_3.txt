{
  "purpose": "This module provides a wrapper around InfluxDB query results, allowing for data extraction, filtering, and representation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'series' input during initialization, specifically from its 'error', 'series', 'columns', 'values', 'measurement', and 'tags' attributes.",
  "sinks": "Data flows primarily within generator functions and property methods, with no external sinks like network or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the raw input 'series' through internal methods (_get_series, _get_points_for_series, point_from_cols_vals), with filtering based on tags and measurement name, ultimately yielding dictionaries representing points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of warnings for deprecation is standard. No unsafe dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. The code primarily manipulates data structures and does not perform any network or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a data wrapper for InfluxDB query results, providing filtering and representation functionalities. It includes proper type checks and uses generator functions to handle potentially large data efficiently. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, network connections, or code injection. The use of warnings for deprecated methods is routine. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data handling utility for InfluxDB results with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and lacks suspicious or harmful features.",
