  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications, scores, and potential issues.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code handles optional dependency on pandas gracefully.\n- No data leaks, network calls, or untrusted data processing are present.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities.\n- The only minor concern is the deletion of the pandas import after importing it, which is unconventional but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Review per Report**\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** Clear, no anomalies, straightforward handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — appropriate, no security risk.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, detailed reasoning confirms no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues, scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above, with detailed explanation.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** No security concerns; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), mentions standard dependency handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly lower but justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious or security issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Notes the deletion of pandas import as unusual but not malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — this is slightly elevated due to the unusual deletion, but it does not indicate a security threat.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified given the unconventional pattern but no malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The slight increase in security risk score (0.1) is acceptable given the unconventional import deletion, but it does not imply a security vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code being benign.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All zero or near-zero, appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Potential concerns:** The only minor point is the deletion of pandas after import, which is unconventional but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed; the code is a standard optional dependency handler with no malicious or security issues.\n- The slight security risk score of 0.1 in Report 5 is justified due to the unconventional deletion of the pandas import but does not indicate a security vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### **My Personal Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering the import deletion as a minor unconventional pattern, but still not risky)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious behavior. The scores in the reports are appropriate, and no further action is required.",
