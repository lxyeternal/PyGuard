  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages optional pandas dependency, defining a fallback class that raises ImportError if pandas is missing. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious logic.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward dependency handling. No signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed explanation. The code attempts to import pandas, defines a fallback class that raises ImportError if pandas isn't available, otherwise imports a specific DataFrameClient implementation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard optional dependency management. The code raises ImportError if pandas is missing, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0\n\n- **Assessment:** No security concerns. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar pattern, with a fallback class raising ImportError. Slightly lower confidence (0.9). No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0\n\n- **Assessment:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The only notable point is the deletion of the pandas import after importing it, which is unconventional but not malicious. The code still raises ImportError if pandas is missing.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, SecurityRisk = 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The deletion of the import is unusual but not harmful. It doesn't introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The risk score of 0.1 might be slightly elevated due to the unconventional import handling, but overall, it remains low.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—dependency management and fallback—these are inherently low risk. The only minor point is in report 5, where the import deletion is unconventional but not risky.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n- No adjustments needed unless future analysis uncovers hidden malicious payloads, which is unlikely here.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very low; only minor unconventional handling, no security issues)\n\nThe code is standard dependency handling with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.",
