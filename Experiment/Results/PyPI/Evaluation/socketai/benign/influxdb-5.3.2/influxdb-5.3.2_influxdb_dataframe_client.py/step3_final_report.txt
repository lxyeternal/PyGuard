  "purpose": "Handle optional dependency on pandas for DataFrame client functionality, providing a fallback that raises ImportError if pandas is missing.",
  "sources": "Import statement for pandas; deletion of pandas import after successful import.",
  "sinks": "Raising ImportError upon instantiation of fallback class; no data leaks or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import pandas; if successful, import DataFrameClient; if not, fallback class raises ImportError.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional deletion of pandas import after import, but not malicious or risky.",
  "analysis": "The code manages optional pandas dependency with a try-except block. If pandas is available, it imports a specific DataFrameClient; otherwise, it defines a fallback class that raises ImportError when instantiated. The deletion of pandas after import is unusual but not harmful. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or backdoors. The fallback pattern is standard for optional dependencies. The deletion of pandas import does not introduce security issues but is unconventional. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and contains no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for optional dependency handling with no malicious or security concerns. The only minor anomaly is the deletion of pandas after import, which is harmless. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.0 to 0.1). The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for use.",
