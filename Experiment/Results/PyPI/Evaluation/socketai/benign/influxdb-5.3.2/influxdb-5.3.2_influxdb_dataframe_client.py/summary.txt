  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for optional dependency handling with no malicious or security concerns. The only minor anomaly is the deletion of pandas after import, which is harmless. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.0 to 0.1). The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for use."
