  "purpose": "Define a DataFrame client for InfluxDB that depends on Pandas if available; fallback to another implementation if Pandas is not installed.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pandas, and the conditional import of DataFrameClient from another module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import pandas, then define or import DataFrameClient based on availability.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code behaves as expected for optional dependency handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles optional dependency import for pandas. If pandas is available, it imports a specific DataFrameClient implementation; if not, it defines a fallback class that raises ImportError when instantiated. No data flows, user input, or untrusted data sources are involved. No suspicious or malicious code segments are detected; the code is straightforward and standard for optional dependency management.",
  "conclusion": "This code manages optional pandas dependency gracefully, providing a fallback that raises an informative error if pandas is missing. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
