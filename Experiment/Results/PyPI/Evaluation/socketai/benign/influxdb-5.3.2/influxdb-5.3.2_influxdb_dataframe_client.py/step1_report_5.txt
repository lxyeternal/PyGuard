  "purpose": "To provide a DataFrame client interface for InfluxDB, utilizing pandas if available.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially the import of pandas and the import of the module's own DataFrameClient or fallback to InfluxDBClient.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks in this code; no untrusted data processing or network operations are performed.",
  "flows": "The code attempts to import pandas; if unavailable, it raises an ImportError during class instantiation. No data flow from external sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code deletes the pandas import after importing it, which is unusual but not malicious. The class 'DataFrameClient' is conditionally defined based on pandas import success. No secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily responsible for setting up a class depending on the availability of pandas. It handles ImportError gracefully by defining a fallback class that raises an exception if pandas is not installed. The pattern is standard for optional dependencies. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The deletion of the pandas import is somewhat unconventional but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This module is designed to conditionally provide a DataFrame client based on pandas availability. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It correctly handles missing dependencies and does not perform any network operations or data leaks.",
