  "purpose": "This code provides a client class for handling DataFrame operations with InfluxDB, with conditional fallback if pandas is not available.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pandas and internal module imports, especially the import of pandas which may be optional.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted data, but the code raises an ImportError if pandas is missing, which could affect application flow.",
  "flows": "The flow involves attempting to import pandas; if successful, it imports a DataFrameClient; if not, it defines a fallback class that raises an ImportError during initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. The code includes standard fallback handling for missing dependencies, and no hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with importing future features for compatibility. It then attempts to import pandas, deleting the import after to avoid namespace pollution. If pandas is not available, it defines a fallback class that inherits from InfluxDBClient and raises an ImportError during instantiation, indicating pandas is required. If pandas is present, it imports a different DataFrameClient implementation. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues; the code is straightforward dependency management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard dependency management with fallback handling for missing pandas. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. It simply enforces pandas presence for DataFrame functionality.",
