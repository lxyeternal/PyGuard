{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to define a DataFrame client for InfluxDB, which utilizes pandas if available, or falls back to an alternative implementation if pandas is not installed.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import of pandas and the instantiation of DataFrameClient, as well as the import statements for local modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data. No network, file, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves attempting to import pandas, and depending on success or failure, either importing a specialized DataFrameClient or raising an ImportError.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are detected. The code straightforwardly handles optional dependency import and raises an error if pandas is missing. No suspicious or unusual code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with compatibility imports for Python 2 and 3. It then defines an exported class name. The try block attempts to import pandas, deleting it immediately after import to avoid namespace pollution. If pandas is not available, it catches ImportError and defines a DataFrameClient class that inherits from InfluxDBClient, raising an ImportError upon instantiation to indicate pandas is required. If pandas is successfully imported, it imports a specific DataFrameClient implementation. The code handles optional dependency import gracefully and does not include any network or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard dependency management and class setup for a pandas-dependent client. There are no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity.",
