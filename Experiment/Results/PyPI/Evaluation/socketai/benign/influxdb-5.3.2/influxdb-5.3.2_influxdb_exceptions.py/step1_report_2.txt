  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to InfluxDB client operations.",
  "sources": "Input data provided to exception classes via 'content' and 'code' parameters during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Exception message construction and raising, which could potentially leak untrusted data if 'content' contains sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Input data (content, code) -> Exception class constructors -> message formatting -> raising exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code performs standard exception handling with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with constructors that process input parameters. It decodes 'content' if it's a byte string and constructs error messages accordingly. There are no external data sources, network operations, or suspicious code flows. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is present. The handling appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in an InfluxDB client context. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
