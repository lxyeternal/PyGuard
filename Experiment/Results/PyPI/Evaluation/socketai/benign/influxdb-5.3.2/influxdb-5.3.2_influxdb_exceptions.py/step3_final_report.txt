  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in InfluxDB client operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'content' and 'code' provided during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Error message construction using 'content' and 'code'; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input 'content' is checked for byte type, decoded if necessary, then used to form exception messages.",
  "anomalies": "The check 'isinstance(content, type(b''))' is slightly unconventional; otherwise, no anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two standard exception classes with straightforward logic. It decodes byte content before message formatting, a common pattern. No external data sources, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. Minor stylistic note: using 'isinstance(content, bytes)' could be clearer, but it does not impact security or functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions for an InfluxDB client. No malicious or security risks are present. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
