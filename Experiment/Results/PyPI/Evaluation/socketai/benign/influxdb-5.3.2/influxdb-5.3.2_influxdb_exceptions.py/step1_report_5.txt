{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to InfluxDB client operations.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; data is passed via exception instantiation arguments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; exceptions are used for error signaling only.",
  "flows": "Error content passed to exception constructors; no external data flows or processing beyond message formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with constructors that format error messages. The only potential concern is the check 'isinstance(content, type(b''))', which is intended to verify if 'content' is bytes before decoding. This is a standard pattern for handling different input types. The rest of the code is typical for exception classes, with no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of custom exception classes for InfluxDB client errors. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks present in this code snippet.",
