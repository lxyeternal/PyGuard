  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines two custom exception classes: `InfluxDBClientError` and `InfluxDBServerError`.\n- Both classes process input parameters (`content`, and `code` for the first) to generate error messages.\n- Content decoding occurs if `content` is of byte type.\n- No external data sources, network operations, or obfuscated/malicious code are present.\n- The code appears to be standard exception handling for an InfluxDB client.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All describe the code as standard, straightforward exception classes.\n- No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code: it's typical error handling logic.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the analysis.\n\n### Scores and Justifications\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and readable.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, which is justified—no security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are evident.\n\n### Potential Issues or Discrepancies\n\n- The only minor point is the check `isinstance(content, type(b''))`. While this is a common pattern, it could be more explicitly written as `isinstance(content, bytes)`. However, this is not a security concern, just a style note.\n- No report suggests any external input that could lead to code injection or data leakage.\n\n### Final Assessment\n\nGiven the thorough review, the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical exception class implementation with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or security risks. The scoring aligns with the code's nature. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
