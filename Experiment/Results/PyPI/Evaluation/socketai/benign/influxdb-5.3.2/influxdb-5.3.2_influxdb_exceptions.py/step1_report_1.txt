  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in InfluxDB client operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'content' and 'code' in the exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "Exception message construction and storage in 'self.message' and 'self.content'.",
  "flows": "Input 'content' and 'code' flow into exception initialization, affecting error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard exception handling with content decoding.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes inheriting from Exception, with constructors that process input parameters. Content decoding occurs if 'content' is of byte type, and messages are formatted accordingly. There are no external inputs, network operations, or unsafe code practices. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard error handling classes for an InfluxDB client, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
