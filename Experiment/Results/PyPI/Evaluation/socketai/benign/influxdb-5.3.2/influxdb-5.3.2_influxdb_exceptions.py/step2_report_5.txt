  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports agree that the code is straightforward, defining two custom exception classes with standard error handling logic. There are no external data sources, network operations, or suspicious code patterns. The only noteworthy operation is the decoding of 'content' if it's bytes, which is a common practice.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**  \nThe reports correctly identify that the code is standard and safe. No logical errors or security flaws are evident. The only minor point is the check `isinstance(content, type(b''))`, which is valid for verifying if 'content' is bytes before decoding.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature. The security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate. The confidence levels are high (1), reflecting the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is purely defining exception classes with no external interactions, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious behavior, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The code does not perform any dangerous operations.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct. There is no indication of malicious payloads, code injection, or obfuscated behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nThe reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as standard error handling classes.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report Content**  \nScores are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Notes:\nThe code is a typical implementation of custom exception classes for an InfluxDB client. It performs minimal processing, primarily decoding bytes and formatting messages, which is safe and standard practice.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided code and reports collectively indicate a safe, non-malicious, and non-obfuscated implementation with no security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the code's straightforward and benign nature.",
