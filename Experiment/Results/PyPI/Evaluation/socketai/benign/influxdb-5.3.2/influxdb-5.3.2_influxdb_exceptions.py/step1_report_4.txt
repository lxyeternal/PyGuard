{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling InfluxDB client and server errors.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'content' and 'code' to the exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling that leads to effects like system modification or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input data ('content', 'code') flows into exception messages but does not reach external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception. It processes input 'content' by decoding bytes if needed, then constructs error messages. No external data transmission, code execution, or obfuscated logic is present. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is standard for exception handling and does not involve unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for InfluxDB errors. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. It appears to be a benign, purpose-specific module.",
