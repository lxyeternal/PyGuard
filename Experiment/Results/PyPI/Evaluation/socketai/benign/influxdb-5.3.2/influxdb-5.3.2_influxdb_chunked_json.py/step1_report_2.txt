  "purpose": "To generate a sequence of JSON objects from a string input by decoding JSON data iteratively.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 's' which contains the JSON string to be decoded.",
  "sinks": "The JSONDecoder's raw_decode method which processes the input string and produces JSON objects.",
  "flows": "Input string 's' is read and stripped; then passed to raw_decode; decoded object is yielded; remaining string is processed again.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs straightforward JSON parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'loads' that takes a string 's', creates a JSONDecoder, and iteratively decodes JSON objects from the string. It strips whitespace, decodes the first JSON object, yields it, then slices the string to process the remaining data. No external inputs, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The logic appears to be a simple custom JSON streaming parser. No obfuscation, malicious code, or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign JSON streaming parser with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It processes JSON strings efficiently and transparently without dangerous side effects.",
