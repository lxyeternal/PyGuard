{
  "purpose": "To generate a sequence of JSON objects from a string input by decoding chunked JSON data.",
  "sources": "The input string parameter 's' in the 'loads' function, which is read for JSON data.",
  "sinks": "The 'json.JSONDecoder().raw_decode' method which processes the input string, potentially leading to data processing or execution if misused.",
  "flows": "Input string 's' is stripped, decoded via 'raw_decode', and yielded as JSON objects; then the remaining string is processed in subsequent iterations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors; the code is straightforward and standard for JSON processing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to parse multiple JSON objects from a single string. It uses standard Python 'json' library methods without obfuscation. The input is cleaned and parsed iteratively. No external data sources or sinks are present; the decoding process is safe. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard JSON chunk parser with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is used to sequentially decode JSON objects from a string input safely.",
