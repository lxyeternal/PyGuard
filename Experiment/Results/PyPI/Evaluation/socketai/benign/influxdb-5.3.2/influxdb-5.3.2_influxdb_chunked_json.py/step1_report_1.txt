{
  "purpose": "To generate a sequence of JSON objects from a string input by incrementally decoding JSON data.",
  "sources": "The input string parameter 's' is read at the start of the 'loads' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'json.JSONDecoder().raw_decode()' method processes the input string; however, it does not execute untrusted code or write to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input string 's' is decoded iteratively, with each decoded object advancing the position in the string until complete or error.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code uses standard JSON decoding methods without obfuscation or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a generator function that yields JSON objects parsed from a string. It strips whitespace, decodes one JSON object at a time, and updates the remaining string for subsequent decoding. The use of standard library functions and straightforward control flow suggests no malicious intent or security risks. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple JSON parsing utility that processes a string into multiple JSON objects sequentially. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Its design is typical and safe for intended use.",
