  "purpose": "A generator function that parses multiple JSON objects from a string input using Python's standard json.JSONDecoder().raw_decode().",
  "sources": "Reads input string 's', processes it with json.JSONDecoder().raw_decode() to decode JSON objects.",
  "sinks": "None; no external or untrusted data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input string 's' flows into raw_decode(), producing decoded objects and remaining string slices.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward implementation with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard utility for parsing multiple JSON objects from a string. It strips whitespace, decodes one JSON object at a time, yields it, and slices the string for further decoding. Uses only standard library functions with no side effects or malicious behavior. No obfuscation or external dependencies are present. The code is safe and intended for chunked JSON processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward JSON parser utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It correctly scores malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is slightly conservative but acceptable; it could be lowered to 0 for consistency. Overall, the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
