  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward JSON parser utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It correctly scores malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is slightly conservative but acceptable; it could be lowered to 0 for consistency. Overall, the reports are accurate and appropriate."
