{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility function to parse a string containing multiple JSON objects and generate them as a sequence.",
  "sources": "The input string 's' provided to the loads() function.",
  "fires": "The json.JSONDecoder().raw_decode() method which processes the JSON string and extracts JSON objects.",
  "flows": "Input string 's' -> raw_decode() to parse JSON objects -> yielded as sequence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard JSON parsing methods without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a generator that parses multiple JSON objects from a string, stripping whitespace and using the built-in json.JSONDecoder().raw_decode(). There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. No external data is fetched, and no code executes untrusted input beyond parsing. The code appears well-structured and legitimate for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe utility for parsing multiple JSON objects from a string. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
