  "purpose": "Framework bootstrap, version check, environment setup, and module imports for the angr project.",
  "sources": "Environment check via 'if bytes is str:', module imports, setup_terminal() call.",
  "sinks": "No external untrusted data processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No external data flows; import statements and environment checks are static.",
  "anomalies": "The 'if bytes is str:' check raises a long exception message about upgrading to Python 3, which is unusual but benign—serves as a user notification.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard initialization tasks for a large Python package. The version check is a benign user-facing message, not malicious. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The exception message is a friendly prompt for users to upgrade Python, not an attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe setup script for the angr framework. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The exception message about Python 3 migration is benign and intended as a user notification.",
