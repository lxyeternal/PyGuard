{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to build, clean, and develop a native library component (angr_native) as part of a Python package setup process, including platform-specific build steps.",
  "sources": "Import statements, environment variable setup, subprocess calls for make/nmake, glob for cleaning files, and package resource access.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run (build commands), shutil.copy (copying native libraries), glob.glob (file deletion), importlib.resources.files (resource access).",
  "flows": "Environment variables set from package resources → build commands executed via subprocess → native library files copied to project directory → cleaning removes specific native build files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Use of subprocess to run system build tools (make, nmake) is standard for native extensions. Resource access is standard. No obfuscated or misleading code. No data leaks or suspicious data flows observed.",
  "analysis": "The code manages native build processes for platform-specific shared libraries, uses importlib to access package resources, and executes system build tools conditionally. No malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are evident. The subprocess commands are for build automation, typical in native extension compilation. The resource file paths are constructed using package resource APIs, which are standard. No hardcoded credentials, hidden backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The code appears to perform legitimate build and cleanup tasks for a Python package with native components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for building native extensions with platform-specific handling. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indicators. No security risks are detected based on this analysis.",
