  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe a build/setup script for native extensions, involving platform-specific commands, resource management, and cleanup routines.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration is present.\n- The subprocess calls are controlled and typical for build scripts.\n- Environment variables are set based on package resources, not user input.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected.\n- The code's primary purpose is to facilitate native library compilation and setup, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard build script for native extension.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** `importlib.import_module`, `subprocess.run()`, `shutil.copy()`, `shutil.rmtree()`.\n- **Flow:** Import resource paths → set environment variables → run build command → copy library.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of subprocess with dynamic commands; no input validation, but typical for build scripts.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The only concern is potential manipulation if environment variables are tampered with, but this is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 (low). This seems reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with similar reasoning.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, standard build process.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- Focuses on platform-specific build commands, environment setup, and cleanup.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious logic; subprocess commands are standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing resource access and build commands.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- Emphasizes native build process, platform-specific commands, cleanup.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, standard build script.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the potential risks of executing external commands, but within normal bounds for build scripts.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No adjustments needed; the assessments are reasonable.\n- The main concern is the reliance on subprocess execution, which could be exploited if environment variables or build files are manipulated, but this is typical and not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (standard build process risks, acceptable)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the code's nature well. No further action or concern is warranted based on this analysis.",
