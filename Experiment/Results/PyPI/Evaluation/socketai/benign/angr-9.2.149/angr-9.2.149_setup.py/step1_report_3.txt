  "purpose": "This script manages the build, clean, and development setup process for a Python project, specifically handling native library compilation and platform-specific setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements, environment variable setup, subprocess calls to build tools, file globbing for cleanup, and platform detection logic.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution of 'make', 'nmake', or 'gmake', file copying and deletion, environment variable modification, and platform-specific configuration commands.",
  "flows": "Environment variables set from imported resources -> subprocess run commands to build native code -> native libraries copied to project directory -> cleanup removes build artifacts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Use of subprocess with fixed commands; potential risk if commands are manipulated or if malicious environment variables are injected, but typical for build scripts. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code facilitates building native components using platform-specific make tools, with environment variables dynamically set from package resources. It performs cleanup of build artifacts and modifies build commands based on platform detection. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. The subprocess calls are standard for build processes. No signs of malware or covert operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build and setup script for native extensions, with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain attacks. It handles platform-specific compilation, cleanup, and development workflows securely, based on the provided logic.",
