{
  "purpose": "This code manages the build, clean, and development setup processes for a Python package involving native libraries, particularly building and copying platform-specific shared libraries for the 'angr_native' component.",
  "sources": "Import statements, environment variable setup, subprocess calls for building native code, file globbing for cleanup, and platform-specific conditions.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution via subprocess.run, file system modifications (os.unlink, shutil.copy, os.mkdir), environment variable manipulations, and dynamic platform-specific argument appending.",
  "flows": "Environment variable setup (source) -> subprocess.run to build native code (sink) -> copying built libraries (sink) -> cleanup native files (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.run with dynamically determined commands; environment variables referencing package resources; platform-dependent build commands; no explicit use of untrusted input sources; no hardcoded credentials or sensitive data; code appears focused on build management.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles native library build processes with platform-specific commands and environment variables. It uses importlib to resolve resource paths and subprocess to invoke system build tools. No signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The subprocess commands are used for building native components, which is typical for such setup scripts. The cleanup function deletes build artifacts based on file patterns, and the build and develop commands coordinate build steps. There are no anomalies indicative of malicious intent, and the code functions within standard package setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard build and setup management code for a Python package with native dependencies. No malicious behavior or sabotage indicators are detected. It responsibly manages native library compilation across platforms without suspicious activities.",
