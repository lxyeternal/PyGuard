  "purpose": "This script manages the build, cleaning, and development setup for a Python package with native code components, handling platform-specific build commands and resource management.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module, importlib.resources.files, glob.glob, os.environ, subprocess.run, shutil.copy, shutil.rmtree, os.unlink, os.mkdir",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run (build commands), shutil.copy (library files), os.unlink (cleanup), os.mkdir (directory creation)",
  "flows": "Resource path retrieval via importlib.resources → environment variable setup → subprocess execution of build commands → copying built libraries → cleanup of build artifacts",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with dynamically constructed commands based on platform detection; no input validation or user-controlled data involved; resource paths derived from package data, not external input",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard build setup script for native extensions, with platform-specific handling for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It sets environment variables pointing to package resources, executes system build tools, and manages build artifacts. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data exfiltration are present. The subprocess calls are typical for such build scripts, and resource access is controlled. The risk associated with subprocess execution is minimal and inherent to build processes. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious data flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build setup script for native extensions, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting typical build process risks. Overall, the script is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
