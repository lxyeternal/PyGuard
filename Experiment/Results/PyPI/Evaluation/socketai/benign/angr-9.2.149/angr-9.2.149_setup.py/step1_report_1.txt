  "purpose": "This script is designed to build, clean, and develop a native extension for a Python package, specifically handling platform-specific compilation and setup tasks.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module('pyvex'), subprocess.run(), shutil.which(), importlib.resources.files()",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run(), shutil.copy(), shutil.rmtree(), os.unlink()",
  "flows": "importlib.import_module('pyvex') -> environment variable setup -> subprocess.run for building native code -> shutil.copy for copying libraries",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.run with dynamically constructed commands; platform-specific handling; no clear validation of external inputs or environment variables; no obfuscated code, but reliance on external build tools and environment could be exploited if manipulated",
  "analysis": "The code performs platform-dependent operations to compile native code, involving environment variable setup and subprocess execution. It retrieves resource paths for build dependencies and executes build commands. It also manages cleanup of native build artifacts. There are no signs of malicious logic such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network communication. However, the use of subprocess with dynamically constructed commands without input validation could pose security concerns if the environment or inputs are manipulated. The code's primary function is to facilitate native library compilation and setup, which is typical for such build scripts. No malware or malicious behavior is evident, and there are no suspicious data flows or code obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build setup script for native extensions with platform-specific handling. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or malware signs. The only minor concern is the reliance on subprocess execution which, if exploited via environment or file system manipulation, could pose security risks, but within typical usage, it is safe.",
