  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the script is a build/setup script for native extensions, with platform-specific handling.\n- No report indicates any malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The code relies on subprocess calls to system build tools (make, nmake, gmake), which is standard for such scripts.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data flows are identified.\n- The primary concern is the potential risk from executing external commands with environment variables and resource paths, but these are controlled and typical for build scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues and Logic:\n\n- **Presence of code:** The code is present and functions as a build script.\n- **Malware:** No signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risks:** Low, mainly related to execution of external build commands, but within normal expectations.\n\n### Score Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the controlled environment and typical build process, a low risk score (~0.1-0.2) is appropriate. The reports assign 0.1-0.2, which seems reasonable.\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The reports do not identify any code that performs malicious actions.\n- The subprocess commands are predictable and necessary for building native code.\n- No suspicious data flows or hidden behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nBased on the reports and code review, **the scores assigned are appropriate**:\n\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: ~0.1-0.2\n\nThese reflect a standard build script with minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (standard build process, minor concern over subprocess execution, but controlled)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, well-structured, and typical for its purpose. No modifications to the scores are necessary based on this review.",
