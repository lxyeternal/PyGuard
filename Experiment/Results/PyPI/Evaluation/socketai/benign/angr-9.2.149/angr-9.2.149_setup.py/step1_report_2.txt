  "purpose": "This script automates building, cleaning, and developing a native library component for a Python package, including platform-specific handling.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, importlib.resources for resource paths, subprocess.run for executing build commands, glob for file deletion.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run (executes external build tools), os.unlink (deletes files), shutil.copy (copies native library files).",
  "flows": "Environment setup and resource path determination → subprocess execution for build → file cleanup and copying.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.run with dynamic command lists; platform-specific resource handling; no user input handling or untrusted data flow detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages build processes for native components with platform-specific logic. It sets environment variables based on package resources, executes system commands to build native libraries, and cleans up build artifacts. The subprocess calls are controlled, using predefined commands. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms is present. The code does not handle or process untrusted input, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The only concern could be the execution of external build tools, but this is standard for build scripts and appears to be safe and controlled.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a build and cleanup script for native extensions, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It follows standard build procedures and platform-specific handling without any suspicious patterns.",
