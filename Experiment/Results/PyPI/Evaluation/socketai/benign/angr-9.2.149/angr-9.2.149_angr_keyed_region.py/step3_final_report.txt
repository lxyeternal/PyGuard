  "purpose": "Memory region management system for handling objects and overlaps within a defined address space, likely used in static analysis or reverse engineering tools.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (start addresses, objects, sizes), internal data structures (_storage, _object_mapping, stored_objects, internal_objects).",
  "sinks": "Internal methods modifying data structures, no external system or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into stored objects, which are then managed within sorted mappings and sets, with internal references and weak references linking objects.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import of '_canonicalize_size' is unusual but not malicious; no secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages memory regions through classes representing objects and regions, with methods for adding, setting, merging, and replacing objects. It handles overlaps by splitting regions and updating internal structures. No external system calls, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and focused on internal data management. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident. The dynamic import of '_canonicalize_size' is mildly unusual but benign. The overall design aligns with legitimate static analysis or reverse engineering tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured memory region management module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is suitable for static analysis, reverse engineering, or symbolic memory modeling, with a very low security risk.",
