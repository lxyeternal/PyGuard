  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, its primary purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include environment variables, file reads, or user input functions if present.",
  "sinks": "Possible sinks include network connections, file writes, or data outputs that could leak information or cause unintended effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through various functions or data manipulations, if present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code shows standard Python practices without malicious indicators. There are no suspicious function calls, no code injecting or executing untrusted data, and no signs of data exfiltration or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate and consistent with common coding patterns. The code structure is straightforward, and no hardcoded secrets or unusual control flow is evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and does not exhibit signs of supply chain compromise or malware. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
