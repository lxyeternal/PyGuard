  "purpose": "Analysis of Python package source code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, dynamic code execution, network/file operations, potential obfuscation patterns.",
  "sinks": "Potential network connections, environment variable reads, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and dynamic code execution paths leading to potential network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (score 0.7), dynamic code features, minimal or no explicit malicious activity, suspicion of hidden intent.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and dynamic features, which are common indicators of malicious intent but are not definitive on their own. The obfuscation score is justified given the suspicion, and the malware score should be increased from 0.2 to approximately 0.4-0.5 to better reflect the potential risk. Other reports show minimal or no suspicious activity, with scores aligned to their benign assessments. The overall suspicion level is moderate due to obfuscation and dynamic code features, but no concrete malicious activity is confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "The source code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate suspicion. Adjusting the malware score to around 0.5 and the overall security risk to approximately 0.3 provides a more accurate reflection of the potential threat level. The code does not demonstrate definitive malicious behavior but warrants cautious review.",
