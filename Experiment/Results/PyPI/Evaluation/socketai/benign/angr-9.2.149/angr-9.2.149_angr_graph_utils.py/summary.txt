  "conclusion": "The source code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate suspicion. Adjusting the malware score to around 0.5 and the overall security risk to approximately 0.3 provides a more accurate reflection of the potential threat level. The code does not demonstrate definitive malicious behavior but warrants cautious review."
