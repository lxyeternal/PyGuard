  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured symbolic execution management framework with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The inherent risk is limited to the execution of user-supplied functions, which is a controlled and known aspect of such tools. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2)."
