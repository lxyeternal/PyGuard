{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for symbolic variables with protobuf serialization support, used in binary analysis or symbolic execution frameworks.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, protobuf deserialization methods, class attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "Serialization routines via protobuf messages, property accessors.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to class attributes, then to protobuf serialization/deserialization.",
  "anomalies": "Benign warning about stack variable offset range; no malicious patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code models various symbolic variables (register, memory, constant, temporary, stack) with standard serialization/deserialization routines. No network, file I/O, or code execution functions are present. Use of logging is benign. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident. The warning about stack offset exceeding range is a normal safety check. The code appears to be part of a symbolic execution or binary analysis framework, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of symbolic variable classes used in analysis tools. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior is present. The current malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
