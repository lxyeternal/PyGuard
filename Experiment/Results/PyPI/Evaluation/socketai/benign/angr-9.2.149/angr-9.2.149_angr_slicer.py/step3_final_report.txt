  "purpose": "A static analysis framework for binary IR code, implementing program slicing, alias analysis, and data flow tracking to assist reverse engineering or symbolic execution tasks.",
  "sources": "IR statements and expressions, architecture properties (e.g., register offsets, initial stack pointer).",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external I/O, network, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data propagates through internal state updates during forward and backward analysis, following source-to-sink paths within the code's logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static, internal data flow analysis with no external interactions. It handles IR constructs safely, with no signs of malicious payloads or obfuscation. The logic is straightforward, and the scores assigned in the reports are consistent with its benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis tool with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify its safe nature, except for a minor overestimation of security risk in one report. The overall malware score should be 0, obfuscation score 0, and security risk score 0.",
