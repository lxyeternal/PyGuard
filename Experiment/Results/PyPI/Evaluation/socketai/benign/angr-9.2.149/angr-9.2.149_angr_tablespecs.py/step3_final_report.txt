  "purpose": "Manage and serialize string and pointer data into symbolic memory for symbolic execution or binary analysis.",
  "sources": "Arguments, environment variables, pointers, and internal string data",
  "sinks": "Memory storage via state.memory.store during dump",
  "flows": "Input data (args, env, pointers) -> internal _contents -> dump() -> symbolic memory storage",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing strings and pointers, encoding them appropriately, and dumping into symbolic memory. It performs input validation, string encoding, and memory layout calculations correctly. No suspicious behaviors, external communications, or malicious logic are present. The code's purpose aligns with standard symbolic memory construction utilities, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility for symbolic string and pointer management, with no malicious or obfuscated features. All signals and scores are consistent, indicating a very low security risk.",
