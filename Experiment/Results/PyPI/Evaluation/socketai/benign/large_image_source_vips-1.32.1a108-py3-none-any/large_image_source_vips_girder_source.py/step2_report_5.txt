  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scoring justification.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines a class inheriting from two sources, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The code is straightforward.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score = 0 is appropriate. Security risk = 0 aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar benign class extension with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no data flow issues.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score = 0 is appropriate. Security risk is minimal.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly less than 1, but acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard class extension with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No network, data handling, or obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score = 0 is correct. Security risk is negligible.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—benign class definition.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score = 0 fits. Security risk is zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same benign class extension.\n- **Findings:** No issues.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score = 0. Security risk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** All at or near 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet. No adjustments needed. The code is a simple, safe class definition for an image tile source extension, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.",
