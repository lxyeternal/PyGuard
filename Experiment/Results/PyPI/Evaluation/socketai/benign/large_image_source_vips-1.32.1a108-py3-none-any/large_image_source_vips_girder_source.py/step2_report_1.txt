  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the evidence for security issues, malware, obfuscation, and risk scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The report confirms the code is a straightforward class definition with no malicious activity, no dynamic data handling, no network or user input, and no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0. These are appropriate.\n- **Risk justification:** The code is purely configuration and inheritance, with no security concerns.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with slightly less confidence (0.9). No suspicious behavior, no dynamic code, no data flow from untrusted sources.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, obfuscated = 0.\n- **Risk justification:** The minor security risk score (0.1) might reflect a cautious stance but is likely overestimating given the code's simplicity.\n- **Recommendation:** Since there's no actual vulnerability or malicious activity, lowering `securityRisk` to 0 would be more consistent.\n- **Scores adjustment:** securityRisk from 0.1 to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above—benign class extension with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, a straightforward class definition, no dynamic behavior, no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n- **Recommendation:** No change.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as previous, benign class extension.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n- **Recommendation:** No change.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code; setting to 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are straightforward, so 0 is correct.\n- **Risk scores:** The only minor concern is Report 2's `securityRisk` of 0.1, which seems slightly overcautious given the code. I recommend setting it to 0 for consistency.\n\n### Final estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk in this code snippet)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a simple class definition with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The scores in the reports are generally appropriate, with a slight adjustment to the `securityRisk` in Report 2. No further action needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:** All scores should be set to malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
