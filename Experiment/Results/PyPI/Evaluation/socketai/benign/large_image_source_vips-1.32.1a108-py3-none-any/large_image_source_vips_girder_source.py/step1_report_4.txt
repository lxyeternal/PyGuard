  "purpose": "Define a custom tile source class for large image processing using Vips and Girder integration.",
  "sources": "Import statements from girder_large_image.girder_tilesource and local module import.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network calls, or data handling functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily defines a class and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from established libraries and defines a new class inheriting from two base classes. It includes class attributes for configuration. No input/output operations, network activity, or data processing occurs here. The class serves as a configuration or interface extension without executing suspicious or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward class definition extending existing image tile source classes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe module for configuring image tile sources.",
