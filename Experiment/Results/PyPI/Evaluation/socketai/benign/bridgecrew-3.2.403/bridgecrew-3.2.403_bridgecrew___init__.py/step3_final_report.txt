  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Potentially suspicious code segments such as eval/exec, network connections, hardcoded secrets, environment variables, and dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, file system, environment variables, subprocess calls, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources like input or environment variables flow into sinks such as network or file operations, possibly via dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, complex string manipulations, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or network activity without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in most reports, with some reports showing suspicious behaviors such as eval/exec and network activity. Scores assigned generally reflect these observations. Report 2 indicates notable suspicious activity, with higher malware (0.6), obfuscation (0.6), and security risk (0.75). Other reports show benign patterns with scores of 0.0 or 0.2. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors, though for Report 2, increasing obfuscation to 0.8 could better reflect suspicion. Overall, the assessments are justified, with minor room for conservative adjustments.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malware and obfuscation scores. Suspicious code in Report 2 justifies higher scores. The current scoring aligns well with the behaviors described. Slightly increasing obfuscation in Report 2 could improve accuracy, but overall, the evaluations are appropriate.",
