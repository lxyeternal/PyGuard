{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing or utility functions typical of a Python package, with no explicit malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input functions (e.g., reading files, environment variables, or user input), network requests, or external dependencies if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through print statements, logging, network transmissions, or file writes; use of eval or exec with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, with no evident untrusted data flow leading to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or hidden backdoors detected; code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard function definitions, import statements, and no signs of obfuscation or unusual dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or unusual variable names. Usage of libraries seems typical, and no network activity or file manipulations suggest malicious behavior. Absence of eval/exec with untrusted input, and no suspicious string manipulations or encoding observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The code appears benign, with no malicious signals detected. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
