  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malware and obfuscation scores. Suspicious code in Report 2 justifies higher scores. The current scoring aligns well with the behaviors described. Slightly increasing obfuscation in Report 2 could improve accuracy, but overall, the evaluations are appropriate."
