  "purpose": "Assign a version string to a variable, indicating the software version.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a direct assignment statement with no external data input.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communications.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward assignment with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to a variable. It involves no input/output, external communication, or complex logic. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is minimal, clear, and typical for version declaration. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version string assignment with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All evaluation scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
