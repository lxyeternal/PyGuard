  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string (`version = '3.2.403'`). There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or complex logic. The code is minimal, standard, and typical for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that this snippet is benign. They correctly note the absence of suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent. No errors or logical flaws are apparent in these evaluations.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Appropriate, as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, since there is no evidence of malicious activity.  \n- **Security Risk Score (0)**: Justified, as the code does not perform any security-sensitive operations or pose risks.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores**  \n- The code does not involve any external data, network communication, or cryptographic operations.  \n- The version string is static and not suspicious.  \n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads are present.  \nTherefore, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Challenging Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent. They focus on the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n6. **Score Consistency**  \nAll scores are consistent with the code snippet and the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)  \n\nGiven the totality of the evidence, I agree with the assessments that this is a benign, standard version declaration snippet with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a simple, benign version assignment with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified. No changes are necessary.",
