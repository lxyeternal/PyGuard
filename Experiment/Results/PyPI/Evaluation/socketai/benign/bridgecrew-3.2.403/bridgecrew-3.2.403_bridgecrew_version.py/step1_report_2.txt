  "purpose": "Defines a version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, untrusted data processing, or sensitive operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows identified due to minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a string value to the variable 'version'. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no security-sensitive operations. The minimal nature of this code suggests it's part of a larger codebase, likely for versioning purposes. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or dynamic code, and no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to define a version identifier. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks in this snippet.",
