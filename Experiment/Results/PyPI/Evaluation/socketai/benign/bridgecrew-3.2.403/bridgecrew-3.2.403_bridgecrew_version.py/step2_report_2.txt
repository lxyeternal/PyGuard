  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to a variable (`version = '3.2.403'`). There are no inputs, outputs, external communications, or complex logic involved. The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for version declaration.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:  \nAll reports agree that there are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code does not contain any suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n- **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, since the code is not obfuscated.  \n- **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, as there's no evidence of malicious intent or activity.  \n- **Security Risk Score (0)**: Correct, because the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Misinterpretations**:  \nGiven the simplicity of the code, any claim of potential vulnerabilities or malicious activity would be unfounded. The reports are consistent and justified in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: Should remain at **0**, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: Should remain at **0**, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: Should be **0**, since the code does not pose any security threat.\n\n### Additional Comments:\nThe reports are thorough and accurate in their analysis. The code snippet is benign, serving only as a version indicator, with no indication of malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0            | No malicious activity or payload present.                  |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | Code is clear, simple, and not obfuscated.                  |\n| Security Risk    | 0            | No security-sensitive operations or vulnerabilities.       |\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis is needed!",
