  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity; standard reading of README.md, importing version, no malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Standard setup; no suspicious operations; external scripts are typical.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to above; standard package setup; no malicious code; dynamic import is common.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Dynamic import of version.py could be a minor concern, but in context, it's typical. No malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — slightly elevated risk score, justified by the dynamic execution of an external file, which could be risky if the file is malicious.  \n- **Justification:** While common, executing external code during setup can be a vector if the file is compromised. Still, in controlled environments, this is generally acceptable.  \n- **Recommendation:** Keep the risk score low unless there's evidence of tampering.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Fully standard setup script; no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a typical setup script.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The only minor concern is the dynamic import of version.py, which is standard but could be a potential vector if the file is malicious. The report assigns a small risk score (0.2), which is reasonable.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to dynamic code execution during setup, which is a common but slightly risky pattern)\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the cautious view on dynamic imports during setup)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe setup script appears benign, following standard practices. The minor risk score reflects the dynamic import of version.py, which is typical but should be noted. No evidence supports higher risk or malware concerns.",
