  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference their conclusions with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Standard setup.py script for a Python package.\n- Reads README.md for long description.\n- Dynamically imports version info from 'bridgecrew/version.py'.\n- Uses setuptools to configure package installation, dependencies, scripts, and metadata.\n- No network activity, user input, or dynamic code execution beyond the import of version.py.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no malicious activity, standard pattern.\n- **Score:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, standard setup script.\n- **Score:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard setup, no suspicious code.\n- **Score:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Slight concern about dynamic import of 'version.py' without validation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Analysis:** The dynamic import of 'version.py' is typical but could be a concern if the file is malicious. However, in a controlled environment, this is standard practice.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable given the potential for malicious 'version.py' but is generally low because the file is expected to be trusted in normal scenarios.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall evaluation:\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware likelihood:** Zero across all reports, consistent with the code.\n- **Risk score:** Generally 0, with a minor 0.2 for the dynamic import concern in report 4, which is justified.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The dynamic import of 'version.py' is common but should ideally be validated or sandboxed in high-security contexts. However, in typical package setup scripts, this pattern is accepted.\n- No evidence of supply chain attack vectors, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, primarily due to the dynamic import of version.py, which is standard but could be considered slightly risky if the file is compromised.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
