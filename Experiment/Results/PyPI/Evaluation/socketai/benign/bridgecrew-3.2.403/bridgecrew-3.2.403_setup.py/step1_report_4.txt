{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'bridgecrew' Python package, including reading the README, dynamically retrieving the version, and defining package dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file, importing 'bridgecrew/version.py' for version information, and potentially reading environment variables or external inputs indirectly via setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "Executing 'spec.loader.exec_module(mod)', which runs the code in 'version.py'; potentially vulnerable if 'version.py' contains malicious code. No other dangerous sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Reading 'version.py' → executing its code to obtain 'version' → passing 'version' to 'install_requires' and package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamically importing and executing 'version.py' without validation; reliance on external file for version info. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the README.md for long description and loads version information dynamically from 'bridgecrew/version.py'. It then uses setuptools to configure package installation, dependencies, and metadata. The dynamic import and execution of 'version.py' is standard for version retrieval but could be risky if the file is malicious; however, in a typical package setup, this file is controlled. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The setup process itself does not include any code injection or network activity.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python package setup script with dynamic version loading. No malicious behavior or malware indications are present. The only minor concern is the dynamic import of 'version.py', which is typical but depends on trusted source control. Overall, the script is benign.\n",
