  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, reading README.md, dynamically importing version info, and configuring dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md, importing 'bridgecrew/version.py' via importlib.util, executing setup() with dependencies and scripts",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'bridgecrew/version.py' during import, which could execute arbitrary code if malicious",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> Importing and executing 'bridgecrew/version.py' -> Running setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import and execution of 'bridgecrew/version.py' could be risky if the file is malicious; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, performing standard operations such as reading a README, importing version info, and calling setup(). The dynamic import of 'version.py' is common but could execute malicious code if the file is compromised. No network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign and follows standard practices. The only minor concern is the dynamic import of 'version.py', which could be risky if the file is malicious. Overall, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation, and the security risk is minimal.",
