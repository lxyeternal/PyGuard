{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'bridgecrew' Python package, mainly for package installation and metadata configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file; loads version information from bridgecrew/version.py; gathers package dependencies and scripts.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sink that processes untrusted input or performs data leaks; no network or file output based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a local file; passes version to 'install_requires'; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard setup script structure; dynamic import of version info is typical in setup.py.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files (README.md and version.py) to configure package metadata. It uses standard setuptools functions. No malicious code or suspicious behaviors such as network communication, code execution, or data exfiltration are present. No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical package metadata configuration without any suspicious behaviors.",
