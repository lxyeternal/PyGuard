  "purpose": "Setup script for the bridgecrew Python package, including dependency management and package configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, importing version from bridgecrew/version.py, and specifying dependencies and scripts.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; setup process and file reading are standard and safe.",
  "flows": "Read README.md -> import version -> use version in install_requires and package metadata",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The import and dynamic execution of version.py is standard for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code loads package metadata, reads a README file, dynamically imports a version module, and sets up package installation parameters. All operations are typical for a Python package setup script. No indications of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling were observed. The dynamic import of version.py is a common pattern and does not pose security risks in this context.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a standard, benign package configuration for a Python project. No malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are evident.",
