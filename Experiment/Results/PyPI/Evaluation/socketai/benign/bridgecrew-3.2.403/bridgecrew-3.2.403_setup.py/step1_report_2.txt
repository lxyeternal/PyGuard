{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'bridgecrew' Python package, including dependencies, metadata, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long_description; loads version info from bridgecrew/version.py; uses hardcoded dependencies and script files.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes external scripts ('bin/bridgecrew', 'bin/bridgecrew.cmd') via setuptools; loads module from file.",
  "flows": "Reads version from version.py -> uses version in install_requires and setup() -> executes scripts during installation.",
  "anomalies": "None of the code performs unusual or suspicious operations; reliance on external scripts is standard for setup packages.",
  "analysis": "The script reads package metadata and dependencies, loads version info dynamically from a file, and calls setuptools.setup() to configure packaging. It does not include any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code. The loading of version info from an external file and execution of scripts are typical in setup routines. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain attacks. It follows common practices for package configuration and does not contain malicious behaviors.",
