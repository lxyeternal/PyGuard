{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup script for a Python package, specifically for the 'bridgecrew' package, managing dependencies, metadata, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description; importing version from bridgecrew/version.py; reading environment variables or files only indirectly through package metadata and setup configurations.",
  "sinks": "Execution of setup() function, which installs dependencies and package files; no data is sent or received externally, no untrusted input is processed in a dangerous way.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setting up package metadata -> executing setup() with dependencies and package info; no untrusted data flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic observed. The code uses standard setup procedures. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution found.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations: reading a README file, importing a version number from a local module, and configuring package metadata and dependencies through setuptools. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. The only dynamic aspect is importing version info from a local file, which is common and safe. The script does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs, nor does it access environment variables or sensitive data. It is a typical setup script aligned with best practices, with no signs of supply chain attack vectors or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard Python package setup file with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical operations for packaging and distribution, with no anomalous or suspicious code identified.",
