  "purpose": "Define a banner string with ASCII art and version information for display purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from bridgecrew.version to retrieve version information; the variable 'version' is sourced from an external module.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a formatted string to a variable; no direct data sinks are present. No untrusted data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "The 'version' variable flows into the string formatting for display but originates from a static import; no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version number from an external module and constructs a banner string with ASCII art and the version info. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or insecure practices. It is a simple display setup, typical for CLI tools.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign banner display with version information. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are present. It appears to be standard, harmless code.",
