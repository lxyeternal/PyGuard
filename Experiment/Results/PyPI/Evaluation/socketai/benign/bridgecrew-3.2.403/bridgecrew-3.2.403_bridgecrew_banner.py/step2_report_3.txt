  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Behavior & Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports agree that the code is a straightforward banner display that imports a version string from an external module and formats it into a static ASCII art banner. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation. The code is purely for display purposes.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, and no issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is simple, static, and free from malicious behavior or obfuscation. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo corrections needed; the reports are sound.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, as the code is straightforward.  \n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity.  \n- **Security risk score (0):** Correct, no vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\nAll scores align with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is entirely benign, there is no justification for higher risk scores. The risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate given the code's harmless nature.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nNo claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are based on unfounded assumptions. The analysis is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nAll scores are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (benign, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, static banner display with no security concerns.**",
