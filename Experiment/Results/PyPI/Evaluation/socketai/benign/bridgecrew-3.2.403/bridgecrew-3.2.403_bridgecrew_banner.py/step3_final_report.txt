  "purpose": "Display a banner with the current version of the software.",
  "sources": "Importing version string from 'bridgecrew.version' module.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "Import from 'bridgecrew.version' -> format into banner string -> display.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static code, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from an internal module and formats it into an ASCII banner for display. It contains no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward, static, and serves solely for informational purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended only for display. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current assessment and scores are justified and accurate.",
