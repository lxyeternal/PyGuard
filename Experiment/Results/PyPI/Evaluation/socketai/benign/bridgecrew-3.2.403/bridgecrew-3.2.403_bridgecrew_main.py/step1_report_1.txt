{
  "purpose": "This script appears to run the Checkov security tool with a banner and tool parameter, and provides deprecation notices.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data directly; it imports functions from 'bridgecrew.banner' and 'checkov.main'.",
  "sinks": "The only potential sink is the 'exit' call with the return code from Checkov, which could influence system state if misused, but not malicious by itself.",
  "flows": "The flow involves running Checkov with parameters and then exiting with its code; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The script is straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports banner and tool for displaying information, and Checkov for security scanning. It runs Checkov with provided parameters and exits with the same code. It includes a deprecation notice. No input data, user input, or external data sources are handled. The code functions as a wrapper for Checkov execution, with no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. It appears to be a simple, benign utility script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign wrapper for running the Checkov security scanner, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It mainly serves as an entry point for executing Checkov with specific parameters and displaying deprecation info.",
