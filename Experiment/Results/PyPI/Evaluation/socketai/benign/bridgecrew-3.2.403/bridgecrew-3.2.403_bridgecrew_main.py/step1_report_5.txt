{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a wrapper to run the Checkov security scanning tool with a custom banner and tool name, and displays a deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'bridgecrew.banner' and 'checkov.main', the call to 'Checkov().run()', and the print statements.",
  "sinks": "The 'exit' call which terminates the program based on the result of 'Checkov().run()'.",
  "flows": "The script initializes Checkov, runs it, and exits with its return code; prior to that, it prints a deprecation message.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard use of imports and function calls. No hardcoded secrets or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports and executes the 'Checkov' security scanning tool, which is a legitimate open-source project for static code analysis of infrastructure as code. The script includes a deprecation warning indicating it's outdated and suggests using 'checkov' directly. The 'run' function executes Checkov and exits with its result, which is typical for a command-line utility wrapper. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The code's simplicity and transparency do not raise security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code acts as a simple wrapper around the Checkov tool with a deprecation notice. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward, benign script designed to facilitate running Checkov with a custom banner, and all observed behavior aligns with legitimate functionality.",
