{
  "purpose": "The script runs the Checkov security scanning tool with a banner and tool parameter, and provides deprecation warnings to users.",
  "sources": "Import statements for banner, tool from bridgecrew.banner and Checkov from checkov.main; print statements for deprecation warnings; run() function calling Checkov().run()",
  "sinks": "The run() method may execute Checkov, which could perform security scans; print statements output messages; exit() terminates script execution",
  "flows": "Imports -> run() function invoking Checkov().run() -> outputs deprecation warnings -> executes Checkov scan -> terminates based on exit code",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a deprecation warning indicating the project is unsupported; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual or obfuscated code present; standard import and execution pattern",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing modules and running a security scanner. It issues a deprecation warning before executing the scanner. No malicious behavior or suspicious code patterns are detected. The script simply delegates to the Checkov tool and then exits based on its result.",
  "conclusion": "This script acts as a wrapper for running the Checkov security scanner with a deprecation notice. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script guiding users to a supported tool.",
