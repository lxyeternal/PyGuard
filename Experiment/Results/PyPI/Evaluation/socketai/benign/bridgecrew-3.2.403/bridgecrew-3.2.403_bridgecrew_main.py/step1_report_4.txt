{
  "purpose": "This script runs the Checkov security scanning tool with a banner, likely as part of a CI/CD pipeline or local security check process.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'bridgecrew.banner' and 'checkov.main', and the 'run' function which calls Checkov().",
  "sinks": "The 'exit' function which terminates the program with the code returned by Checkov().",
  "flows": "Imports -> run() -> Checkov().run() -> exit()",
  "anomalies": "The script contains deprecated notices and encourages migration to 'checkov', but no suspicious code or unusual behavior is present. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules for banners and the main Checkov scanner. The 'run' function executes the scanner and exits with its code. The main block prints deprecation warnings, suggesting the script is obsolete. There are no data leaks, code injections, or malicious behaviors detected. The script serves as a simple wrapper to invoke Checkov with a banner.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward wrapper around the Checkov tool with deprecation notices. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks in this code fragment.",
