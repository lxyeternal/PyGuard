{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a wrapper to run the Checkov security scanning tool, displaying a deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'bridgecrew.banner' and 'checkov.main'; call to Checkov().run() method; print statements for deprecation notice.",
  "sinks": "Checkov's run method execution could potentially process untrusted inputs if user parameters are involved; print statements output static messages.",
  "flows": "Imports -> run() function -> Checkov().run() -> exit_code handling; prints deprecation messages; calls Checkov's run method.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; no hardcoded credentials; no dynamic code execution; standard use of library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a run() function that executes the Checkov scanner. It handles the exit code appropriately. The script includes a deprecation warning via print statements and then calls run(). There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or data leaks. The reliance on external libraries is standard for such a utility, and no suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward wrapper for the Checkov security scanner with a deprecation notice. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe for use, assuming the imported libraries are legitimate and secure.",
