  "purpose": "A wrapper script to run the Checkov security scanner with a deprecation notice.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'bridgecrew.banner' and 'checkov.main'; static print statements.",
  "sinks": "Execution of Checkov's run method, system exit with its code.",
  "flows": "Script calls Checkov().run() and exits; no untrusted data flows or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, benign wrapper around the Checkov security tool, with no user input, data leaks, or malicious behavior. It imports external libraries, executes a method, and exits. The deprecation notices are static prints. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the code's nature and the deprecation warning, which is informational, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, straightforward utility with no malicious intent or security issues. The current scores are accurate and consistent with the code's benign behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
