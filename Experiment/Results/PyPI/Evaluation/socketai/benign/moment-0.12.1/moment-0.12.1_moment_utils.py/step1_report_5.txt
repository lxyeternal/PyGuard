  "purpose": "Provide compatibility support for Python 2 and 3 by defining type tuples and iteration functions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, data parameter passed to _iteritems function",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data sinks or untrusted data processing points",
  "flows": "sys.version_info influences control flow; _iteritems determines method called on data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded values are standard for compatibility code",
  "analysis": "The code detects Python version and adjusts type definitions and iteration methods accordingly. No untrusted input or data handling, no external data sources, nor any suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and intended solely for compatibility, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard compatibility code for supporting Python 2 and 3. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks present.",
