  "purpose": "Define compatibility utilities for Python 2 and 3, specifically for string types and dictionary iteration.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, which reads Python version information from the system environment.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info is checked to determine the appropriate string type and iteration method.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard compatibility adjustments.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to maintain compatibility between Python 2 and 3. It defines STRING_TYPES based on the Python version and provides a helper function _iteritems to abstract dictionary iteration differences. All constructs are standard and widely used for compatibility purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code does not process external inputs, nor does it include any data leak or harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility utility for Python versions prior to and after 3.0. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and poses no security risks.",
