  "purpose": "Provides compatibility support for Python 2 and 3 by defining string type and item iteration functions.",
  "sources": "Reads the Python version from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted input or output.",
  "flows": "Uses sys.version_info to determine code flow for compatibility functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows standard compatibility practices with no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a tuple STRING_TYPES that adapts to the Python version, and a function _iteritems that returns the appropriate iterator method depending on the Python version. It uses sys.version_info to check the environment and adjusts accordingly. No user input, no external data sources, and no data sinks are present. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility shim for Python 2/3 support with no malicious intent or security risks.",
