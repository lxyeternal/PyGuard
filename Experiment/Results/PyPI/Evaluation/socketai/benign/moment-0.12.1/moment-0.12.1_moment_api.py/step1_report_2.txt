{
  "purpose": "Provides simple API functions to create date/moment objects using an underlying Moment class.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.core' and function parameters such as *args and timestamp.",
  "sinks": "None; functions return Moment objects without processing untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Input arguments (*args, timestamp) flow into Moment class methods; no external or untrusted data flows into other parts of the code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. No dynamic code execution or hidden logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward wrapper functions around the Moment class, facilitating date creation with various time zones and formats. No input sanitization issues, no external network calls, no data leakage, or other malicious patterns. The imports are from a local module, and the functions primarily delegate to the Moment class methods. There are no signs of malicious code or suspicious activity. Overall, the code is simple, clean, and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a basic API layer for creating date objects and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard, safe, and non-obfuscated.",
