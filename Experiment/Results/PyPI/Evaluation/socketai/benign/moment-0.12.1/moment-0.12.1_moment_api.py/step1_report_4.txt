  "purpose": "Provides simple API functions to create Moment objects in various ways.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as *args and timestamp in unix().",
  "sinks": "Return statements that instantiate Moment objects; no direct data leaks or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into Moment class methods; no external data flows or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The code mainly delegates to the Moment class.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions that wrap around the Moment class for creating date objects in different ways. All functions simply call class methods or constructors with provided parameters. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system modification, or malicious network activity. The code appears to be straightforward API wrapper functions with no suspicious logic or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign API wrapper for date/time creation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
