  "purpose": "Provides simple API functions for creating Moment objects using various input methods.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to functions (args, timestamp, utc flag).",
  "sinks": "Return statements that instantiate Moment objects; no direct data leaks or external calls.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into Moment methods; no external data flow or untrusted sources observed.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines wrapper functions that delegate to the Moment class for date creation. It accepts arguments for date construction but does not process or validate them in a suspicious manner. No external data sources, network calls, or sensitive operations are present. The functions are simple pass-throughs for the Moment class methods, which are not provided here but presumably standard date handling functions. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The code is clean, straightforward, and aligns with common date utility patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple API wrapper for date/time creation using the Moment class. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It appears to be benign and primarily serves as an interface for date-time operations.",
