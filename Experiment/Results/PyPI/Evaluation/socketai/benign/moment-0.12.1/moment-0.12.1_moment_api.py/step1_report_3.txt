{
  "purpose": "Provides simple API functions to create Moment objects using various time inputs and time zones.",
  "sources": "User calls to functions 'date', 'now', 'utc', 'utcnow', and 'unix', which then invoke corresponding Moment class methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process or output untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Input functions pass parameters to Moment class methods; no untrusted data flows to external systems or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines wrapper functions for the Moment class, which is imported from a local module. Each function simply calls the corresponding method on the Moment class, passing parameters as received. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not include any dynamic execution, external network calls, or data manipulation that could indicate malicious intent. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The functions serve as simple abstractions for date/time creation and are unlikely to be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign API wrapper providing date/time creation functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe utility module.",
