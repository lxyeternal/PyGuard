  "purpose": "Provide simple API functions to create Moment objects using various time inputs and time zones.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: args in date(), timestamp in unix(), internal calls to Moment methods.",
  "sinks": "Return statements calling Moment methods; no external data sinks or network calls observed.",
  "flows": "Input arguments (args, timestamp) flow into Moment methods; results returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and acts as a wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code defines wrapper functions around the Moment class to create date objects in different ways. No external data input sources such as network, environment variables, or files are involved. The functions merely pass parameters to the imported Moment class methods and return the result. The implementation appears standard, with no signs of malicious code or backdoors. No unusual or suspicious behaviors are present. The code’s simplicity and direct use of imported methods suggest no hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple wrapper API for date/time creation, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and intentionally designed for date handling.",
