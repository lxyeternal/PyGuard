  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for creating date/time objects via the Moment class.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to functions (args, timestamp, utc flags).",
  "sinks": "Delegation to Moment class methods; no direct sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow directly into Moment class methods without modification.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward wrapper functions with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple wrapper around the Moment class, delegating date/time creation functions. No external data sources, network calls, or data leaks are present. The functions do not process or validate inputs beyond passing them through. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a straightforward API wrapper for date/time creation, and no issues are present.",
