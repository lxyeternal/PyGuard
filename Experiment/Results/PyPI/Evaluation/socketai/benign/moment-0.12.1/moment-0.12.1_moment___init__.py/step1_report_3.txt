  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simply importing modules",
  "anomalies": "Uses relative imports, which is standard in package modules; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules. There are no indications of external data input, data transmission, or execution of untrusted code. Importing modules is standard practice in Python packages and does not suggest malicious intent. No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behavior are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and typical for Python packages. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in these import statements.",
