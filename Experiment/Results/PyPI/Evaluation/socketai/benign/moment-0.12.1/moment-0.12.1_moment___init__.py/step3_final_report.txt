  "purpose": "Module setup via import statements, primarily for including components from local modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .api and .core modules",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data sources; no external input or output",
  "flows": "Import statements load symbols into namespace; no data flow or execution beyond imports",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (`from .api import *`) which can obscure imported symbols and reduce clarity",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, with no code execution, data processing, or network activity. The wildcard import is discouraged for maintainability but does not inherently introduce malicious behavior. Relative imports are standard in package modules. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal code aligns with benign module initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard module setup with import statements. The only concern is the use of wildcard import, which is a style and maintainability issue rather than a security threat. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
