  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from local modules 'api' and 'core', specifically the 'Moment' class.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules within the package, no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data transmissions present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows evident; just module imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can obscure what is imported and may hide malicious code, but on its own, it is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs imports from local modules using wildcard syntax, which is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious. No data handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are visible. The code is minimal and appears to be a part of a larger package's setup or initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It merely imports components from local modules. No evidence of malware or security issues based on this snippet.",
