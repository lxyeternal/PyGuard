  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from a local module 'api' and a specific class 'Moment' from a local module 'core'.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules 'api' and 'core'. No external input or data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data output, network operations, or system commands are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are identifiable in this minimal code fragment, as it only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple import statements from local modules, which is standard in Python. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The lack of further code prevents detailed analysis, but based solely on these lines, there is no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a straightforward import statement with no malicious or security-related concerns identified. It appears to be part of a larger, benign codebase.",
