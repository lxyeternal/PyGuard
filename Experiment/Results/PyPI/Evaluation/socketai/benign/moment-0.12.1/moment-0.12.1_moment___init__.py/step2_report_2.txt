  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code snippets.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet:\n  ```python\n  from .api import *\n  from .core import Moment\n  ```\n- The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements.\n- The use of relative imports and wildcard import from `.api` are noted but are common in package initialization.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues in the code:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malicious code, such as dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code content.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is accurate given the code's clarity.\n- **Security risks:** The overall security risk is minimal, mostly related to maintainability concerns rather than security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Anomalies or logical flaws:\n- **Wildcard import (`from .api import *`):** While discouraged, it is common in package __init__.py files or module setup. It can hide imported symbols, but it does not imply malicious intent.\n- **Relative imports:** Standard practice in package modules; no issues here.\n- **No data flow or external data:** No evidence of data processing, external input, or network activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** No actual security issues or malicious behavior are present in these snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Review of scores and reasoning:\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, appropriate.\n- **Malware:** All are 0, appropriate.\n- **SecurityRisk:** Mostly low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting potential maintainability concerns, not security flaws.\n- **Confidence levels:** Ranging from 0.7 to 1, consistent with the minimal code and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n**Any suggested changes?**\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correct.\n- The security risk scores could be slightly increased if the wildcard import is considered a security concern, but generally, this is more about code clarity and maintainability rather than security.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- Since no malicious activity is detected, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The scores should remain low, emphasizing that these snippets are benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (as currently assigned), possibly up to 0.3 if considering maintainability concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- The use of wildcard import is a maintainability concern but not a security issue.\n- The current scores are appropriate and should not be significantly changed.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the existing assessments.**",
