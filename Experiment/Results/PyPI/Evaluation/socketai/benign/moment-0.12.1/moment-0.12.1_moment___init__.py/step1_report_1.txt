{
  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from the 'api' module and the 'Moment' class from the 'core' module, likely for setting up a package or module namespace.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.api and .core)",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing observed",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are evident; only imports are present",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import from '.api' could obscure what is imported, but this is common in package initialization. No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements, which are standard for package or module setup. No data processing, user input, or external connections are present. The use of wildcard import may reduce code clarity but does not imply malicious intent. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module initializer or setup script with standard import statements. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
