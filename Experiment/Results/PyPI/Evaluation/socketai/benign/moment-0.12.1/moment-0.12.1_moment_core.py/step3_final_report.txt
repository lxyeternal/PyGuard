  "purpose": "A date/time utility class providing creation, formatting, timezone adjustments, and cloning functionalities for datetime objects.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to constructors and class methods, external libraries (pytz, times), external parsing functions (parse_date_and_formula, parse_js_date).",
  "sinks": "Internal datetime objects, formatted date strings, timezone conversions, internal state modifications.",
  "flows": "Input data (args, timestamps, zones) -> parsing functions -> internal _date attribute -> formatting or timezone methods -> output strings or updated internal state.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. Broad exception handling in timezone() method is noted but typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward date/time utility class that wraps standard Python libraries and custom parsing functions. It provides methods for creating date objects in various ways, formatting them, adjusting time zones, and cloning. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. External parsing functions are used but assumed safe. Exception handling is broad but not suspicious. No signs of obfuscation or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured date/time utility with no malicious behavior or supply chain issues. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
