  "purpose": "Utility class and functions for manipulating and handling mutable datetime objects with various date arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Initialization of date object in __init__, date parsing and replacement methods, and property accessors.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that lead to data leakage or untrusted external interaction. No network, file, or environment variable access observed.",
  "flows": "Input date data flows through class methods for modification or retrieval; no untrusted input handling or external data sources detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation present. Functions perform standard date arithmetic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utilities for date manipulation, including adding/subtracting months, years, weeks, days, and other units. It handles date replacement and epoch calculation. No external data sources, network activity, or insecure operations are present. The logic is straightforward and uses standard Python libraries and known algorithms. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard date utility library with no malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on date objects without external interactions or sensitive data handling. No malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
