  "purpose": "Provides functions for parsing and converting date strings and formats, including translating JavaScript date format strings to Python's strftime format.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are user-provided date strings, format strings, and arguments to functions.",
  "sinks": "Parsed date objects and formatted date strings, which are returned by functions. No direct data leak or system command execution occurs.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed and potentially transformed into date objects or formatted strings, with no external communication or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. The code mainly performs string replacements and parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs date parsing and format translation, including converting JavaScript date format strings into Python's strftime format. It uses standard libraries (datetime, dateparser) and custom functions to handle argument parsing and string replacements. No external network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration are present. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are evident. The operations are straightforward and align with typical date parsing utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard date parsing utility with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not handle sensitive data insecurely nor perform any harmful operations.",
