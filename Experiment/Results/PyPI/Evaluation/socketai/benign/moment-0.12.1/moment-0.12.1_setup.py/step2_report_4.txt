  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Potential Issues:**\n   - The provided setup script appears standard for a Python package, with no obvious malicious code or suspicious behavior.\n   - The dependencies listed include `dateparser`, `pytz`, and `times`. These are common libraries, and their specified versions seem reasonable.\n   - The classifiers indicate \"Development Status :: 1 - Planning,\" which suggests the package might be in early development, but that doesn't imply malicious intent.\n   - No inline code or logic that could be malicious or obfuscated is present.\n\n2. **Review of Reports:**\n   - All reports are empty responses with no details provided.\n   - Without specific reports, it's impossible to identify errors, flaws, or malicious activity based on the reports.\n   - The absence of reports prevents any evaluation of potential vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Since no reports provide concrete findings, any assigned malware, obfuscated, or risk scores would be speculative.\n   - The package code itself appears benign, and with no reports indicating issues, the scores should be low or zero.\n   - The only potential concern is the \"Development Status\" classifier indicating early development, which might warrant a slight risk consideration but not necessarily high scores.\n\n4. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - Based solely on the code provided, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant risk.\n   - The empty reports prevent any further analysis or validation.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal risk due to early development status, but not significant)\n\n**Summary:**\nGiven the available data, the package appears safe, and the reports do not provide any additional information to alter this assessment. If actual reports or code snippets indicating issues become available, a re-evaluation would be necessary.",
