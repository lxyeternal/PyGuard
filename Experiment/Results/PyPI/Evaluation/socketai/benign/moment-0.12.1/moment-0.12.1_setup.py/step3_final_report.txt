  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'moment' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, dependencies, and import fallback logic in setup script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code execution or network operations present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, obfuscation, or embedded malicious logic; straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script, importing 'setuptools' or 'distutils.core' with no embedded executable code or network activity. Dependencies are common and versioned reasonably. All reports are empty, indicating no identified issues or claims of malicious behavior. The package metadata and classifiers are standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Given the lack of evidence, the code appears benign, and the security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is standard, free of malicious or suspicious code, and the reports do not indicate any issues. The package appears safe, with no malware or obfuscation detected. Scores are set to zero for malware and obfuscation, and a negligible risk score is appropriate.",
