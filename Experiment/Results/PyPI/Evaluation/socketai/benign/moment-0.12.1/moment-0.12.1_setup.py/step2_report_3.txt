  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code.**  \nAll reports are empty (\"Empty response\"), so there are no explicit issues or concerns raised in the reports to evaluate.\n\n**Step 2: Review the code for potential issues, vulnerabilities, or flaws.**  \n- The code is a typical setup.py script for a Python package.\n- It uses a try-except block to import `setuptools`, falling back to `distutils.core` if necessary.\n- The package metadata appears standard.\n- The `install_requires` list includes `\"dateparser>=0.7\"`, `\"pytz>=2018.9\"`, and `\"times>=0.7\"`.\n\n**Step 3: Check for potential security issues or malicious behavior.**  \n- No suspicious code, such as dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscated code, is present.\n- The dependencies listed are common and open-source, with no indication of malicious intent.\n- The package name \"moment\" and author details are straightforward.\n\n**Step 4: Review the scores and their justifications.**  \n- Since no issues are reported, and the code appears standard, the malware score should be very low or zero.\n- The obfuscated score is also likely zero, as there's no obfuscation.\n- The risk score should be minimal, close to zero, unless external factors are considered.\n\n**Step 5: Final assessment and recommendations.**  \n- Given the absence of any issues, malicious activity, or obfuscation, I would assign the following scores:\n  - **Malware score:** 0.0\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n  - **Risk score:** 0.1 (to account for the minimal inherent risk in package setup files, but effectively negligible)\n\n**Step 6: Additional considerations.**  \n- The empty reports do not provide any specific concerns or evidence of issues.\n- The code is standard, with no signs of compromise or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Aspect                | Score | Justification                                                                                     |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware score        | 0.0    | No malicious code or behavior detected in the setup script.                                    |\n| Obfuscated score     | 0.0    | No obfuscation present; code is straightforward.                                                 |\n| Risk score           | 0.1    | Minimal risk inherent in package setup files; no active threats identified.                   |\n\n**Final note:**  \nAll reports are empty, and based on the provided code, there are no apparent security issues. The scores reflect a clean assessment.",
