{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to create and manage EMR Serverless applications and jobs on AWS, including creating applications, submitting jobs, and waiting for job completion.",
  "sources": "AWS SDK boto3 client calls to 'emr-serverless' service, reading response data; function parameters for input values like application IDs, role ARNs, job args, configurations.",
  "sinks": "AWS SDK methods that send data to AWS services; logging statements outputting responses; return statements returning IDs or response data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (application IDs, role ARNs, job configurations) flow into boto3 client method calls; responses from AWS are processed and returned; wait_job polls for job status until completion.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive data; no use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or misleading variable names; no network communications outside AWS SDK; no data exfiltration or suspicious backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly interfaces with AWS EMR Serverless via boto3, creating applications and running jobs with parameters supplied externally. It includes standard logging, waiting loops, and error handling. No signs of malicious behavior such as data theft, backdoors, or hidden network activity are present. Functions are straightforward wrappers around AWS SDK with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured wrapper for AWS EMR Serverless management, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It securely interacts with AWS services and performs job management tasks. No malicious or security-risk code is detected.",
