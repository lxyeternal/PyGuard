  "purpose": "Management and orchestration of AWS EMR Serverless applications and jobs via boto3 SDK wrappers.",
  "sources": "AWS SDK API calls, input parameters, and response objects.",
  "sinks": "AWS API endpoints; logs (debug level).",
  "flows": "User parameters -> boto3 API requests -> AWS responses -> logs/return values.",
  "anomalies": "None suspicious; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured wrapper around AWS SDK for managing EMR Serverless applications and jobs. It uses explicit parameters, handles responses securely, and logs responses at debug level. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The use of standard SDK practices and absence of obfuscation or suspicious patterns indicate a benign and secure implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure utility for AWS EMR Serverless management. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified, mainly reflecting potential misuse if parameters are maliciously crafted, but no actual vulnerabilities are present.",
