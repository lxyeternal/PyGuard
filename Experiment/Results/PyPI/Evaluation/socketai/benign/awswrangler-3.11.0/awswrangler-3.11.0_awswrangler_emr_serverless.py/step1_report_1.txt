{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to create and manage EMR Serverless applications and jobs on AWS, including application creation, job submission, and waiting for job completion.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function parameters such as 'name', 'release_label', 'application_id', 'execution_role_arn', 'job_driver_args', 'configuration_overrides', 'tags', 'execution_timeout', and 'name'. It also reads data from AWS services via boto3 client responses.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks include the boto3 AWS SDK calls which interact with AWS services and could transmit data. The code does not write data to external locations or system components directly, but responses from AWS are logged.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-provided parameters into AWS SDK calls, which then return responses. In 'run_job', response data flows into wait_job if 'wait' is True, where it polls job status until completion or failure.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code adheres to typical AWS SDK usage patterns. No obfuscated code or malicious data handling is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines structured types and functions for managing EMR Serverless applications and jobs. It uses secure and standard AWS SDK calls. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious commands are present. Logging is used for debugging. The functions handle job status polling and error raising appropriately. No signs of malicious data exfiltration, code injection, or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured module for managing AWS EMR Serverless resources. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. It follows best practices for AWS SDK interactions and data handling. The overall security risk is low.",
