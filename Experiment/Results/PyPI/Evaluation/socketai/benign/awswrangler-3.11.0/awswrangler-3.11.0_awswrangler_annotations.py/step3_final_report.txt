  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for issuing warnings about deprecated and experimental features, including docstring modifications.",
  "sources": "Reads function __doc__, uses external config from awswrangler._config, and function names.",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn() calls, modifications to function __doc__ strings.",
  "flows": "Decorators wrap functions, issue warnings, and modify docstrings before function execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python warning and decorator patterns to inform users about API status. It reads configuration to control warning suppression, modifies docstrings to include notes, and issues warnings via warnings.warn(). The implementation is straightforward, with no external data processing or network activity. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The code's purpose is purely informational and documentation-related, with minimal security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for managing warnings about deprecated and experimental features. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The warning messages are static and do not leak sensitive information. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1), reflecting minimal potential for misuse.",
