  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions/classes for warnings about deprecated/experimental features.\n- Sources: Reads function __doc__, uses external config.\n- Sinks: warnings.warn, modifies __doc__.\n- Flows: Decorators wrap functions, issue warnings, modify docstrings.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious behavior, no malicious code.\n- Analysis: Straightforward, standard pattern, no external data processing beyond warnings.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no malicious activity, security risks minimal.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low), confidence=1.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Warning/deprecation decorators, documentation injection.\n- Sources: Function docstrings, config.\n- Sinks: warnings.warn, modifies __doc__.\n- Flows: Decorators issue warnings, modify documentation.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Standard warning pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Benign utility code, no security risks.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Warning and annotation functions for AWS SDK.\n- Sources: Function docstrings, config.\n- Sinks: warnings.warn, modifies __doc__.\n- Flows: Similar pattern, decorators issue warnings.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Typical pattern, no external threats.\n- Conclusion: Benign, documentation/notification utility.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Warning decorators, annotations.\n- Sources: Config, warnings.warn.\n- Sinks: warnings.warn, modifies __doc__.\n- Flows: Decorators issue warnings based on config.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Standard pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Benign, minimal security concern.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Warning decorators, documentation.\n- Sources: Config, function metadata.\n- Sinks: warnings.warn, modifies __doc__.\n- Flows: Similar pattern.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious behavior.\n- Analysis: Typical warning/decorator pattern.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely for warnings and documentation modifications.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code (warnings, documentation), the risk is minimal. The only slight concern is the use of warnings which could potentially leak information if warning messages contain sensitive data, but in this code, messages are static and not sensitive.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, as there's no malicious code.\n- Obfuscated remains at 0; code is clear.\n- Risk scores are appropriately low, but a slight risk (0.1) is assigned in some reports due to the potential for warnings to leak info, which is standard practice.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes needed; the code is safe and standard.\n- The overall security posture is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard utility module for warning and documentation purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate given the code's function and implementation.",
