{
  "purpose": "This module provides warning and deprecation decorators for AWS SDK for Pandas, including functions to inject notes into documentation.",
  "sources": "Reading function docstrings, input parameters for warning messages, configuration flags from awswrangler._config",
  "sinks": "Warnings issued via the warnings.warn() function, modifications to function __doc__ attributes",
  "flows": "Decorators capture function calls, issue warnings, and modify docstrings before executing the original function",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Usage of standard Python warnings and decorators is typical. No obfuscated or misleading code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines warning classes and functions to inject warning messages into documentation and function calls. It relies on standard Python libraries and awswrangler configuration. No suspicious data flows, no input/output that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions. No unusual or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for warning management related to deprecated and experimental APIs. No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks was found.",
