  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward utility module for issuing warnings about deprecated and experimental features.\n- It modifies function docstrings to include warning notes.\n- Warnings are issued via Python's standard `warnings.warn()` function, with conditional suppression based on configuration.\n- No external data input, code execution, or network activity is involved.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code relies on standard Python features and a configuration object from `awswrangler._config`.\n- The purpose is purely informational and documentation-related, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any security vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n- The warnings are standard and do not leak sensitive data.\n- No evidence of supply chain attack vectors or malicious payloads.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The code's design is simple and correct for its purpose.\n- The only minor note: the `securityRisk` score is consistently set to 0.1, which might be slightly high given the benign nature, but since it involves warnings that could potentially expose internal implementation details if misused, this is acceptable.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. The code is not malicious.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1. Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0.1 is reasonable, reflecting minimal potential for misuse, but not indicating a real threat.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- Warnings could be used to leak internal information if warning messages contain sensitive data, but in this code, messages are static and do not include sensitive info.\n- The use of warnings could be suppressed or ignored, but that is standard behavior and not a security concern.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a benign utility for managing warnings.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.05 to 0.1 — very low, primarily because warnings could potentially expose some internal details if messages were misused, but currently, they are benign.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe utility module for warning management, with no security risks or malicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
