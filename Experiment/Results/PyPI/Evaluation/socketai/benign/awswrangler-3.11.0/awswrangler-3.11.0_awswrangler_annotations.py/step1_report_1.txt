{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions and classes for warning users about deprecated and experimental features in a Python SDK, including decorators for warning messages.",
  "sources": "The code reads the function's __doc__ attribute and uses a configuration object 'config' from an external library 'awswrangler._config'. It also accesses function metadata such as __name__.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn function, which outputs warning messages to the console or logs, potentially exposing information if warnings contain sensitive data. No direct data leaks or harmful actions are present.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves documentation strings and config settings, then conditionally issues warnings when decorated functions are called, without processing untrusted input or producing external effects beyond warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors. The code mainly involves standard warning and decorator patterns.",
  "analysis": "The module is straightforward, providing warning decorators and classes for deprecated and experimental features. It accesses configuration settings and modifies function documentation. There are no external data inputs or outputs that could lead to injection, leakage, or malicious actions. The use of warnings is standard and does not pose security risks. No obfuscation or malware-like patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for warning users about API status, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It simply decorates functions with warning messages and modifies docstrings, which is common practice.",
