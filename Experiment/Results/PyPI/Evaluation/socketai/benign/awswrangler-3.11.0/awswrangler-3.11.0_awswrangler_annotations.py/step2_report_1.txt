  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Utility for warning about deprecated/experimental features.\n- **Analysis:** Uses standard warnings, modifies docstrings, no external data, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the fact that warnings could potentially leak info if warnings are verbose or contain sensitive info, but this is standard behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility code, no security issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, warning decorators for API status.\n- **Analysis:** Standard Python practices, no suspicious code, no data leaks.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Warning and annotation functions for SDK.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward, no suspicious patterns, no malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — similar reasoning as above, minimal risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Warning decorators for SDK.\n- **Analysis:** Standard practices, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Warning decorators, similar to others.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, straightforward.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code correctness:** All reports agree the code is straightforward, using standard Python warning and decorator patterns.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign malware score 0, which is consistent; no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign obfuscated score 0, consistent with the code being clear and readable.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in most reports, justified by the potential for warnings to leak sensitive info if misused, but overall very low.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a benign utility module for issuing warnings about deprecated and experimental features.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, justified by the potential for warnings to leak info if warnings are verbose or contain sensitive data.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and poses negligible security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.",
