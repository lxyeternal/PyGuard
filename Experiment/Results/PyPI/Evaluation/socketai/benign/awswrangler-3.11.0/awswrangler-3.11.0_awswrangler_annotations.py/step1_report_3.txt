{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for warning messages and documentation injection in the context of AWS SDK for Pandas, including decorators for deprecated and experimental features.",
  "sources": "The code reads function docstrings and function calls to display warnings.",
  "sinks": "The warnings are displayed via the warnings.warn() function, which outputs to standard error.",
  "flows": "Function decorators call warnings.warn() based on configuration settings; the decorators modify functions to include warnings and documentation notes.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. The code uses standard Python warning mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines warnings for deprecated and experimental features, injecting notes into docstrings and displaying warnings when decorated functions are called. The use of warnings and string manipulation appears straightforward. No obfuscated or malicious behavior is present. The code relies on standard Python modules and AWS-related configuration, with no external or suspicious network activity or data handling.\n\nNo malicious activity or security risks are detected. The code's purpose is purely informational and documentation-related, with no data leaks or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily serving to issue warnings and modify documentation for deprecated or experimental APIs. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security threats in this code.",
