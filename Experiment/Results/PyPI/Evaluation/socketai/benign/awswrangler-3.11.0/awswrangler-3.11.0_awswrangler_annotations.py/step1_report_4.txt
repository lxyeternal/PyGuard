{
  "purpose": "The code provides warning and annotation functionalities for an AWS SDK for Pandas module, including deprecation and experimental notices.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration via 'config' and 'warnings.warn' calls; potential user inputs are not directly processed here.",
  "sinks": "Use of 'warnings.warn' could potentially notify users of deprecated or experimental features but does not lead to code execution or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Configuration settings influence whether warnings are suppressed; warning messages are constructed and emitted based on function calls.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Functions are straightforward and primarily for user notifications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines warning classes and decorators to add warnings and notes to functions. The '_inject_note' function modifies docstrings, and 'warn_message' decorates functions to emit warnings conditionally based on configuration. No external data sources, no execution of untrusted code, no suspicious network or file operations. It is designed for user notifications only, with no malicious intent apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for managing warnings and annotations in a Python SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It primarily serves as documentation and user notification infrastructure.",
