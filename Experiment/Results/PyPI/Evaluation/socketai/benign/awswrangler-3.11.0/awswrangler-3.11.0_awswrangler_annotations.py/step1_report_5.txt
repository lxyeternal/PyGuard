{
  "purpose": "This module provides warning decorators and related functions for handling deprecation and experimental notices in a Python SDK, specifically for AWS SDK for Pandas.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from awswrangler._config and accesses function metadata (docstrings and function names).",
  "sinks": "Warnings are issued via warnings.warn, and string manipulations are performed on function docstrings for documentation purposes.",
  "flows": "The decorator functions invoke warnings.warn with message strings, which are generated based on function metadata, and optionally modify docstrings with warning notes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code primarily performs standard warning decorations and string insertions. No obfuscated code, external network activity, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines warning classes for deprecation and experimental notices, utility functions for inserting warning notes into documentation, and a decorator factory that wraps functions to emit warnings when called. It retrieves configuration settings and function metadata, modifies docstrings to include warnings, and applies warnings at runtime if not suppressed. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python patterns for warnings and decorators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of warning decorators for documentation and user notifications. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is negligible.",
