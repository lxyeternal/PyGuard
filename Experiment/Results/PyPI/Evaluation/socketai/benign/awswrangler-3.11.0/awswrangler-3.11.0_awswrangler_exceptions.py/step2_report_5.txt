  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code contains only class definitions for custom exceptions with descriptive docstrings.\n   - No executable logic, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behaviors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is solely a set of exception class definitions.\n   - They correctly conclude that there are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the analysis.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable considering the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions with no runtime behavior, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The reports correctly assign low risk, malware, and obfuscated scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - No malicious activity or code is present; the malware score of 0 is justified.\n   - The exception classes do not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the absence of executable code and external interactions.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - All reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The scores align with the analysis provided.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions. It poses no security, malware, or obfuscation concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores; no adjustments needed.",
