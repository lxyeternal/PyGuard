  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - Each class has a descriptive docstring.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The purpose is clearly to serve as a structured error handling module within a larger application.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - Since these are just class definitions, they cannot execute malicious code.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation or hidden logic.\n   - No network activity, data leaks, or external interactions are involved.\n   - The code does not perform any operations beyond defining exception classes.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (e.g., 0.5), which aligns with the absence of any security concerns.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n   - No issues are present in the code or the reasoning of the reports.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n5. **Any discrepancies or unreasonable scores?**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content.\n   - No need to adjust the scores; they correctly reflect the benign nature.\n\n6. **Additional considerations:**\n   - Since these exception classes are meant for error handling, their presence in a larger codebase is normal.\n   - No hidden malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese scores are justified based on the code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious elements.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis code is a benign, standard set of custom exception class definitions used for structured error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as such.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No changes are recommended to the scores or the analysis.",
