  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for centralized error handling in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for various exception types, with no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from source to sink, as this code only declares exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of standard class declarations inheriting from Exception.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple custom exception class definitions, all straightforward and only inheriting from the built-in Exception class with descriptive docstrings. There are no dynamic executions, external data inputs, or suspicious code constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to serve as a standard error handling module. It is highly unlikely to be malicious or to contain sabotage. The absence of external calls or complex logic further indicates normal behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign collection of custom exception classes intended for structured error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It is a typical pattern for exception management in Python projects.",
