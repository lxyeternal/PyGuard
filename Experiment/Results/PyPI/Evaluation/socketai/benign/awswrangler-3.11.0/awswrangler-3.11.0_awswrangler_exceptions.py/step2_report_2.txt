  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports identify that the code is solely a set of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, external interactions, or obfuscation is present.\n- The purpose is clearly for structured error handling within larger systems.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.\n- The code is standard practice in Python projects.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), consistent with the analysis.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or inconsistencies are noted.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- The only aspect worth noting is that exception class definitions are static and harmless, which all reports agree upon.\n- No evidence suggests any hidden malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk:** Given the benign nature, a score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n- The code poses no security or malware risks; it is a typical exception class module.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
