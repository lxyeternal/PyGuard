{
  "purpose": "Define a centralized module for custom exception classes related to various error conditions in a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for custom exceptions; no external data inputs or data reads.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; purely class declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow between sources and sinks; no runtime data processing or dynamic execution observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code consists solely of exception class definitions, which are standard in Python for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward collection of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. It contains no dynamic code, no input/output operations, no obfuscated code, and no logic beyond class declarations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data theft, or sabotage mechanisms. All classes serve as semantic identifiers for specific error conditions. The absence of executable code or external interactions indicates low risk of malicious activity. The code appears to be a standard, benign exception module intended for use in a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign collection of custom exception classes with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves a structural purpose within a larger project without any suspicious or harmful elements.",
