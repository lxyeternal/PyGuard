{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes for error handling in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "The code contains class definitions for various exception types, which are typically used as sources for error conditions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no data outputs, network connections, or system modifications in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows, input/output operations, or untrusted data handling within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "The code exclusively contains exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings. No code execution, data handling, or suspicious logic is present.",
  "analysis": "This code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, used for error handling in larger systems. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The exception classes are standard practice and do not introduce any security concerns or malicious behavior. No hidden code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected. Since these are merely class declarations with no executable logic, they pose no malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a structured way to handle errors within a larger application. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The structure and content are consistent with standard exception class definitions in Python.",
