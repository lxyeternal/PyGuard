  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Nature**:\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, each inheriting from Python's `Exception` class.\n   - All classes have descriptive docstrings.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external calls, or dynamic logic.\n   - The code appears to be a standard exception module used for structured error handling in a larger application.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or backdoors.\n   - No suspicious patterns or code that could be exploited.\n   - The code is static, purely declarative, and aligns with common Python practices.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0 or very low (0.0 or 0.1). Given the absence of executable or external code, this is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and serve as a standard exception module.\n   - No logical flaws, security concerns, or anomalies are present.\n   - The reasoning in the reports is consistent and justified.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Recommendations**:\n   - The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n   - No need for adjustments; the reports are accurate.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.\n   - The exception classes are typical for error handling in complex systems.\n\n**Final Summary**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is a benign, well-structured exception module with no security risks or malicious behavior.",
