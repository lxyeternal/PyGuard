{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of custom exception classes for error handling within a larger Python project, specifically related to data processing, database operations, and cloud services.",
  "sources": "The code sources data or input indirectly through the raising and catching of exceptions related to external systems (e.g., databases, cloud services). No explicit data input sources are present in the code itself.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising mechanisms serve as sinks where untrusted or error-prone data can influence control flow; however, no direct data leaks or external data transmissions are evident.",
  "flows": "The flow involves external system errors or invalid states raising these exceptions; there are no data flows from sources to sinks within this code as it is solely a declaration of exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely a collection of exception class definitions with no apparent anomalies, obfuscation, or hidden code. No hardcoded credentials, malicious behavior, or suspicious logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple custom exception classes intended to handle specific error scenarios in data, database, and cloud services. The classes are straightforward, inheriting from Python's base Exception class, and only contain docstrings. No code executes dynamically, no data is processed or transmitted, and there are no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The purpose is purely structural, for error handling, with no apparent security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of custom exception definitions used for structured error handling within a larger application. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. It appears to be standard, clean, and safe code.",
