{
  "purpose": "The code defines a comprehensive set of custom exception classes for structured error handling within a larger application or system.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception, with descriptive docstrings, no external data input or output.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, external calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, as the code only declares exception classes without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class declarations with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, each with a descriptive docstring. There are no functions, data processing, external interactions, or dynamic behaviors. The classes serve as semantic identifiers for specific error conditions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The code is standard practice for error handling modules in Python projects. The scores assigned in the reports (malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, risk score 0) are appropriate and justified given the benign and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of custom exception class definitions used for structured error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are accurate and should remain as such.",
