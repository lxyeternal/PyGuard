  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Overview:**\nThe provided code is a collection of custom exception class definitions in Python, each with descriptive docstrings. There are no functions, data processing, external interactions, or executable logic—only class declarations inheriting from `Exception`. The classes serve as semantic identifiers for specific error conditions in a larger application.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code contains only class definitions with no executable or malicious logic.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None. The code is purely structural.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risks:** None evident; standard pattern for error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n#### **Report 1-3 & 5:**\n- **Summary:** These reports correctly identify that the code is solely class definitions for exceptions, with no suspicious or malicious elements.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Accurate; the code is benign, standard, and free of anomalies.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 — appropriate.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — appropriate.\n  - **SecurityRisk:** 0 — appropriate.\n  - **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- Adds some context about the exceptions being related to data processing, database operations, and cloud services. Still, it emphasizes that these are just class definitions with no external data handling or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Any issues or risks?** No. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic or external interactions.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?** No, as the code does not process data, connect to networks, or execute logic beyond class declarations.\n- **Any anomalies or suspicious patterns?** No, all reports correctly identify the code as standard exception classes.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The **malware score** remains **0** because there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- The **obfuscated score** remains **0** because the code is transparent and straightforward.\n- The **risk score** should be **0** because the code poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & My Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The reports are consistent and accurate; no adjustments are necessary. The code is a benign, standard exception module with no security concerns.",
