  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error conditions in a system.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs; the code solely defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow as there are only class definitions without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists only of class definitions with docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively contains definitions of custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with descriptive docstrings. There are no runtime behaviors, data processing, or external interactions. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The code serves a straightforward purpose of exception handling without any malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for error handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It appears safe and intentional for error management purposes.",
