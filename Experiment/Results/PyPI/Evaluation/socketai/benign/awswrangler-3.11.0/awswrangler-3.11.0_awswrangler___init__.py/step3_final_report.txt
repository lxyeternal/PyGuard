  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization script for awswrangler, importing modules, setting up logging, registering engine components, and defining exports.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, configuration, and registration functions; no untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no untrusted data handling or network communication.",
  "flows": "N/A – static imports and setup without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup module performing imports, logging configuration, engine registration, and defining exports. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned by all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified given the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports accurately assess its safety, and the scores are appropriate.",
