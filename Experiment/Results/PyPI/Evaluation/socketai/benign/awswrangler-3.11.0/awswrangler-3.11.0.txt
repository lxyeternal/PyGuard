      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure utility for AWS EMR Serverless management. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified, mainly reflecting potential misuse if parameters are maliciously crafted, but no actual vulnerabilities are present."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration and dispatch framework for distributed engines and memory formats. It uses environment variables, dynamic imports, and reloads, which are common in such systems. No malicious activity or supply chain sabotage is evident. The potential risks are mainly related to external dependencies and environment control, which should be managed securely. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.2-0.3) is appropriate given the context."
