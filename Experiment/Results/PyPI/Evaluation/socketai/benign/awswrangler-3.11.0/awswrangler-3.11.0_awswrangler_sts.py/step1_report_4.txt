  "purpose": "Provide functions to retrieve AWS account and identity information using boto3 sessions.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the boto3 session object via AWS STS client calls.",
  "sinks": "The output values are returned as strings; no direct sinks for untrusted data are evident.",
  "flows": "Boto3 session data flows into AWS STS client methods, which then return account/ARN information to the caller.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed. The code employs standard AWS SDK usage with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, utilizes boto3 sessions to interact with AWS STS, and fetches identity information securely. Functions are straightforward, calling boto3 client methods to obtain account ID, ARN, and parsed name. No external input handling, data leakage, or suspicious behaviors are present. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or anomalous code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for retrieving AWS identity info via boto3. It appears safe, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
