{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for retrieving AWS STS (Security Token Service) information such as account ID, current identity ARN, and current identity name using boto3 sessions.",
  "sources": "The functions call _utils.client to create boto3 client sessions and invoke methods like get_caller_identity, which internally use boto3 to access AWS STS endpoints.",
  "sinks": "The get_caller_identity calls are untrusted data sources that return sensitive AWS identity information; these are not directly dangerous but could leak sensitive data if exposed.",
  "flows": "Input: Optional boto3.Session parameter -> Calls to _utils.client to create a session -> Calls to get_caller_identity() -> Return of AWS account info or ARN -> Parsing of ARN for name.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no malicious logic, and no external network activity apart from AWS API calls.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard boto3 and awswrangler utilities to retrieve AWS identity info. It does not include any dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors. Functions accept optional session inputs, which is standard practice. The use of _utils.client suggests reliance on existing safe utilities. No hardcoded secrets or external network connections beyond AWS API calls. No signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior in structure or content.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for AWS identity retrieval with no malicious or maliciously intented behavior. It is safe in the context of supply chain security.",
