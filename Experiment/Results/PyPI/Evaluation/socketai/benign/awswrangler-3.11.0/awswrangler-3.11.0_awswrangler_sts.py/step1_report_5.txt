{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve AWS account ID, current identity ARN, and current identity name using boto3 sessions.",
  "sources": "Reads boto3 session objects, and AWS STS get_caller_identity API responses.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Functions obtain data from boto3 session or AWS STS API, then process and return values without side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. No unusual behaviors or external network communications beyond AWS SDK calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three utility functions that call AWS STS API via boto3 to fetch account details and caller identity. It utilizes a helper module '_utils' for AWS client creation. The functions are straightforward, with no data manipulation beyond simple extraction. The code does not contain dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network connections outside AWS SDK usage. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard AWS SDK utility module for retrieving identity information. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security threats. It appears to be a benign, well-structured helper module.",
