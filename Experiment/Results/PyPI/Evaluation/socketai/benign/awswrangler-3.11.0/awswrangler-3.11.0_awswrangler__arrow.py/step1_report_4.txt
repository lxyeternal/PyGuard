{
  "purpose": "The module provides utility functions for handling Apache Arrow tables and pandas DataFrames, including partition extraction, schema modification, timezone application, and conversion between data formats.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters such as 'path', 'path_root', 'table', and 'df'. It also reads table schema metadata and pandas DataFrame columns.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include modification of pandas DataFrame columns and Arrow table columns, especially when casting or setting columns based on input parameters. No direct untrusted sink appears to send data over a network or write to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters, metadata) into internal functions that modify DataFrames and Arrow tables, such as applying partition info, timezone conversions, or data type casts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code mainly performs data handling and schema adjustments. The timezone conversion uses 'pa.lib.string_to_tzinfo' but does not involve any external or untrusted inputs directly.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manipulates data structures with careful handling of schemas and metadata. It extracts partition info from file paths, modifies Arrow tables and pandas DataFrames, and applies timezones based on metadata. It uses safe functions from pyarrow and pandas. No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious data exfiltration are present. No network connections or system modifications are detected. Functions operate solely on data passed as parameters with local processing. The use of 'json.loads' on schema metadata is safe as it only processes existing metadata; no external input is involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for data handling with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical data processing tasks such as partition extraction, schema adjustments, and timezone application. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
