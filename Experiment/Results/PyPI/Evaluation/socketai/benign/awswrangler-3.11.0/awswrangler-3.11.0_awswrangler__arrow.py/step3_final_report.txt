  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling PyArrow tables and pandas DataFrames, including partition extraction, timezone application, and data conversion.",
  "sources": "Path strings for partition extraction; schema metadata for timezone info; DataFrame and Arrow table data for conversions.",
  "sinks": "None; data is processed internally without external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Path strings → partition extraction; schema metadata → timezone adjustments; DataFrame ↔ Arrow table conversions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data handling tasks using well-known libraries. Functions extract partition info from paths, add columns to Arrow tables, ensure DataFrame mutability, apply timezone conversions based on metadata, and convert between pandas and pyarrow formats. No network activity, code obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The use of json.loads on schema metadata is typical and safe. The risk of exploitation is minimal, mainly related to untrusted inputs, but no active vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and designed for data processing within data pipelines. No malicious intent or security risks are detected. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the analysis.",
