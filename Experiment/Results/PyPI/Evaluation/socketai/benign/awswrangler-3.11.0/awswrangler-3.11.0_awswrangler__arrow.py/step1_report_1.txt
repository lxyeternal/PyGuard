{
  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions for handling Apache Arrow tables and Pandas DataFrames, including partition extraction, timezone application, and data conversion.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from file paths (via _extract_partitions_from_path), DataFrame columns, and table schemas. Metadata is extracted from schema annotations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include appending or setting columns in Arrow tables, modifying DataFrames, and converting data between formats, which could be exploited if untrusted data influences these operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file paths (source) through partition extraction to table modification (sink), from DataFrame to Arrow table conversions (source to sink), and timezone adjustments applied based on metadata (source to sink).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of standard libraries like pyarrow, pandas, and awswrangler is typical. No network operations, cryptomining, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manipulates data structures (DataFrames and Arrow Tables), extracting partitions from paths, applying timezones, and converting formats. It uses standard libraries without suspicious patterns. No network communication, system modifications, or malicious behavior detected. The functions are designed for data handling and do not contain any obfuscated or malicious logic. The only potential concern could be the handling of untrusted metadata or file paths, but these are typical in data processing pipelines. Overall, the code appears to serve legitimate utility purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard utility code for data handling in a data pipeline context. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the current analysis.",
