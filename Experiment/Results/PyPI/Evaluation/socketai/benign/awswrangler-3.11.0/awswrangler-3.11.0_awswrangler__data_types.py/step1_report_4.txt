{
  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions for converting data types between various systems (PyArrow, Athena, Redshift, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Timestream, and Pandas) and for extracting and inferring data types from Pandas DataFrames and schemas.",
  "sources": "Reading data from pandas DataFrames, pandas Index, and PyArrow schemas; parsing strings for type conversions.",
  "sinks": "Type conversions and schema generation functions that output data type strings and PyArrow data types.",
  "flows": "Data is read from DataFrame columns or schemas; type inference functions process these inputs; conversions are performed via string parsing or method calls; results are used for schema definitions or data type mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No untrusted network activity, system modifications, or privacy violations present. Code is primarily utility functions for data type conversions and schema inference.",
  "analysis": "The code provides various functions for converting data types between different systems and for schema inference from pandas DataFrames and PyArrow schemas. All functions perform straightforward data type mapping, string parsing, and schema handling. No network activity, file I/O, or command execution is present. The code relies on safe, standard libraries and performs only data type transformations, with proper error handling for unsupported types. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed. The code appears to be a standard utility module for data type management without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of data type conversion and inference utilities with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles data types and schema conversions safely and transparently. The overall security risk is very low.",
