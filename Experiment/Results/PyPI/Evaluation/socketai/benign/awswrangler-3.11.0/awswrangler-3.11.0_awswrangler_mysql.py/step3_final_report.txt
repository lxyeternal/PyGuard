{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for connecting to, querying, and inserting data into MySQL databases within AWS environments, utilizing secrets management and pandas DataFrames.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as connection info, secrets, SQL strings, DataFrames, and environment variables for secrets and connection details.",
  "sinks": "SQL commands executed via cursor, DataFrames returned from queries, and data inserted into tables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters/secrets into connection setup, then into SQL execution or DataFrame processing, with outputs being query results or database modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; use of identifier() for sanitization is standard but relies on correct implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code employs best practices: connection validation, parameterized queries, transaction management, and secrets handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or network anomalies are present. The use of UUIDs for temp tables and dynamic SQL is standard, assuming proper sanitization via identifier(). The security risk is minimal, with scores around 0.1-0.2, justified by external dependencies and dynamic SQL construction. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero, consistent across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and well-structured utility for AWS-integrated MySQL operations. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage is evident. The slight security risk score reflects minimal potential vulnerabilities that are mitigated by current practices.",
