{
  "purpose": "The code defines various typed dictionaries, data structures, and configurations for data processing and storage in AWS services, primarily focusing on Athena, Glue, Timestream, and S3 integrations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from environment variables, function parameters, and external libraries (e.g., pyarrow).",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications are evident; the code only defines data structures and configurations.",
  "flows": "There are no active data flows or execution paths; the code is purely declarative with type annotations and class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard type definitions for data configurations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of typed dictionary definitions, class annotations, and data structures for configuring AWS services like Athena, Glue, Timestream, and S3. It uses secure and standard practices, referencing external libraries like pyarrow for encryption configurations, with no indication of malicious behavior. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications. It appears to be a standard set of configuration models with no embedded threats or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of configuration data structures with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe for use and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
