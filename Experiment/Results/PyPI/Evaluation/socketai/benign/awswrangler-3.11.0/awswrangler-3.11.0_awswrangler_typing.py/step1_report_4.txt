{
  "purpose": "Define parameter types and configurations for AWS Glue, Athena, Timestream, Arrow, and Ray within a data processing framework.",
  "sources": "Code reads type annotations, class attribute definitions, and imported modules for pyarrow and typing extensions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations; mainly type definitions and configurations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is primarily static type definitions and data structure declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. The code mainly consists of type annotations and structured configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured data types and configuration dictionaries using TypedDict, NamedTuple, and type hints. No runtime code, input handling, or external data processing present that could lead to injection, data leaks, or malicious actions. Usage of pyarrow for encryption configurations is limited to type annotations and documentation references, not active encryption logic. No obfuscation techniques, suspicious code, or malicious behaviors detected. The module serves as a schema or configuration reference for data processing frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of data type definitions and configurations with no active logic or data handling. It appears benign, serving as a schema or configuration module. No malicious intent or security risks identified based on the static code provided.",
