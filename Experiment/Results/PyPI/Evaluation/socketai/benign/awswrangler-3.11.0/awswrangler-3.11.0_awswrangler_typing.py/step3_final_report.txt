{
  "purpose": "Defines static data structures and configuration schemas for AWS Glue, Athena, Timestream, Arrow encryption, Ray, and S3 settings, primarily for data processing workflows.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class attribute definitions, imported modules (pyarrow), and documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is read from or written to external sources at runtime.",
  "flows": "No data flow or runtime data processing; purely declarative definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions, TypedDicts, NamedTuples, and documentation comments. It uses standard libraries like pyarrow for configuration purposes. No executable logic, data handling, or network activity is present. The code's structure and comments indicate it is intended for configuration and schema validation, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, static configuration module defining data schemas for cloud data workflows. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with its nature: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
