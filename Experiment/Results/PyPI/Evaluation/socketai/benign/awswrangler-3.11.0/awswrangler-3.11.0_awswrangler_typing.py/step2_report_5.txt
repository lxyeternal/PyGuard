  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and determine appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines parameter types for AWS Glue, Athena, etc., via static type annotations and TypedDicts.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely declarative, static configuration schemas, with no executable logic or external data flows.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code content. No issues found. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defines configuration schemas for AWS services.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of pyarrow for encryption configs is standard; no secrets or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static schema definitions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—configuration data structures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow, no external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, no obfuscation, standard use of pyarrow.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely declarative, safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines configuration types, no runtime logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No active data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static, benign configuration schemas.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, detailed configuration schemas.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, no obfuscation, use of pyarrow is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static, safe code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Note:** The report assigns a small security risk (0.1) and a slightly less than full confidence, which seems reasonable given the code's nature as configuration schemas. No actual malicious behavior is present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification & Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malware (0). The code is purely declarative with no executable or malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0; the code is straightforward, well-documented, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the static nature, no secrets, and no executable logic, the risk remains minimal (0). The small 0.1 in report 5 might be a conservative estimate, considering the use of cryptography libraries, but since no actual cryptographic operations are performed here, I agree with a very low score.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or at most 0.1 if considering cryptography references, but since no active cryptography occurs here, 0 is appropriate)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a set of static configuration schemas with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, non-malicious, and purely declarative. No further action or concern is necessary.",
