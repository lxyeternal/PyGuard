  "purpose": "Definition of various parameter types and configurations for AWS Glue, Athena, Timestream, Arrow encryption, Ray distributed processing, and S3 data handling.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class attribute definitions, import statements, and default value assignments within TypedDicts and NamedTuple structures.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no code writes data or executes commands based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external untrusted sources to critical sinks; mostly static data structures and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution identified. The code is purely declarative type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured type definitions for configuration parameters used in cloud data workflows involving AWS services and Apache Arrow. It leverages type hints for clarity and correctness but contains no executable logic, input handling, or external data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The use of third-party libraries like pyarrow is standard for encryption and data processing tasks. No anomalies, malicious code, or security risks are evident within this static configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of comprehensive data type definitions for cloud data service configurations. It appears to be legitimate and non-malicious, with no indication of malware or security risks. It solely defines parameter structures used elsewhere in the application.",
