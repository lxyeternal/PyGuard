  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a CDK-based library for Aurora global databases, sourcing data from environment variables, parameters, and external AWS resources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network activity or command execution; data flows into resource configurations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Standard resource definitions, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets except a plaintext password ('1qaz2wsx') which is a security concern but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate infrastructure code, no malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior. The only risk is secret management.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing class definitions and resource setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Potential exposure of sensitive data via environment variables and parameters, but no active malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** No backdoors or obfuscation; plaintext password is a security concern.\n- **Conclusion:** Infrastructure code with standard patterns, no malware, but insecure secret handling.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on class and data structure definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data from environment variables and parameters into resource configurations.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no command execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate infrastructure code, with a note on plaintext password.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar pattern: class definitions, data flow from inputs to resource configuration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or malicious activity; data flows are standard.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of sabotage; plaintext password noted.\n- **Conclusion:** Infrastructure library, no malware, security concern on secret management.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern: resource configuration via class definitions, environment variables, and parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network activity, no command execution.\n- **Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious code; static password is a security risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate multi-region Aurora setup code, no malware.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Presence of malware:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malicious intent:** No network activity, command execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- **Secrets & passwords:** Hardcoded plaintext password ('1qaz2wsx') is insecure but not malicious.\n- **Environment variables:** Usage is standard; potential risk if environment variables are compromised, but no direct malicious activity.\n\n### Scores Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the security concern about plaintext passwords, a moderate risk score of around 0.2-0.3 is appropriate. The overall risk is low because the code is infrastructure configuration, not active malicious code.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Overall malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.2–0.3 (due to plaintext password)  \n\n**Note:** The primary security concern is secret management, not malware or sabotage.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- No evidence of malware, sabotage, or obfuscation.\n- The code is a legitimate AWS CDK infrastructure library.\n- The main security issue is insecure secret handling, which should be addressed in deployment practices.\n\n**Recommendation:** Ensure secrets like passwords are managed via secrets managers or environment variables, not hardcoded.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3",
