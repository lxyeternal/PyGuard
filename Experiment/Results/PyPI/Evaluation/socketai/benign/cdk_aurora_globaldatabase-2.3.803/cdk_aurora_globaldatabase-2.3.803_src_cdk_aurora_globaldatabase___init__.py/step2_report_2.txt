  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code snippets and the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as an AWS CDK construct library for Aurora Global Databases, reading from environment variables, parameters, and external resources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of data leaks or malicious data flow. The data flows into resource configuration, typical for IaC.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets (except a plaintext password '1qaz2wsx'), no obfuscation, no malicious code, backdoors, or network activity. Use of environment variables is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.9). No malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The main concern is plaintext password exposure, which is a common security consideration but not malicious.\n\n**Score Adjustment:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (appropriate, due to plaintext password and environment variable usage)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly states the code defines classes for Aurora global databases, reading environment variables, parameters, and passwords.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into resource configurations, with potential risk if environment variables or parameters are maliciously manipulated.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of hardcoded secrets beyond the plaintext password '1qaz2wsx'. No obfuscation or malicious logic. The code is standard CDK resource setup.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9). No malware or sabotage detected. The plaintext password is a security concern but not malicious.\n\n**Score Adjustment:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (consistent)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description of class-based infrastructure setup, environment variables, and parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network activity or exfiltration; data flows into resource configs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets other than the plaintext password '1qaz2wsx'. No obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (0.95). No signs of malware or sabotage.\n\n**Score Adjustment:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (due to plaintext password)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code defines classes for Aurora global databases, with standard parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or data exfiltration observed.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code; the only concern is the plaintext password '1qaz2wsx'.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9). No malware or sabotage.\n\n**Score Adjustment:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others, class-based resource definitions, environment variables, and static password.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network activity; data flows into resource configuration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Presence of hardcoded password '1qaz2wsx' is a security concern but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9). No malware or sabotage.\n\n**Score Adjustment:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.3 (slightly higher due to the static password, but still not malicious)\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No evidence of malicious payloads, command execution, network exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation or hidden code detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated due to plaintext passwords and environment variable handling, but not indicating malicious intent.\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The static password '1qaz2wsx' is a security concern and should be replaced with secure secret management practices.\n- No malware, sabotage, or obfuscation detected in the code.\n- The code appears to be legitimate infrastructure-as-code for managing AWS Aurora global databases.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3 (due to plaintext password and environment variables, but no malicious activity)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, legitimate AWS CDK library for Aurora global databases. The only security note is the plaintext password, which should be handled securely, but no malicious or sabotage activity is evident.",
