  "purpose": "To load package metadata from a static JSON string, read the README.md file for long description, and invoke setuptools.setup() to prepare the Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "The static JSON string containing package metadata, the file read operation on README.md",
  "sinks": "The call to setuptools.setup() with the assembled kwargs",
  "flows": "JSON data and README.md content are used as arguments in setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated code, no embedded secrets or credentials",
  "analysis": "The code loads static package metadata from a JSON string, reads a README.md file for the long description, and calls setuptools.setup() with these parameters. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution. The JSON data appears to be standard package info, and the file I/O is typical for setup scripts. No network activity, secrets, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup script with static metadata and no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with appropriate scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.",
