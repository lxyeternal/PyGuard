{
  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata and configuration for a Python project, preparing it for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "json.loads() parsing the package metadata, reading the README.md file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() invocation which consumes all provided metadata for package distribution.",
  "flows": "json.loads() parses metadata from string to dictionary, then the dictionary is passed to setuptools.setup(), which processes the package info and reads README.md for description.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses json.loads() on a static string, which is generally safe, and reads a README.md file without sanitization, but neither is suspicious or unusual in typical package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package metadata from a hardcoded JSON string, reads the README.md file for detailed description, and calls setuptools.setup() with this information to prepare the package for distribution. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. No dynamic or untrusted input handling, no suspicious file access, and no embedded code execution are present. The process is straightforward and aligns with typical package release workflows.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no indicators of sabotage or malware. It is a legitimate package configuration script.",
