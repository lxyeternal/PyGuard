{
  "purpose": "This code extends the module namespace, performs version-dependent type checking, loads a JSII assembly for AWS CDK integration, and publishes the package. It facilitates package setup and runtime configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads include version retrieval via importlib.metadata, internal jsii attributes, and the assembly load parameters; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The assembly load and publication functions are sinks; no untrusted data flows or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Version info and internal jsii attributes flow into assembly loading; assembly load and publication are executed without external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal jsii attributes (`jsii._reference_map.InterfaceDynamicProxy`) is unconventional but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks typical for AWS CDK/JSII modules, including namespace extension, version-dependent typeguard configuration, dynamic assembly loading, and publishing. No malicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or network activities are detected. The internal jsii attribute usage is unconventional but consistent with dynamic SDKs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low risk ~0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard package initialization script for an AWS CDK-related library. It contains no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain sabotage. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal risk reflects typical SDK setup routines.",
