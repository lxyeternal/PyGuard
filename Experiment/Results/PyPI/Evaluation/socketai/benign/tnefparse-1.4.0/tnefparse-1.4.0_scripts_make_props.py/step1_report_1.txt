  "purpose": "Generate a Python module with property mappings based on a text data file for use in TNEF parsing.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'data/properties.txt' file to extract property names and values.",
  "sinks": "Writes to 'tnefparse/properties.py' file, generating Python code with property definitions and a dictionary.",
  "flows": "Reads property data from file -> Processes and sorts data -> Writes Python code with property definitions and mapping.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward data processing and code generation with no suspicious or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a text file containing property mappings, filters out comments/empty lines, splits each line into name and value, sorts the properties by value, and writes a Python file that defines constants and a dictionary. No user input is processed, no network or system calls are made, and no dynamic code execution occurs. The purpose appears to be static code generation for property constants. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign script for generating property mapping modules. It does not contain malware, suspicious activity, or security risks.",
