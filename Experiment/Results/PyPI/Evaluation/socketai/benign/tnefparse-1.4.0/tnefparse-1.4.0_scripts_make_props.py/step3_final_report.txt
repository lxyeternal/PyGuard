{
  "purpose": "The script reads property name-value pairs from 'data/properties.txt', filters out comments and blank lines, sorts the properties by their numeric value, and generates a Python module 'properties.py' defining constants and a mapping dictionary for use in TNEF parsing.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'data/properties.txt' file, processes its lines, and writes to 'tnefparse/properties.py'.",
  "sinks": "Writes generated Python code to a file; no runtime data leaks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Reads data from 'properties.txt' -> processes and sorts data -> writes constants and mapping to 'properties.py'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple file reading, string filtering, splitting, sorting, and code generation. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The script's purpose is static code generation for property constants. The input file may contain malicious data, but the script itself does not execute or evaluate input beyond processing text. All security and malware scores are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code. No logical errors or suspicious patterns are present. The documentation and comments support maintainability and clarity. The code is deterministic and safe, with high confidence in its benignity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured utility for generating property constants from a local data file. It poses no security risks, contains no malware or obfuscation, and performs a straightforward task. All reports correctly assess its harmless nature, and no modifications to the scores are necessary.",
