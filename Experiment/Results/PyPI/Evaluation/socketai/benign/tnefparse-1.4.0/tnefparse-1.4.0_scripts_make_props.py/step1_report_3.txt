{
  "purpose": "To generate a Python module containing property name-to-value mappings for use in TNEF parsing.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'data/properties.txt' file to extract property mappings.",
  "sinks": "Writes to 'tnefparse/properties.py' file to create the properties module.",
  "flows": "Reads text data from properties.txt -> Parses and sorts property entries -> Writes Python code with mappings and documentation -> Saves to properties.py",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no external network activity. The code primarily reads and writes files, performs straightforward parsing and sorting.",
  "analysis": "The script processes a text file containing property mappings, sorts them, and generates a Python source file defining constants and a dictionary for property lookup. The process is standard for code generation and does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs. It does not involve user input, network activity, or data handling beyond local files. The comments and formatting indicate a focus on documentation and maintainability. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility script for regenerating property mappings for a larger application. It performs standard file reading, data parsing, sorting, and code generation without any malicious intent or behavior.",
