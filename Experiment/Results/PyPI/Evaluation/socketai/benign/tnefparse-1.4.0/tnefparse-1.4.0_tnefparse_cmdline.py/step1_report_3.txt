  "purpose": "Command-line utility for extracting and inspecting TNEF file contents, including attachments, body, and properties.",
  "sources": "Reads TNEF files provided via command-line arguments; reads file contents with tfp.read().",
  "sinks": "Writes attachments to filesystem; outputs text and JSON to stdout; writes status messages to stderr.",
  "flows": "Reads file data (source) -> parses into TNEF object -> extracts data based on flags -> outputs or writes to disk.",
  "anomalies": "Uses tfp.read() directly on file objects without validation; no evident hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments to process TNEF files, extracting attachments, properties, or body content. It reads files with tfp.read() and writes outputs or files accordingly. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are present; the code functions as a typical file processing utility. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated constructs are observed. The code relies on external libraries and standard Python modules, with no indications of malicious intent. It handles user input securely at the command-line level without evident injection vulnerabilities. The logging is configurable and used for warnings, but no dangerous operations are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard TNEF file processing utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration. The security risk is minimal, and the code does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious anomalies.",
