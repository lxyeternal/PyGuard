  "purpose": "Command-line utility for extracting and processing TNEF email file contents, including attachments and various email bodies.",
  "sources": "Reads TNEF files provided via command-line arguments, reads attachment data, reads email body contents, reads properties and object lists from TNEF structure.",
  "sinks": "Writes attachments to specified directory, writes zip file if requested, writes email bodies to stdout, outputs JSON dump of TNEF contents, logs warnings, and outputs to stderr.",
  "flows": "Reads TNEF file data -> parses it into TNEF object -> processes user options -> outputs data to files, stdout, or JSON depending on options.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious obfuscated code, no unusual behavior observed. The code handles files securely via argparse and Path, no evident misuse of inputs.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard libraries for argument parsing and file handling. It loads TNEF files, extracts various parts (attachments, bodies, properties). All data inputs are from files specified by the user, and outputs are written to files or stdout. No dynamic code execution or network activity is present. The code operates within typical bounds of a file processing utility. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors like data exfiltration, backdoors, or system manipulation observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for processing TNEF files with no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions as expected for a command-line tool with safe handling of files and data.",
