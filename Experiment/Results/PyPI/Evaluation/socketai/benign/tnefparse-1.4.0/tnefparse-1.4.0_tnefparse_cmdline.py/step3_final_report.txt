  "purpose": "A command-line utility to extract and analyze TNEF file contents, including attachments, bodies, properties, and providing overviews or dumps.",
  "sources": "File inputs via argparse.FileType('rb'), reading TNEF data with TNEF(tfp.read()).",
  "sinks": "Writing attachments, zip files, JSON dumps, and bodies to disk or stdout based on user options.",
  "flows": "Read file -> parse with TNEF -> extract data -> output to user-specified destinations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard utility that processes TNEF files for extraction and inspection. It uses common libraries, handles errors appropriately, and performs expected file operations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2) are justified given the code's functionality and lack of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign TNEF processing tool with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects the inherent risk of processing untrusted files, which is typical for such utilities. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. No modifications to the scores or conclusions are necessary.",
