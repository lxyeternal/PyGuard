  "purpose": "Command-line tool for extracting and analyzing contents of TNEF files, including attachments, body parts, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads TNEF file data from file objects opened via argparse.FileType('rb')",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout or writes files to specified paths, potential data leaks if untrusted files are processed",
  "flows": "Reads file data -> Processes TNEF content -> Outputs attachments, bodies, or dumps JSON to stdout or files",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious domain connections or system modifications; uses standard library functions only",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward command-line interface for processing TNEF files. It reads file inputs, parses them into TNEF objects, and optionally outputs metadata, attachments, or bodies. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. There are no network connections, no data exfiltration, and no malicious code patterns such as reverse shells, system modification, or code injection. Error handling is limited to value errors during TNEF parsing. The script writes files based on user inputs, which could be misused if untrusted files are processed, but this is typical functionality for a file processing tool. Overall, the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard TNEF extraction utility without any malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It reads input files, processes them, and writes output data. There are no indicators of malware, suspicious network activity, or malicious logic. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to processing untrusted files, which is inherent to such tools but not malicious by design.",
