  "purpose": "Static mapping between MAPI property codes and names.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions and a dictionary mapping property codes to names.",
  "sinks": "None; static data with no external data handling.",
  "flows": "Static, no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; purely static data, no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions and a mapping dictionary for MAPI properties. There is no dynamic code, no external interactions, no obfuscation, and no signs of malicious behavior. The purpose is to serve as a reference table for property IDs and names. The static nature and lack of runtime data flow confirm its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static reference for MAPI property constants and mappings, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.",
