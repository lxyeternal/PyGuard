{
  "purpose": "The code defines constants for MAPI property tags and a mapping from property codes to property names, likely used for email client or server integration with Microsoft Outlook or Exchange.",
  "sources": "The source consists of constant definitions for property tags and a dictionary mapping property codes to string names, which are static data declarations.",
  "sinks": "There are no dynamic data sinks, user input, or external data processing functions present in this code.",
  "flows": "The flow is static, from the definitions of constants to a dictionary mapping, with no runtime data flow or user interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code solely contains static definitions and mappings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists purely of static constant declarations for various MAPI property tags, along with a dictionary that maps these constant values to descriptive string names. There is no code execution, data processing, or external interaction. The definitions appear to be standard and consistent with known MAPI property IDs and names. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage is found. The purpose appears to be to facilitate property lookups or mapping within a larger email or messaging application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward static mapping of MAPI property IDs to names and contains no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is a benign, static data declaration module used for referencing property tags.",
