{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of constant mappings for MAPI property tags and their corresponding string names, likely intended for use in handling Outlook or Exchange messaging data.",
  "sources": "Constants declaration (MAPI_*), dictionary CODE_TO_NAME mapping",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present; the code only declares static mappings",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; static definitions without runtime data manipulation",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward constant definitions and a mapping dictionary.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, consisting of constant definitions and a dictionary mapping property IDs to property names. No input/output, no code injection, no external data handling, no malicious behavior. It appears to be a utility module for referencing MAPI properties.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. It is a static property mapping used for referencing MAPI property tags. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
