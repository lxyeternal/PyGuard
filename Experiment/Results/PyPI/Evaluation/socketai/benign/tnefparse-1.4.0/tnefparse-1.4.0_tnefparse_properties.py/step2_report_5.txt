  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issues present in code?** No. The code is static constant definitions and a mapping dictionary.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None. The reasoning correctly identifies the code as static data.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0. These are reasonable given the static nature.  \n- **Justification for scores > 0.5?** Not applicable.  \n- **Overall:** Accurate, no concerns.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issues present in code?** No. Static constants and a mapping.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None. The analysis correctly notes the absence of dynamic or malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0. Appropriate.  \n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issues present in code?** No. Static constants and mapping.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None. The reasoning aligns with the static, benign nature.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0. Reasonable.  \n- **Overall:** Sound.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issues present in code?** No. Static definitions and mapping.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None. The analysis is consistent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0. Appropriate.  \n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issues present in code?** No. Constant definitions and static mapping.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None. The assessment is thorough and accurate.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0. Reasonable.  \n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is purely static data definitions: constants and a mapping dictionary for MAPI property IDs and names. There is no dynamic code, no data processing, no external interactions, and no obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — consistent with the static, benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk, as the code is just static reference data.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues in this static mapping code.",
