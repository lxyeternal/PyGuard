{
  "purpose": "Defines mappings between MAPI property codes and their names, likely used for email or messaging applications.",
  "sources": "The constant definitions and the CODE_TO_NAME dictionary, which map property codes to string names.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process or output untrusted data. No network, file, or environment interaction observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external inputs; the code is static data definition only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; all code consists of static constant definitions and a dictionary. No dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a set of constant definitions for MAPI property codes and a mapping dictionary. It contains no functions, data processing, or external interactions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The code serves as a lookup/reference table for MAPI properties, which is common in email client implementations or messaging systems.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward static data mapping with no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or malicious behavior. It appears to be a utility or reference data used for mapping property IDs to names in messaging contexts.",
