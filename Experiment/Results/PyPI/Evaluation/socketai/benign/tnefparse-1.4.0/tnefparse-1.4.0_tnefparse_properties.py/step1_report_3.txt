{
  "purpose": "Define constants for MAPI property tags and a mapping from property codes to names, likely for email or messaging system integration.",
  "sources": "Constants definitions for property tags and the CODE_TO_NAME dictionary mapping numeric property codes to descriptive string names.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code only sets up static mappings and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative, establishing static mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are evident. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of numeric constant definitions representing property tags, along with a dictionary mapping these constants to human-readable strings. All values are static, hardcoded numeric and string literals. No functions, input/output, or dynamic behaviors are present. The purpose appears to be defining a property namespace for MAPI properties used in messaging applications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The structure is clear, and the code serves as a static lookup table.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static set of constants and a mapping dictionary for MAPI properties, with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward, legitimate data structure setup for email/message property handling.",
