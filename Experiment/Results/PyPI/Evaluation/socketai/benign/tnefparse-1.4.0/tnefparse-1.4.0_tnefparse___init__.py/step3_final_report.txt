  "purpose": "Setup logging with NullHandler and import classes from local .tnef module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .tnef module, logging.getLogger(__package__).addHandler(logging.NullHandler())",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no external data handling, no network or file I/O",
  "flows": "Import statements and logging setup, no data flow or external communication",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and logging configuration, no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code only imports classes from a local module and configures logging with a NullHandler. There are no data flows, user inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code is standard for package initialization and contains no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign package setup snippet with no malicious intent or security issues. The existing scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
