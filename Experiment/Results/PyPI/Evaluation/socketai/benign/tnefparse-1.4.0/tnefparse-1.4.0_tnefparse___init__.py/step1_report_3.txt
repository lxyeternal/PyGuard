  "purpose": "Setup logging configuration and import TNEF-related classes from the local package.",
  "sources": "Import statement for TNEF, TNEFAttachment, TNEFObject from local package; reading of __package__ variable for logger configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no user input or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports and logging configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of __package__ for logger setup is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from a local module, which is common for modular Python projects. It configures the logger for the package by adding a NullHandler, preventing logging errors if no other handlers are configured. There are no signs of malicious activity, external data processing, or obfuscation. The code appears to be routine package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and standard for Python package initialization, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
