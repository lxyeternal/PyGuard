  "purpose": "Decodes MAPI attribute data from binary format into Python objects, handling various data types, multi-value properties, and GUIDs.",
  "sources": "Reads byte sequences for property count, property types, property names, GUIDs, multi-value counts, and property data segments.",
  "sinks": "Creates instances of TNEFMAPI_Attribute with parsed data; no external system interactions or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Byte data flows from the input into parsing functions, which interpret and convert segments into attribute objects, then stored in a list.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Logging is standard for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward parser for MAPI properties, correctly handling data types, multi-value properties, and encodings. It uses standard decoding functions, exception handling, and logging. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The external utility functions are presumed safe. The data flow is limited to data decoding without external effects. The scores assigned in the original reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and risk profile.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured MAPI attribute decoder with no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
