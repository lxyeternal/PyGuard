{
  "purpose": "Defines and decodes MAPI attribute types from binary data, supporting parsing and representation of various property types used in MAPI-based systems.",
  "sources": "Reads binary data buffers in decode_mapi() and parse_property(), and input parameters such as data buffers and offsets.",
  "sinks": "Decodes data into Python objects and strings, with no direct writing or network transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Data is read from binary buffers in decode_mapi() -> parse_property() and converted into attribute objects with properties, but no external data sinks like network or file output are directly present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The use of exception handling in decode_mapi() is standard. No obfuscation detected. Logging is used for debugging, which is typical for such modules.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to decode MAPI properties from binary data, converting raw bytes into typed Python objects, primarily for property inspection. It handles multi-value properties, GUIDs, and various data types per MAPI specs. The attribute class offers formatted access to data. No evidence of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The code relies on external utilities for data conversion, but these are not included here; assuming they are standard or benign. Exception handling is for robustness, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate MAPI data decoder with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions to parse and represent MAPI property data safely, with no suspicious behaviors or malware signals.",
