{
  "purpose": "Defines functions and classes for decoding and handling MAPI attribute data types in a structured manner.",
  "sources": "Data read from the input 'data' parameter in decode_mapi and parse_property functions, especially from byte streams representing properties.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed into Python data types or decoded strings, but no external system or network interactions are present; potential risk if data is maliciously crafted to exploit decoding logic.",
  "flows": "Data is read from byte streams (source), interpreted based on type, and converted into Python objects or strings (sink), via decode_mapi and parse_property functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The code relies on standard decoding routines. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or external malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for decoding MAPI property data, handling various data types securely. It includes error handling and logging. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The functions parse input data according to known MAPI specifications, with proper exception handling and data decoding. There are no dynamically executed code segments, no suspicious external dependencies used in a malicious context, and no hardcoded secrets. The overall structure is typical for data parsing modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data parsing module for MAPI attributes with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It processes input data into meaningful Python objects safely. There are no indicators of malware or security risks within this module.",
