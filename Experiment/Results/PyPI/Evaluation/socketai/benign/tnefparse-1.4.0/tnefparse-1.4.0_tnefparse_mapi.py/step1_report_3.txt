  "purpose": "Defines functions and classes for decoding and representing MAPI attribute data from binary format, primarily for parsing email or contact data in Outlook-like systems.",
  "sources": "Reads binary data input in decode_mapi and parse_property functions, especially data passed into these functions for decoding MAPI properties.",
  "sinks": "Processes data in decode_mapi and parse_property; ultimately converts raw bytes into Python objects or strings, but no data is sent over network, written to files, or executed as code.",
  "flows": "Data is read from binary input in decode_mapi and parse_property, transformed into Python data types within the TNEFMAPI_Attribute class, and returned as structured attribute objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors identified. Logging is used for debugging, which is standard. No obfuscated or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs structured parsing of binary MAPI attribute data, with careful handling of different data types and multi-valued properties. It uses standard decoding techniques and data conversions. No network calls, file modifications, or code execution are present. The logging statements are for diagnostics and do not pose security risks. No evidence of supply chain sabotage, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured parser for MAPI attribute data, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply decodes binary data into Python objects for further use. The likelihood of malware or supply chain attacks is very low.",
