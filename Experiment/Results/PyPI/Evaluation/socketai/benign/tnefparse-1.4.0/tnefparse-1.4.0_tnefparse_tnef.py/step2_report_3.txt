  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scoring consistency, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim:** No malicious activity, no backdoors, code is legitimate.\n- **Evidence:** The code is a parser for TNEF data, extracting message and attachment properties, with optional RTF decompression.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign, with no suspicious behaviors.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable. The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim:** Same as above, focusing on safe decoding, no malicious behaviors.\n- **Evidence:** No dynamic code execution, no network activity, only decoding and archiving.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate parser, safe for processing untrusted data as long as the input is validated externally.\n\n**Verdict:** The evaluation is sound. No issues identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim:** Similar to previous, emphasizing safe decoding, no malicious actions.\n- **Evidence:** No execution of untrusted code, no network, no backdoors.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, matching the reasoning.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The parser is benign, with standard handling of email data.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim:** Functions as a standard TNEF parser, no malicious behaviors.\n- **Evidence:** No embedded malicious code, no backdoors, no suspicious data flows.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** The review aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim:** Same as others, emphasizing safe data handling and no malicious activity.\n- **Evidence:** No network, no code execution, no backdoors, only data parsing and archiving.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears safe and benign.\n\n**Verdict:** The evaluation is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking Scores and Justifications:\n\n- All reports assign **malware** and **obfuscated** scores of 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n- The **security risk** scores are low (~0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the code's limited attack surface—mainly data parsing, no execution of untrusted code, no network activity.\n- The only minor point is the optional import of 'compressed_rtf', which is benign and handled gracefully.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear, structured, and well-documented.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — Very low, considering the code processes potentially untrusted data but does not perform dangerous operations.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are consistent and justified. The code is a legitimate, well-structured parser for TNEF email data, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a safe, transparent, and standard implementation for email TNEF data processing.",
