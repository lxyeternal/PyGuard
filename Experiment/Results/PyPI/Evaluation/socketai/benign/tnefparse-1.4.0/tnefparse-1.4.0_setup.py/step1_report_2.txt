  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the tnefparse Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files, and defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no user input or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static configuration for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, sets version and package metadata, reads description files, and configures packaging parameters. It contains no dynamic code execution, external data handling beyond reading static files, or suspicious logic. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python packaging script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs typical setup operations for a Python package without any security concerns.",
