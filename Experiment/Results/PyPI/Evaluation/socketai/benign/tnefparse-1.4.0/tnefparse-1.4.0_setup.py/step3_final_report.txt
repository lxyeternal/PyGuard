{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup.py script used for packaging the Python library 'tnefparse'. It defines package metadata, reads static description files, and configures package settings without executing any dynamic or external code.",
  "sources": "Reading static files ('README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst') for long description; static import statements; static parameters in setup()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed; no data leaks or code execution points",
  "flows": "Static file reads for description → setup() configuration with static data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script that imports standard libraries, reads fixed documentation files, and calls setup() with predefined parameters. It does not process untrusted data, execute code dynamically, or perform network operations. All indicators point to a benign, well-structured packaging script. The reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign appropriate scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. No issues or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python packaging script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
