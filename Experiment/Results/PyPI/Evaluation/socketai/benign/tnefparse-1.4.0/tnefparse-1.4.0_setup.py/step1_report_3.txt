  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is being processed or executed",
  "flows": "File content read from README.rst and HISTORY.rst to populate long_description in setup",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; standard setup script",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines version, and calls setup() with project metadata. It reads package descriptions from files, sets classifiers, author info, dependencies, and entry points. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. The code strictly performs packaging setup without any embedded malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is solely used for package configuration.",
