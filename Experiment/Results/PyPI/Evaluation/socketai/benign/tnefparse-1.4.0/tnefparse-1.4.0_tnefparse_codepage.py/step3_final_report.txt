  "purpose": "Utility class for mapping code page integers to encoding names and decoding byte strings accordingly.",
  "sources": "Input byte strings provided to the decode() method.",
  "sinks": "Decoding operation on byte strings using guessed encoding or fallback.",
  "flows": "Byte input -> best_guess() determines encoding -> decode() uses encoding to decode bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward mapping and decoding logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a simple, standard utility for handling code pages and decoding byte strings. It uses a predefined map for known encodings and constructs fallback encoding names when necessary. The decode() method safely decodes bytes with the guessed encoding or defaults to a fallback. No external network calls, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The logic is correct, and the code is clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for encoding detection and decoding. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The decoding of untrusted data is typical for such utilities and does not constitute a security risk.",
