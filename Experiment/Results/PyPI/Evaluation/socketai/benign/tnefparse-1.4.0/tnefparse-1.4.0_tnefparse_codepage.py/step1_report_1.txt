  "purpose": "Provides a utility class for mapping code page identifiers to encoding names and decoding byte strings accordingly.",
  "sources": "Input to the decode() method, specifically byte_str parameter, which can be bytes or str.",
  "sinks": "The decode() method's usage of .decode() on byte strings with potentially untrusted or arbitrary encodings.",
  "flows": "Bytes input in decode() flows through .decode() using a guessed encoding from best_guess() or a fallback.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code dynamically selects encodings based on input but does not perform external network communication or malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code maps known code pages to encoding names, provides a fallback, and decodes byte strings accordingly. The best_guess() method returns encoding names based on known mappings or constructs 'cp' prefixed strings for unknown code pages. The decode() method decodes bytes using the guessed encoding or fallback. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The use of dynamic encoding selection is standard for such utilities, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility for encoding management and decoding. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks in this code.",
