  "purpose": "Unit tests for the tnefparse.codepage module to verify encoding guesses and decoding functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from hardcoded byte strings and integer code values within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "Assertions compare decoded strings and expected values; no external data sinks or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Input byte strings and code values are fed into Codepage class methods, with results compared to expected outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No use of network, file I/O, or external data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests for the Codepage class, verifying encoding guesses and decoding. No malicious or suspicious logic, no data leakage, no external communications, and no obfuscated code features. The code appears to serve purely testing purposes, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard unit testing of the Codepage class without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and intended for verifying encoding-related functionalities.",
