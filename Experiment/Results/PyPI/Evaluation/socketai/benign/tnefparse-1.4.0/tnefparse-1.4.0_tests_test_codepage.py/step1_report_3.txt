  "purpose": "Unit tests for the tnefparse.codepage module to verify encoding guesses and decoding functionality.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded data within test functions, including lists of encoding values and byte strings.",
  "sinks": "Assertions comparing expected strings and decoded bytes; no untrusted input sources or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded input data (codes, byte strings) flows through the Codepage class methods, with assertions verifying output correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test functions utilizing fixed input data to verify the behavior of the Codepage class. There are no external data sources, no user input handling, and no sensitive data processing. The assertions are standard for unit tests. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage are present. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or security-sensitive actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of unit tests for a module that handles character encoding. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and is focused purely on validating expected functionality.",
