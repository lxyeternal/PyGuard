{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for the tnefparse.codepage module, specifically testing encoding guesses and decoding functions of the Codepage class.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded integer codes and byte strings within test functions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data used solely for testing",
  "flows": "Instantiation of Codepage objects with fixed codes leading to decoding or guessing methods returning static results",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward test functions verifying encoding guesses and decoding correctness. No external input, network activity, or data leaks are present. The data are static, purpose-specific, and do not involve any malicious or obfuscated code. The scores assigned across reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign, static unit tests with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero. The reports accurately reflect the safety of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
