  "purpose": "Utility functions for data unpacking, GUID generation, date/time conversions, and checksum calculations.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read untrusted input directly; they operate on provided byte arrays or data.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions perform unsafe operations like executing code, writing to files, or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from byte arrays through unpacking and conversion functions, but no untrusted data is actively exploited.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The functions perform standard data manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides helper functions for unpacking binary data, generating UUIDs from byte arrays, and converting time formats. It uses safe, standard Python libraries and patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration. The functions are purely utility-oriented with no network or system modification logic. The lack of external input handling or output reduces risk. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for general use.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard utility operations without any suspicious behavior. It can be considered safe.",
