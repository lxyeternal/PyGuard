{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for data parsing, UUID generation, and time conversions, likely used in processing binary or structured data.",
  "sources": "Byte arrays passed to functions such as guid, systime, apptime, typtime, and bytes_to_int.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly send data over network, write to files, or perform external system actions. No sinks with untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Byte arrays are read from sources and converted into integers, UUIDs, or datetime objects within the same module; no external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behaviors observed. Use of broad exception handling in systime could mask errors but isn't malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for parsing structured binary data, converting bytes to integers, UUIDs, and date/time objects. All functions operate on provided byte arrays and do not perform external communication or data exfiltration. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident. Exception handling in systime is broad but not malicious. The code is clean, well-structured, and typical for data processing tasks. No obfuscation or malware patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists of benign utility functions for data parsing and conversion with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger system handling binary data. No malicious behavior detected.",
