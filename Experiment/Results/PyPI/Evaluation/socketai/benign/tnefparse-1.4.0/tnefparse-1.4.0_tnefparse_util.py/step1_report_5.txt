  "purpose": "Utility functions for data parsing and conversion, including byte unpacking, GUID creation, time conversions, and checksum calculation.",
  "sources": "byte arrays passed as function arguments in functions such as guid, systime, apptime, typtime, bytes_to_int, checksum.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write untrusted data or execute system commands; they process data and return values.",
  "flows": "Input byte arrays flow into unpacking functions, GUID creation, and time calculations; no data flows to external systems or insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. Functions perform standard data parsing and conversions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for byte data manipulation, including struct unpacking, GUID creation, time conversions, and checksum calculation. All functions operate solely on input byte arrays and return processed data. No suspicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The functions follow standard patterns for data parsing and do not invoke external commands or include hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for data processing without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs safe operations such as unpacking, GUID generation, and checksum calculation without side effects.",
