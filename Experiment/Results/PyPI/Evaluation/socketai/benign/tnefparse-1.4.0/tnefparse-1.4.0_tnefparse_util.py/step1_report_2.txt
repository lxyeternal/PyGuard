{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for data unpacking, GUID generation, datetime conversions, and checksum calculations.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read untrusted input directly; data inputs are parameters to functions, likely external but not inherently untrusted.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data in a suspicious manner.",
  "flows": "Functions process byte arrays to produce data types like integers, datetime objects, or UUIDs; no external data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. Exception handling in systime is broad but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward data processing utilities without external calls, network activity, or obfuscation. All functions are standard and safe. No malicious behavior or backdoors detected. The only minor concern is broad exception handling in systime, but it is for robustness, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe utility functions for data processing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
