  "purpose": "Utility functions for binary data unpacking, UUID generation, datetime conversions, and checksum calculations.",
  "sources": "Byte arrays passed to functions such as 'byte_arr' parameter in each function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions process data internally without external communication or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input byte arrays through unpacking or conversion functions; no external or network flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; broad exception handling in 'systime' is noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions for data unpacking, UUID creation, datetime conversions, and checksum calculation. All functions operate solely on provided byte arrays, with no external system interactions, network activity, or data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. Exception handling in 'systime' is broad but intended for robustness, not malicious concealment. Multiple reports agree on the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2). The code is standard, well-understood, and safe for use. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign utility functions with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with appropriate low scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. No modifications to scores are necessary.",
