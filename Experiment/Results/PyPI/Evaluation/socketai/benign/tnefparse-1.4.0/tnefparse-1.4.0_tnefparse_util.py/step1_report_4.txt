{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for data unpacking, GUID generation, and date/time conversions from byte arrays.",
  "sources": "byte arrays passed as arguments to functions: guid(), systime(), apptime(), typtime(), bytes_to_int(), checksum().",
  "targets": "None directly; no data is sent or transmitted outside the process; functions return processed data.",
  "flows": "Byte arrays are read in source functions, processed, and returned as Python data types; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; functions perform standard data conversions. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains utility functions for data unpacking and conversion, using standard libraries (struct, uuid, datetime). The functions perform straightforward operations such as unpacking binary data, generating UUIDs from byte arrays, and converting timestamps. The use of try-except in systime handles timestamp conversions robustly. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious activity. The code appears to be a typical utility module intended for processing binary data in larger applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain any backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The overall security risk score is low.",
