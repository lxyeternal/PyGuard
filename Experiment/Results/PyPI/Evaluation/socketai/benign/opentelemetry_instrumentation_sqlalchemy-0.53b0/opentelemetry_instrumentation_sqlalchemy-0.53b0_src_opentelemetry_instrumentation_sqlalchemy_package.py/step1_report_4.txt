  "purpose": "Define dependency constraints and support flags for OpenTelemetry instrumentation",
  "sources": "Hardcoded package version constraints in the '_instruments' variable and the '_supports_metrics' flag",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points that handle untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code only sets configuration variables",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists of static configuration variables with licensing comments",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily licensing information and static configuration assignments. The '_instruments' tuple specifies a range of acceptable versions for 'sqlalchemy', and '_supports_metrics' is a boolean flag. There are no inputs, data processing, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be a standard configuration snippet for an open-source project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of license headers and static configuration variables. No malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks are present.",
