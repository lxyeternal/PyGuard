  "purpose": "Define dependencies and support flags for an OpenTelemetry instrumentation package.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources; dependency specification string is hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow occurs in this minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; dependency string appears standard, and license comments are typical boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments, a tuple defining a dependency version constraint, and a boolean flag. No external data is read, no untrusted data is processed, and no code execution or network activity occurs. The dependency string is a standard requirement specification for the 'sqlalchemy' library, and the license comments are boilerplate from open-source licensing. There are no suspicious or unusual elements, obfuscated code, or potential malicious constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign, serving only as configuration or metadata for a package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks.",
