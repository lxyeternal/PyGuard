  "purpose": "Define dependency constraints and support flags for OpenTelemetry instrumentation.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs, network connections, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data propagation observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The license comments are standard and do not influence behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a tuple of package constraints for 'sqlalchemy' and a boolean flag indicating support for metrics. There are no dynamic code executions, no data handling, no network activity, or other suspicious behaviors. The license header is standard and does not affect runtime behavior. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward configuration snippet for dependency management with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
