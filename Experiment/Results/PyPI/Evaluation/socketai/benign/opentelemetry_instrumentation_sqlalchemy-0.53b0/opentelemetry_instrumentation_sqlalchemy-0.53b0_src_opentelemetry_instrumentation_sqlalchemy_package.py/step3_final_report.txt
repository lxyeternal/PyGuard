  "purpose": "Static dependency version constraints and feature flag declaration for open telemetry instrumentation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only static variable assignments and license comments.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static configuration with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration snippet defining a tuple '_instruments' with version constraints for 'sqlalchemy' and a boolean '_supports_metrics'. There are no dynamic elements, user inputs, environment variables, network activity, or code execution. The license comments are standard and do not influence runtime behavior. The code shows no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. All scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are accurate and no modifications are necessary.",
