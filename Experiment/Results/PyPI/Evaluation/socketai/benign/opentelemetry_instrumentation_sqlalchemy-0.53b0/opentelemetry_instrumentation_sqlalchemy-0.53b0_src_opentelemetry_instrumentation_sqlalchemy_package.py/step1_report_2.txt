  "purpose": "Define dependency specifications and feature support for an OpenTelemetry instrumentation module.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded tuple _instruments and boolean _supports_metrics.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data leaks or injections detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with only static data definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments specifying package version constraints and a feature flag. There are no dynamic inputs, no external data handling, nor any execution of untrusted code. The licensing comments are standard and do not affect security. Overall, the code appears to be a benign configuration snippet without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration fragment setting package dependencies and feature support flags. It does not contain any malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
