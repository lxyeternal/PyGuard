  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code; only license comments and version string.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and a version string assignment. No input, output, or data processing code is present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The license and version metadata are typical for open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard metadata and licensing boilerplate with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
