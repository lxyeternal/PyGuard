{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set metadata for a Python package, specifically defining the version of the package.",
  "sources": "The source is the assignment of the __version__ variable, which is a static string.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to a data leak or security effect.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the version string is hardcoded and not influenced by external input.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code consists solely of licensing comments and a version variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains licensing information and a single version variable assignment, which is standard for Python packages. No untrusted input handling, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious logic or malicious behavior detected. The content is typical package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as package metadata with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
