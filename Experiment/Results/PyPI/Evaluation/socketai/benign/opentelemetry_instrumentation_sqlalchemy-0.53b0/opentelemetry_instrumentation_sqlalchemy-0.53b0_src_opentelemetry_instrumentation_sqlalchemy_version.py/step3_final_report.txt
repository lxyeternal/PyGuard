  "purpose": "Static metadata declaration including license and version information for the open-source package.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only comments and a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from source to sink as there are no dynamic operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and standard for package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, consisting of license comments and a version string assignment. There are no executable statements, data processing, or external data interactions. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is typical boilerplate for open-source projects, with no security risks or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static metadata with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The existing reports correctly identify its nature and assign appropriate scores.",
