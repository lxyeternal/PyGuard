{
  "purpose": "The code provides routines for transliterating Arabic script into various formats, including Unicode, Buckwalter, SAMPA, and Latin, as well as language segmentation and digit normalization.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, external modules (e.g., pyarabic.araby), and user input in the main block. It processes text in functions such as convert(), segment_language(), normalize_digits(), encode_tashkeel(), and decode_tashkeel().",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain direct data sinks that could be exploited for malicious data leaks or system effects. No external network connections, file writes, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "The functions translate between transliteration schemes and language segmentation, with source data flowing through transformation functions like translate(), convertShadda(), and transliteration tables. There are no external or untrusted data flows that lead to security-sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of transliteration routines and language segmentation. The main block processes sample data for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly provides transliteration and language detection functions, utilizing static lookup tables and regular expressions. It imports an external module 'pyarabic.araby' and uses its constants and functions. There are no network operations, system commands, or file I/O. The code handles input data carefully, with no evident injection points or insecure data handling. The main block demonstrates usage with predefined test strings, indicating testing rather than malicious activity. The logic appears standard for linguistic processing, with no suspicious functions or data flows that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a linguistic utility library for Arabic transliteration and language segmentation. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. There are no indicators of malware or malicious data handling. The code appears safe for use within its intended scope.",
