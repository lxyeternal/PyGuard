{
  "purpose": "The code provides routines for transliterating Arabic text between different formats, including UTF-8, Tim Buckwalter, and SAMPA phonemes, as well as language segmentation and digit normalization.",
  "sources": "Reads input text for transliteration, language detection, digit normalization, and encoding/decoding of diacritics.",
  "sinks": "Outputs transliterated strings, segmented language text, and normalized digits; does not contain data sinks that could leak untrusted data externally.",
  "flows": "Input text is processed through functions like convert, tim2utf8, utf82tim, and normalize_digits, with internal mappings for transliteration and normalization, but no external data flows or network communication present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated code or hidden network activities. Uses standard libraries and explicit data mappings. Functions perform expected transformations without unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive transliteration and language processing tool for Arabic script, implementing character mappings, digit normalization, and language detection. It contains no suspicious or malicious logic, no external data transmission, nor any functions that could be used for data theft, system damage, or covert access. All operations are consistent with the stated purpose of linguistic processing. The code appears well-structured, with clear and explicit data transformations, and no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and intended for Arabic transliteration, language segmentation, and digit normalization. There are no indications of malicious intent or supply chain security risks.",
