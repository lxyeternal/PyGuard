{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for transliteration, segmenting, and converting Arabic script between various formats, including transliteration schemes and encoding/decoding diacritics. It is intended for linguistic processing of Arabic text.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments, including text strings for transliteration and segmentation, and reads input from standard input in the main block for testing purposes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external systems or perform network operations. It processes data internally and outputs to the console during testing, with no evident data leakage or malicious effect.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables (like 'text', 'word') through transliteration and segmentation functions, with transformations applied via translation tables. There are no external or untrusted data sinks such as network or filesystem writes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code uses standard libraries and transliteration logic. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present. The code's main operations are linguistic transformations and formatting.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily implements linguistic functions for Arabic text processing, including transliteration, segmentation, digit normalization, and diacritic encoding/decoding. It defines multiple translation tables and methods for converting between different scripts and schemes. The main block performs test conversions and language segmentation. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote connections, or system harm. The code does include input handling via function arguments but no external network or file system interactions. No suspicious obfuscation or malware patterns are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard linguistic processing utility for Arabic transliteration and text segmentation with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely performs data transformations and linguistic analyses without external data leaks or harmful operations.",
