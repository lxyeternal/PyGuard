  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a linguistic utility for Arabic transliteration, segmentation, and normalization.\n- No reports mention external network activity, file I/O, or other data sinks that could be exploited maliciously.\n- The code relies on static mappings, regex for language detection, and standard Python features.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n- The main block is used for testing/demo purposes, not for malicious activity.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code's purpose aligns with legitimate linguistic processing.\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or supply chain security issues.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, as the code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- Security risk: very low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- The only minor concern could be processing untrusted input, but given the context, the code does not perform any external actions or data exfiltration.\n- The code does not contain any code injection, remote code execution, or similar vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- All reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The overall assessment is that the code is safe, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My personal estimate:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no signs of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, mainly due to processing untrusted input, but no external threats)\n\n**Final note:** The code is a legitimate linguistic utility with no security concerns.",
