{
  "purpose": "Provides transliteration, language segmentation, digit normalization, and diacritic encoding/decoding functions for Arabic text, primarily using static lookup tables, regex, and external module 'pyarabic.araby'. No external network or file I/O observed.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, regex for language detection, static lookup tables, external module 'pyarabic.araby'.",
  "sinks": "Internal string transformations; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through transliteration, segmentation, normalization, and encoding/decoding functions; no external communication or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious external calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a linguistic utility for Arabic transliteration, segmentation, and normalization. It relies on static mappings, regex, and external constants. No external network activity, file I/O, or malicious code patterns are present. The functions are straightforward, and the main block is for testing/demo purposes. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are evident. The security implications are minimal, primarily processing untrusted input without external effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Arabic text processing utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for supply chain use, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.",
