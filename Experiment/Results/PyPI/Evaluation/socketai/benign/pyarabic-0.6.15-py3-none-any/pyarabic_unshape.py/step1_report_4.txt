{
  "purpose": "The script converts Arabic-shaped letters to their unshaped form to support rendering in programs that do not support Arabic text shaping.",
  "sources": "Input text strings provided in the main block; functions reading text data from string variables.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs processed text to the console via print statements; no external sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through functions 'unshaping_text' -> 'unshaping_line' -> 'unshaping_word', resulting in output to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. The logic is straightforward character replacement based on a predefined table. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports future unicode_literals, defines a table for Unicode character replacements, and implements functions to process and reverse Arabic letter shaping. The functions split text into lines, process each line, split lines into words, and process each word character-by-character for replacement. The main block demonstrates usage with sample strings. There are no external data reads, no network activity, or hidden behaviors. The code appears to be a benign utility script for text processing. No anomalies, malicious patterns, or suspicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for unshaping Arabic text. It performs character replacements based on a predefined table with no malicious intent or security risks present. The script is straightforward and intended for text processing.",
