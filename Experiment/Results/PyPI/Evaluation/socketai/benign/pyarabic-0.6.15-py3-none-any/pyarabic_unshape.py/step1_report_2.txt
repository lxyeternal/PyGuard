{
  "purpose": "The script provides functions to unshape Arabic text, converting shaped characters to their unshaped form for rendering purposes.",
  "sources": "Input text from function parameters (unshaping_text, unshaping_line, unshaping_word) and the __main__ block where example texts are defined directly in the code.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send data over the network, write to files, or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data (hardcoded or passed to functions) flows into unshaping functions which process and return the modified text. There are no external system interactions or untrusted data sources beyond the initial hardcoded strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are present. The code is straightforward string manipulation for linguistic processing. There is commented out code that is inactive. No obfuscated code, hidden logic, or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed solely for transforming Arabic text from a shaped to an unshaped form. It employs a dictionary for character replacements and processes input strings through splitting, reversing, and character substitution. No external inputs are read dynamically, nor are there network or file operations, or any side effects that could be malicious. The functions are standard string processing routines with examples in the __main__ block. Overall, the code appears purely linguistic and educational in intent, with no indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for Arabic text unshaping. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It performs standard string operations with no external data handling or security risks.",
