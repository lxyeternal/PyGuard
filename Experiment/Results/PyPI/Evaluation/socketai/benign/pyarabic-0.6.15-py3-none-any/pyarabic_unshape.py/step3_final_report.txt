  "purpose": "Convert shaped Arabic characters into their unshaped forms for rendering purposes in environments lacking proper Arabic support.",
  "sources": "Input text strings provided to functions, static strings in main block",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting processed text",
  "flows": "Input text -> unshaping_line/unshaping_word functions -> character replacement via UNSHAPING_TABLE -> output text",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward string processing with static data",
  "analysis": "The code performs static Unicode character replacements to unshape Arabic text, processing line-by-line and word-by-word, reversing word order per line. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The logic is simple, well-documented, and does not involve dynamic code execution or malicious patterns. The security implications are minimal, with no hardcoded credentials, no external interactions, and no suspicious behaviors. The provided reports correctly identify the benign nature of the script, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. The code's purpose is linguistic, not malicious, and the scores are consistent with its behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward utility for Arabic text unshaping with no security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code's nature.",
