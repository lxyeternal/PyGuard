  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \nThe script is a utility for converting shaped Arabic characters into their unshaped forms, primarily for rendering purposes in environments lacking proper Arabic support. It uses a predefined Unicode mapping table, processes text line-by-line, reverses word order within lines, and performs character replacements. The code contains no network activity, no external data handling beyond static strings, and no obfuscated or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **Presence of the code's functionality** matches the described purpose: converting shaped Arabic characters to unshaped forms.\n- **No malicious behavior** is evident; the code is straightforward string processing.\n- **No security vulnerabilities** such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- **Input sources** are static strings or function parameters; no dynamic external inputs are involved.\n- **Output sinks** are print statements; no data exfiltration or external communication.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code performs a benign linguistic utility task with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**  \n- All reports agree that the script is a straightforward, non-malicious text processing utility.\n- They highlight the absence of suspicious behaviors, external data handling, or obfuscation.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and malware/security risk scores are 0.\n- They mention no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, and no obfuscation.\n\n**Any errors or flaws in the reports?**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the code's purpose and behavior.\n- They do not identify any logical flaws or security concerns.\n- The only minor note is that the code is static and does not handle dynamic or untrusted input, but this is expected for its purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity or payload detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The code could be expanded to handle dynamic input securely or process files, but as-is, it is safe.\n- The reversal of word order is intentional for display purposes; no security implications.\n- No signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on all reviews and the code's nature, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**  \n\nThe code is a benign utility script for Arabic text unshaping with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate; the code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. No changes to scores are necessary.",
