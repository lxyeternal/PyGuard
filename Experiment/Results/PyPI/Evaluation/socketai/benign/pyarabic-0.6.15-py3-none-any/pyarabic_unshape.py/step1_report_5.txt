{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to convert Arabic script characters from their shaped forms to unshaped (disconnected) forms for rendering purposes in programs that do not support Arabic letter shaping.",
  "sources": "The code reads input text, which can be provided via function arguments or from the __main__ section (hardcoded sample text, line, and word variables).",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the transformed text via print statements. There are no external data sinks, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Input text is processed through functions: unshaping_text (splits into lines), unshaping_line (splits into words, reverses order), unshaping_word (maps characters via UNSHAPING_TABLE), and then reconstructs the text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors such as dynamic code execution, backdoors, or malicious logic. The only noteworthy aspect is the hardcoded sample data and the use of print statements, which are benign. No hardcoded credentials, network access, or obfuscated code is present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward utility for Arabic unshaping. It relies on a predefined mapping table (UNSHAPING_TABLE) to replace shaped characters with unshaped ones. Functions process text line-by-line and word-by-word, reversing word order in lines for correct directional display. No external input/output besides console printing. No network or file operations are present. The code does not contain malicious code or behaviors; it is purely a text transformation utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a text processing tool for Arabic script rendering. It does not include any malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The implementation is clear, and no security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
