{
  "purpose": "Convert Arabic text from shaped to unshaped form for rendering in environments that do not support Arabic letter shaping.",
  "sources": "Input text received via function parameters; static strings in main block for demonstration.",
  "sinks": "Output via print statements; no data leakage or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input text → split into lines/words/characters → lookup and reconstruct unshaped text → output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary mapping Unicode shaped Arabic characters to their unshaped equivalents. It provides functions to process text line-by-line and word-by-word, reconstructing unshaped text. The main block demonstrates usage with static Arabic text and prints the results. No external network calls, no system modification commands, or hidden behaviors are present. Usage is purely text transformation. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a specific text transformation task without any malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is a benign utility script designed for Arabic text processing.",
