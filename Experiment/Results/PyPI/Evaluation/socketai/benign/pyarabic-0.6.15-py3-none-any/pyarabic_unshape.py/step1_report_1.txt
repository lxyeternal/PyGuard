{
  "purpose": "The script converts shaped Arabic characters to their unshaped forms, facilitating proper rendering in environments lacking Arabic support.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from string variables, including 'TEXTS', 'LINE', and 'WORD'. User-provided input could be tested if used dynamically.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily outputs processed text via print statements; no direct data leaks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through functions 'unshaping_text', 'unshaping_line', and 'unshaping_word', transforming shaped characters into unshaped forms without external data or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs character replacements based on a predefined mapping, reversing the order of words in lines, and processing text in a predictable manner. There are no indications of malicious intent or security issues. Usage is limited to text transformation. No network operations, file manipulations, or system commands are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign text processing tool designed for Arabic text shaping management. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. Its structure is clear, and no anomalies or suspicious activities are detected.",
