{
  "purpose": "Define constant sets of Arabic linguistic tokens for use in a larger NLP or linguistic processing application.",
  "sources": "Static data definitions; no input reading functions present.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks or untrusted data handling points; no data output, network communication, or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; all data is statically defined.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only constant data declarations; no suspicious code, obfuscated structures, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of set and list definitions with Arabic strings, primarily for linguistic purposes. It imports a future feature for Unicode literals, but does not perform any I/O operations, external calls, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious patterns are evident. The code appears straightforward, defining linguistic constants for further use.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign collection of static data constants used for linguistic processing in Arabic. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
