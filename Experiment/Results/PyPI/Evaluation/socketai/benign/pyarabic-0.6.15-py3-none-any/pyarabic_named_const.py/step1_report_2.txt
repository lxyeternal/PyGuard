  "purpose": "Define constant sets of Arabic words and proper nouns used in some natural language processing or text analysis application.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals within set definitions, imported future module for unicode_literals.",
  "sinks": "No user input, network operations, or sensitive data handling present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; the code only declares static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors; code is straightforward, defining constant sets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future unicode_literals for compatibility, then defines multiple sets and a list of Arabic words and proper nouns. These are static data structures with no dynamic code execution, input/output operations, or external interactions. No obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The data appears to serve linguistic or semantic processing purposes. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of constants for linguistic processing, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
