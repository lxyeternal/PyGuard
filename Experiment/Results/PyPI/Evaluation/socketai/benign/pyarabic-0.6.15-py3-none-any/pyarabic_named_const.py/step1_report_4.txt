  "purpose": "Defines sets of Arabic words and proper nouns, likely for linguistic processing or filtering.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions and imported future module for unicode_literals.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks; no external data or untrusted inputs processed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static constant definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely declares several sets and a list of Arabic words and proper nouns. It uses unicode_literals for compatibility. There are no functions, input/output operations, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code appears to be a static resource or dictionary for language processing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, comprising static constant definitions for linguistic processing. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
