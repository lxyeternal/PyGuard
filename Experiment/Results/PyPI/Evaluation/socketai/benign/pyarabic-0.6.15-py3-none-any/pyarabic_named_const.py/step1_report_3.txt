  "purpose": "Define constants including various sets and lists of Arabic words and phrases for use in language processing or analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, imported __future__ unicode_literals for compatibility.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no I/O operations or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constants to potential use points, but no dynamic or untrusted input processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, backdoors, or hidden functions. The code is straightforward data definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__ for Unicode compatibility, then defines multiple sets and lists of Arabic words and phrases, presumably for linguistic analysis or processing. The data structures are static, hardcoded, and there are no functions, I/O, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or security risks are present. The code appears purely as a language resource module without any malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign resource module containing static linguistic constants with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
