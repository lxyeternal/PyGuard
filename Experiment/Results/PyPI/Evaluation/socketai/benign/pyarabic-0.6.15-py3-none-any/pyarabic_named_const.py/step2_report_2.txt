  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   - The code consists solely of static set and list definitions containing Arabic words and proper nouns.  \n   - There are no input/output operations, dynamic code execution, network calls, or data processing.  \n   - No obfuscation, encryption, or malicious code patterns are evident.  \n   - The import of `__future__.unicode_literals` is standard for compatibility and does not introduce any security concerns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, static, and without malicious intent.  \n   - They do not identify any logical errors or flaws in the code.  \n   - The assessments are consistent and accurate given the code's nature.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 0.5 at most, which seems appropriate.  \n   - Since the code is purely static data with no malicious behavior, these scores are reasonable.  \n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   - The highest risk scores are 0 or 0.5, which is justified because the code is static and benign.  \n   - No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities justifies higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   - The malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis that no malicious activity is present.  \n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain hidden payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a static resource for linguistic purposes.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n**Final Evaluation**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a straightforward static resource module defining Arabic linguistic constants. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n**My personal estimate** aligns with the reports:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis confirms that the code is safe and benign.",
