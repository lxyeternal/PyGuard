{
  "purpose": "Static definitions of Arabic linguistic constants, including sets of words and proper nouns, used for language processing tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from predefined sets and lists of Arabic words and proper nouns.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only initializes static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, defining sets and lists of Arabic words and proper nouns. It imports __future__.unicode_literals for compatibility but contains no input/output, network calls, or dynamic code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The code serves as a linguistic resource module. All indicators point to benign, static data with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static resource module for linguistic constants, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The analysis and scores in the provided reports are accurate and justified.",
