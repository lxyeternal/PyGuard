  "purpose": "Define sets of Arabic words and proper nouns for linguistic or processing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code contains static definitions of word sets and proper nouns; no external data input or user input processing observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output operations, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code purely defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future unicode_literals for compatibility, then defines several sets of Arabic words and proper nouns. These sets are static and hardcoded. There are no input operations, data processing, network calls, or execution of dynamic code. No obfuscation, encryption, or code injection mechanisms are present. The code appears to serve as a static resource for language processing, with no malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward static data definition module containing sets of Arabic words and proper nouns. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and solely serves as a data repository.",
