{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for recognizing and extracting Arabic named entities within text, including proper nouns and specific phrase patterns.",
  "sources": "The code reads input text via function parameters and the __main__ block, which processes predefined sample texts.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that send untrusted data externally or perform harmful actions are present. No network connections, file writes, or system modifications are observed.",
  "flows": "Input text is tokenized and processed through various functions to identify named entity positions, extract phrases, and vocalize names, but no external data flows or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain suspicious code such as dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data are present. The functions operate purely for text processing without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and custom modules for Arabic text processing. It includes functions for detecting proper nouns, named entity positions, and vocalization, all of which are normal for linguistic processing. The presence of sample texts in the __main__ block does not indicate malicious intent. There are no network calls, system modifications, or obfuscated behaviors. The code structure and logic appear to be straightforward and aligned with its linguistic purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Arabic named entity recognition utility without any malicious or sabotage elements. It solely performs text analysis using predefined lists and tokenization functions. There are no signs of malware, malicious payloads, or security risks.",
