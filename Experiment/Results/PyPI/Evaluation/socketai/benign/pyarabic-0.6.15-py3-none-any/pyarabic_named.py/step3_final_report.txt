  "purpose": "Arabic Named Entity Recognition (NER) utility that identifies proper nouns and specific phrase patterns within Arabic text, utilizing pattern matching and tokenization.",
  "sources": "Reads input text, tokenizes it, and processes tokens via external modules (pyarabic.araby, propernouns, named_const) for pattern detection and recognition.",
  "sinks": "In-memory processing; no external data sinks, network communication, or file operations are involved.",
  "flows": "Input text → tokenization → pattern matching and proper noun checks → output of identified named entities and positions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard NLP tasks for Arabic text, relying on external, well-known modules. It uses pattern matching, tokenization, and pattern detection functions to identify named entities. No network, file, or system modifications are present. The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. External dependencies are standard for Arabic NLP and do not indicate malicious behavior. The code is well-structured, with clear functions and comments, and no suspicious patterns or behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Arabic NLP utility focused on named entity recognition. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The external modules are standard and do not introduce threats. The overall security risk is minimal, with a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0. The risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the low inherent risk of NLP dependencies.",
