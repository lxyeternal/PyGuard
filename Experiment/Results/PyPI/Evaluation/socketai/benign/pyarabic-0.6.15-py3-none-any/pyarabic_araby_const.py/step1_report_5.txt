{
  "purpose": "This module provides Unicode constants, regular expressions, and utility functions for processing Arabic script, including character classification, ligature handling, and diacritic management.",
  "sources": "It reads Unicode string constants, imported modules (re, pyarabic.stack, pyarabic.araby_const), and uses regular expressions to process text data.",
  "sinks": "The code compiles regex patterns for text processing, which could potentially be used to filter or validate input data; no direct data sinks like network or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "The regex patterns are used to identify or manipulate text segments based on character classes, which could influence further data processing pipelines but do not directly process untrusted data within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only Unicode character constants, regex patterns, and imports, with no apparent malicious behavior or suspicious code constructs. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or system modifications are present. No obfuscation or code execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The module defines constants for Arabic characters and diacritics, compiles regex patterns for text parsing, and provides character classification data. It relies on standard libraries and external modules (pyarabic) for processing Arabic script. There are no functions performing I/O, network, or system modifications. The patterns are used for text analysis or filtering, not for malicious purposes. The code appears to be a straightforward utility library for Arabic text handling, with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module designed for processing Arabic text. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code primarily defines constants and regex patterns for linguistic processing. No security concerns are evident based on this code fragment.",
