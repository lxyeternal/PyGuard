  "purpose": "Static definitions of Unicode characters, ligatures, diacritics, and regex patterns for processing Arabic script in text normalization and analysis.",
  "sources": "Constants defining Unicode characters and regex patterns compiled for matching diacritics, ligatures, hamzas, and character groups within Arabic text.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or output data; it only defines static patterns and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external sources or sinks; the code is purely static definitions and pattern compilations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains straightforward Unicode constants and regex patterns without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module defining Unicode constants, character groupings, and regex patterns for Arabic text processing. It imports only benign modules, compiles regex for internal use, and contains no functions or runtime logic. No external data handling, network activity, or code execution occurs. The regex patterns are standard for linguistic normalization. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The code's purpose is purely linguistic and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for Arabic script processing, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with its static, data-defining nature.",
