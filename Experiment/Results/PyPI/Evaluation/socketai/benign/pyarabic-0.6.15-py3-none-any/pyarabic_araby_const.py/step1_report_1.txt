{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions and constants for processing Arabic text, including handling Unicode characters, diacritics, ligatures, and pattern matching for text analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports of external libraries (`re`, `pyarabic.stack`, `pyarabic.araby_const`), and internal Unicode constants and compiled regex patterns for processing Arabic script.",
  "sinks": "Regex patterns are compiled for matching Arabic characters, diacritics, ligatures, and special symbols; no data sinks or external data output mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "The code defines character constants, compiles regex patterns for text processing; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or output actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior is present. All imported modules are standard or related to Arabic text processing. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are evident. The code is primarily data definitions and pattern compilation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Unicode constants for Arabic characters, diacritics, ligatures, and related symbols. It creates character groupings and pattern objects for matching specific Arabic script features. There are no functions performing data manipulation, no external network calls, or file I/O. All regex patterns are for internal text processing. The code appears to be a language processing utility module without malicious intent. No obfuscated code, no suspicious code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for Arabic text processing. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code mainly defines constants and regex patterns for internal use, with no external communication or suspicious logic.",
