  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the findings are accurate, consistent, and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility module defining constants and regex patterns for Arabic text processing. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is mainly data definitions and pattern compilation for linguistic purposes. There are no functions executing malicious logic, no data flows involving untrusted input, and no suspicious code.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — all appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the benign nature of the code, focusing on constants and regex patterns for language processing.\n\n- **Assessment:** The observations are consistent with the code content. No suspicious behavior, no external data handling, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a set of constants and regex patterns for Arabic script processing, with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Assessment:** The detailed analysis aligns with the code's structure. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious logic, or external data leaks.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines constants and regex patterns for Arabic text processing, with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion is consistent with the code content. No functions, no data flows involving untrusted sources, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility for Arabic script processing, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes that the code is static, with constants and regex patterns, and no I/O or malicious logic.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports agree that the code is benign, primarily defining constants and regex patterns for Arabic text processing.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. All malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are zero, matching the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  None are needed here. The code is purely static data and pattern definitions.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The code does not perform any malicious activity; the malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions and correctly interpret the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated security risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a static utility module for Arabic text processing, with no dynamic behavior, no external data handling, and no malicious constructs. All scores are appropriately zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, consistent, and justified. The code is benign and safe, with no security concerns.",
