{
  "purpose": "This module provides Unicode constants, regular expressions, and utility functions for processing Arabic text, including handling of diacritics, ligatures, and character classifications.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules (__future__, re, pyarabic.stack, pyarabic.araby_const), defines Unicode character constants, and compiles regex patterns for text processing.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any data sinks or functions that process untrusted input beyond regex pattern matching; no data is sent over network or stored.",
  "flows": "The code defines regex patterns for matching diacritics, ligatures, and other characters, but there is no evidence of data flow from input to insecure handling or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The regex patterns are standard for text processing. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is observed.",
  "analysis": "The script appears to be a straightforward library defining constants and regex patterns for Arabic text processing. It imports standard and third-party modules without any suspicious functions or behavior. The constants and patterns are used for linguistic analysis, not malicious purposes. No code writes to files, network, or accesses sensitive data. No malicious behavior or sabotage is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign language utility module for Arabic text processing. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply defines constants, patterns, and constants for use in other applications.",
