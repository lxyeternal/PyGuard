No external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network or file operations. The normalization function `normalize_searchtext()` is undefined here but likely imported from the `normalize` module, which is standard practice.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic:**  \n  The broad exception clause during import (`except:`) could mask import errors, but this is a common pattern and not malicious. The normalization functions are applied only to internal constants, with no external data processing, reducing risk.\n\n- **Scores and Reasonableness:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's static, benign nature. The risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), appropriate given the lack of external or untrusted data handling.\n\n- **Malware Justification:****\n  The code does not perform any malicious actions: no code injection, no network activity, no data exfiltration, no dynamic code execution. The normalization routines are safe and only operate on predefined constants.\n\n- **Assumptions and Claims:**\n  The reports assume that normalization functions are safe and that constants are static. This is reasonable; no evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n- **Consistency of Scores:**\n  The scores are consistent with the code's behavior: no malware, no obfuscation, very low security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- **Should remain at 0.** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- **Should remain at 0.** The code is clear and well-structured, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- **Should stay low (~0.1-0.2).** The only minor concern is the broad exception clause, which is standard but could mask import errors. It does not pose a security risk.\n\n**Overall Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**\n\n| Score Type     | Suggested Value | Justification                                                      |\n|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 | No malicious activity or code injection detected.                   |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 | Clear, static constants with no obfuscation.                        |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1 - 0.2         | Very low; standard import pattern, no external data handling.     |\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\nThe code appears to be a benign language resource module for Arabic number words, with normalization routines. No malicious signals or security vulnerabilities are evident. The normalization functions are applied solely to internal constants, and the overall design is straightforward.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. Maintain the current low malware and risk scores.",
