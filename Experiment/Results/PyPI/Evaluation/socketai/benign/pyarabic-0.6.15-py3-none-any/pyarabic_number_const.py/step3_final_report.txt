  "purpose": "Constants and normalization routines for Arabic number words and their variants, used for language normalization.",
  "sources": "Static constants, external modules 'araby' and 'normalize' with a broad try-except fallback.",
  "sinks": "No external data input/output, no network or file system effects.",
  "flows": "Normalization functions process internal constants only, no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception on import; reliance on external 'normalize_searchtext()' function not shown but presumed benign.",
  "analysis": "The code contains static data for Arabic number words, units, and grammatical forms, with normalization routines applied to standardize these constants. No dynamic code execution, external data ingestion, or system modifications are present. The broad exception clause is a common pattern, not suspicious. The normalization routines only act on internal constants, minimizing risk. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign language processing utility providing constants for Arabic number words and their variants. It performs no malicious actions, has no external data handling, and is free of obfuscation. The normalization routines are safe and only operate on internal data. The overall security risk is negligible.",
