  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization file (__init__.py) containing only comments, author info, licensing, and a module docstring, with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "Comments, author attribution, license notices, and module docstring",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or external data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted sources to sinks; static metadata only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is static, metadata-only, with standard comments and documentation",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static comments, author info, licensing, and a module docstring typical for a package __init__.py. There are no functions, data processing, input/output, dynamic code, or external connections. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code's simplicity and static nature eliminate any security risks or malware potential. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, and confidence: 1 are consistent with the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as metadata for the package. There are no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation present. The current assessment and scores are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
