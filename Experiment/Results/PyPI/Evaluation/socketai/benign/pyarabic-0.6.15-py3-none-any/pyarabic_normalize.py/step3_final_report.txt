{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for normalizing Arabic text, including stripping diacritics, tatweel, and normalizing hamza, lam alef ligatures, and spelling errors, relying on an external 'araby' module.",
  "sources": "Reads input text parameters; calls functions and regex patterns from the 'araby' module.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network operations; processing is confined to in-memory string manipulations.",
  "flows": "Input text -> normalization functions -> output text; no external data flows or untrusted data effects.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling during module import (try-except) which could mask import errors but is not malicious; reliance on external 'araby' module without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward text normalization functions that utilize regex substitutions and external module functions. No network, file, or environment variable interactions are present. The broad import exception does not perform malicious actions. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected. The functions serve their intended purpose without side effects or external data leaks. The reliance on 'araby' is typical for such utilities, and no malicious behavior is evident within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-documented set of Arabic text normalization utilities with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
