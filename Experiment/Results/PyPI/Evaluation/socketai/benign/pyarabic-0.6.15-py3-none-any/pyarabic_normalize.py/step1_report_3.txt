{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for normalizing Arabic text by removing diacritics, tatweel, and normalizing hamza, lamalef ligatures, and common spelling errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'araby' module (either locally or from package), regex patterns for hamza and alef normalization.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; functions perform string transformations without external communications or side effects.",
  "flows": "Input text is processed through regex substitutions and function calls, with no external data flows or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward, designed for text normalization, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides text normalization utilities specifically for Arabic script, including removal of diacritics and normalization of ligatures and common spelling variants. The use of regex and method calls appears standard. No external data is fetched or sent, no command execution, and no suspicious file operations are present. The only potential concern could be reliance on external 'araby' module, but this is part of the intended functionality. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a legitimate utility for Arabic text normalization with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not perform any harmful operations.",
