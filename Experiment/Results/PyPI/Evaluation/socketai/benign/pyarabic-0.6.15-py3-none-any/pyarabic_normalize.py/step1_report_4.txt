{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for normalizing Arabic text by removing diacritics, ligatures, and normalizing specific characters for search and indexing purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'araby' module or package, which provides functions and patterns for Arabic text normalization.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are evident. The code uses regex substitutions on input text but does not process external untrusted input beyond function parameters.",
  "flows": "Input text is passed into functions like strip_tashkeel, strip_tatweel, normalize_hamza, normalize_lamalef, and normalize_spellerrors; these functions perform regex-based replacements. The normalized output is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code relies on external 'araby' module functions, but no embedded or obfuscated code is present. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for Arabic text normalization, primarily through regex substitutions and calls to an external module 'araby'. The try-except block imports 'araby' either directly or from the local package, which is typical for compatibility. All functions operate solely on input text and return processed text; no network, file, or environment variable interactions are present. The functions are straightforward and focused on text normalization. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility module for Arabic text normalization. It contains no malicious code or behaviors. It simply processes input text for search and indexing purposes. The module's design and implementation are consistent with its intended purpose without any suspicious activity.",
