{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for normalizing Arabic text, including stripping diacritics, tatweel, and normalizing hamza, lam alef ligatures, and common spelling errors, to prepare text for search and indexing.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'araby' or local module '.araby', which provide the core text processing functions and patterns such as 'strip_tashkeel', 'strip_tatweel', 'ALEFAT_PATTERN', 'HAMZAT_PATTERN', 'TEH_MARBUTA', 'HEH', 'ALEF_MAKSURA', 'YEH'.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or output operations that handle untrusted input are present; all processing involves safe string manipulations and regex substitutions.",
  "flows": "Input Arabic text flows through various normalization functions that call external library functions and regex replacements, ultimately returning a normalized text. No untrusted data is executed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies heavily on an external 'araby' module, but does not execute any dynamic code, external commands, or handle secrets. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. Error handling is minimal but non-malicious. The broad exception handling during import could mask import issues but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a collection of text normalization functions for Arabic language processing. It imports a dedicated module for core processing functions, which presumably contain the actual logic for stripping diacritics, tatweel, and applying regex patterns for normalization. The functions are well-documented, with examples illustrating intended use. There are no system calls, network operations, or code execution. The use of regex for spelling corrections appears safe. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The script appears to be a legitimate linguistic utility module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign Arabic text normalization utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to process and normalize text for search purposes. The use of external language processing modules is typical and not suspicious. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
