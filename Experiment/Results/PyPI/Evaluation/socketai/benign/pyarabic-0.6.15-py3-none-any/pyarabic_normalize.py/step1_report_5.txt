  "purpose": "Utility functions for normalizing Arabic text by removing diacritics, ligatures, and normalizing specific characters for search and indexing purposes.",
  "sources": "import statements, especially 'araby' module; functions like strip_tashkeel, strip_tatweel, normalize_hamza, normalize_lamalef, normalize_spellerrors, and normalize_searchtext.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications. It primarily processes text data within the application.",
  "flows": "Input text is processed through various normalization functions, with no external data flows or untrusted data sources beyond typical text input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The exception handling for importing 'araby' is standard and harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of text normalization functions tailored for Arabic text. It uses regular expressions and external 'araby' module functions to remove diacritics, tatweel, and normalize certain characters. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security risks. The import fallback for 'araby' is standard for handling module import variations. The functions only manipulate text data without external communication or harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward, well-structured set of text normalization utilities for Arabic language processing. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this code.",
