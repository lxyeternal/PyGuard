{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and a class to convert numbers to their Arabic textual representation, vocalize number words, and analyze text to extract and process Arabic number phrases.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, such as text input to functions like text2number, number2text, detect_number_phrases_position, and from the main script processing predefined TEXTS.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks include the console output via print statements, and optional charset conversion in the int2str method. No network, file system, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input text is tokenized and processed through functions like detect_number_phrases_position and detect_numbers, with potential conversion to number or textual forms. There are no external data flows beyond standard processing and printing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious system calls are present. The code uses standard math operations, imports, and exception handling. Import errors fallback to relative imports but do not execute malicious code. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs linguistic processing of Arabic numbers, converting text to numbers and vice versa, and analyzing text for number phrases. It includes functions for vocalization, phrase detection, and number-to-text conversions, with clear and standard implementations. The presence of print statements is for debugging or demonstration, not malicious activity. The code uses safe standard libraries (math, sys) and handles import errors gracefully. No network activity, file manipulation, or external system access occurs. Overall, the code appears to be a well-structured language processing module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a linguistic utility for Arabic number processing with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It operates solely on input text, performing conversions and analysis. The security risk score is low, with no malicious indicators detected.",
