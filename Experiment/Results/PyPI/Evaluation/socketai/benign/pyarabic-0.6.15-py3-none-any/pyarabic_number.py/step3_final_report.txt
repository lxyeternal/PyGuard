{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for converting Arabic numerals to text, text to numerals, vocalizing numbers, and extracting number phrases from Arabic text, primarily for linguistic processing.",
  "sources": "External modules (`araby`, `number_const`, `named_const`, `arabrepr`) imported with fallback error handling; input data from function parameters and sample texts.",
  "sinks": "No network, file, or system modifications; data flows within text processing functions without external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Input text is tokenized and processed through functions like `detect_number_phrases_position`, `detect_numbers`, and conversion functions, with no external sinks or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; print statements are for debugging or demonstration, not malicious activity; external modules are imported safely with fallback handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a clear, well-structured linguistic utility for Arabic numerals, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or dangerous operations. External dependencies are handled gracefully, and no network or system calls are present. The print statements are benign. The logic for number conversion and extraction is consistent and appropriate for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Arabic number processing utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
