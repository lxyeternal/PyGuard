{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions and classes to convert numbers between textual and numeric forms in Arabic, vocalize numbers, and extract number phrases from text.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the parameter 'number', 'text', 'wordlist', and external modules such as 'araby', 'number_const', 'named_const'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include string operations, print statements, and functions that process untrusted text for number conversion and extraction.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables (e.g., 'text', 'wordlist') through functions like 'detect_number_phrases_position', 'extract_number_phrases', 'detect_number_words', and ultimately to print/output functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution techniques. External imports are optional and handled gracefully. The code performs standard text processing with no suspicious system calls or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive implementation of Arabic number processing functions, including number-to-text conversions, text-to-number conversions, vocalizations, and phrase extraction. It relies on external modules for Arabic language processing ('araby', 'arabrepr', constants) but does not execute any external code or commands dynamically. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or system disruptions. The functions are designed for linguistic processing and do not perform network activities or access sensitive data. The structure is standard and well-organized for its purpose, with no unusual or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate linguistic utility for Arabic number processing. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It primarily manipulates text for conversion and extraction purposes, with no malicious side effects or dangerous operations.",
