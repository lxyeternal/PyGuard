  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a utility for visualizing ParallelRunStep progress in AzureML within Jupyter notebooks.\n- They confirm that the code uses AzureML SDK methods (`Run.get()`, `run_instance.get_children()`) to retrieve run and step data.\n- No external network communication, file operations, or data exfiltration is detected.\n- The code performs input validation, retries with sleep, and logs warnings via `print()`.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The only minor concern noted is the use of `print()` for warnings, which is benign but not ideal for production logging.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or close to 1), and no suspicious activity or malware is indicated.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of the code's functionality and logic**: The code correctly implements a visualization widget, with proper parameter validation and retrieval of run data.\n- **No malicious code or malware**: No signs of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, network misuse, or code injection.\n- **No obfuscation or suspicious patterns**: The code is straightforward and uses standard SDK calls.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- **Use of `print()` for warnings**: While not malicious, in production environments, this might be replaced with proper logging.\n- **Retry logic with sleep**: Standard for asynchronous data retrieval; no security issue here.\n- **Parameter validation**: Properly performed, no issues.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score**: 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score**: Given the above, a low risk score of **0.1** seems appropriate, primarily because of the use of `print()` for warnings, which is benign but not ideal.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The overall assessment indicates **no security risks or malware**.\n- The code is a legitimate utility for visualization in AzureML notebooks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, but a slight adjustment to the overall risk score to **0.1** (from 0 or 0.5) would better reflect the minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0.1** |\n\nThis reflects a clean, non-malicious utility with negligible security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, legitimate, and does not pose security threats. The minor warnings about print statements are not indicative of malicious intent. The scores should be adjusted to reflect the very low risk level.",
