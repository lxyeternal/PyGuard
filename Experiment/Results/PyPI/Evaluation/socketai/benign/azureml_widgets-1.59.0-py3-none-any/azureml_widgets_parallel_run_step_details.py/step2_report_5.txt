  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a legitimate visualization widget for AzureML parallel run steps. It performs input validation, uses Azure SDK methods, retries fetching step runs, and outputs warnings via print. No malicious behaviors or suspicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** No issues found. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on input validation, SDK calls, and benign warnings. No external network activity or malicious logic. Uses print() for warnings, which is acceptable.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** No security concerns; the code appears legitimate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports; standard SDK usage, input validation, retries, and no suspicious behavior. Warnings are via print(), which is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion; the code is a typical visualization utility with no malicious activity. Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small securityRisk (0.1) due to the use of print() warnings and retries, but these are standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent; minor concerns about logging approach.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Also consistent; standard parameter validation, Azure SDK calls, polling with sleep(), no suspicious behavior. Slightly higher securityRisk (0.1) due to the polling mechanism and print warnings.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior. The code is a straightforward visualization utility interacting with AzureML SDK, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Clear, readable code with no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low; primarily related to minor warnings and polling mechanisms, which are standard and not security risks.\n\n### Overall Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** **0** (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (minimal risk, mostly due to use of print warnings and polling, which are benign)\n\n**Final Justification:**\nThe code is a standard utility for visualization within AzureML notebooks. It performs input validation, uses well-documented SDK methods, retries to handle asynchronous data, and outputs warnings via print—nothing suspicious or malicious. The low risk score reflects the benign nature, and the malware and obfuscated scores remain at zero.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate, and free of malicious intent.",
