{
  "purpose": "The code provides a widget to visualize the progress of ParallelRunStep in Azure Machine Learning, enabling users to monitor step execution in Jupyter notebooks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to __init__ (run_instance, step_name, workspace, run_id, step_run_id); external dependencies such as azureml.core.Run, azureml.core.Workspace; method calls like Run.get() and run_instance.get_children().",
  "sinks": "None evident in the provided code; no data output or network transmission is explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated; depending on parameters, Run.get() fetches a run object; _get_step_run() retrieves specific step runs; show() visualizes the widget. Data flows from parameters to external AzureML APIs and internal methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features are present. The only noteworthy point is the retry mechanism in _get_step_run(), which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily involves parameter validation, object retrieval from Azure ML SDK, and a method to repeatedly poll for step run completion. There are no evident network transmissions, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors. The use of sleep() and print() statements are typical for polling mechanisms. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for visualizing AzureML ParallelRunStep progress within Jupyter notebooks. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It performs parameter validation, uses Azure SDK APIs securely, and contains no signs of sabotage or malware.",
