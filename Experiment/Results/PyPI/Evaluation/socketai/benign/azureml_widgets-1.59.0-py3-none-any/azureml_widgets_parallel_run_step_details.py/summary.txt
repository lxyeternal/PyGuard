  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for visualizing AzureML ParallelRunStep progress in Jupyter notebooks. It contains no malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities. The minor use of print() warnings does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to benign warnings and polling mechanisms. The code is safe for use in production environments."
