{
  "purpose": "The code defines a widget for visualizing the progress of ParallelRunStep in Azure Machine Learning within Jupyter notebooks.",
  "sources": "Inputs are received via constructor parameters (run_instance, step_name, workspace, run_id, step_run_id). The code accesses AzureML SDK methods such as Run.get() and run_instance.get_children(). It also calls time.sleep() and prints warnings.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present. The code does not send data over networks or write to external files. The print statement outputs warnings locally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and used to retrieve Run and StepRun objects. These objects are then passed to _ParallelRunStepVisualizer for rendering. No data is transmitted externally or injected into the system beyond standard SDK calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present. The code's purpose appears legitimate, focusing on UI visualization within AzureML context. The only minor concern is the print warning for multiple step runs, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code securely utilizes AzureML SDK methods to retrieve run data and visualizes progress. It performs input validation and retries when fetching step runs, ensuring robustness. There are no signs of malicious activities like data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or backdoors. The print warning is informational. No malicious or suspicious logic is identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation for visualizing parallel run steps in AzureML notebooks. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this module.",
