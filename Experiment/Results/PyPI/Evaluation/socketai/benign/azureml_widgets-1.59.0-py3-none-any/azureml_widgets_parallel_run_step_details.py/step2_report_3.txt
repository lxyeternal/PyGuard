  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present in code?** No, the code appears legitimate.\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?** None identified; the code performs standard validation and retrieval.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0. **Scores seem appropriate.**\n- **Justification for scores:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, and the security risk is minimal.\n- **Potential concerns:** The print warning about multiple step runs is benign.\n- **Overall:** Valid, legitimate code for visualization.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No, the code is straightforward.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No significant flaws; print warnings are not security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0. **Appropriate.**\n- **Justification:** No malicious logic, no external data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- **Overall:** Legitimate utility code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No, the code functions as intended.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No; standard SDK calls and validation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0. **Appropriate.**\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Overall:** Safe, standard code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No; minor concern about print warnings but benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0. **Scores are reasonable; slight security risk due to print warnings but not malicious.**\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent; the small security risk score reflects the warning mechanism.\n- **Overall:** Low risk, legitimate code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No; standard validation and polling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0. **Appropriate.**\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; polling with sleep is typical.\n- **Overall:** Safe, standard utility code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Most reports assign 0, with a few at 0.1 for minor warnings (print statements). This is reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minor concern about print warnings, but overall very low risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate utility for visualizing AzureML parallel run steps. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minor risk score reflects the use of print warnings, which is not a security concern but could be improved with logging.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the risk score at 0.1 for completeness but consider it negligible. The malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.",
