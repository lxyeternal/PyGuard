{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions for updating widget refresh times and retrieving tag values from run objects, primarily used within an Azure Machine Learning context.",
  "sources": "The code reads constants from an imported module (azureml.widgets._constants), input parameters (alpha, run), and potentially untrusted run objects or their tags.",
  "sinks": "Return values from functions based on constants and run object tags; no external data sinks, network communication, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (alpha, run) influence return values. The functions perform simple calculations or data retrieval without executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual control flow. All functions perform straightforward mathematical operations or data lookups.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of functions that perform basic arithmetic operations to adjust refresh sleep times based on a parameter 'alpha' or retrieve specific tags from run objects. Constants are imported from a module and used in calculations. The functions handle None and type checks appropriately. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to serve configuration and data retrieval purposes typical of application logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for configuration adjustments and metadata retrieval within an Azure ML environment. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The functions are straightforward and do not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
