  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The report concludes the code is standard utility functions with no malicious intent, malware, or vulnerabilities. The confidence is 1.0, malware score is 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code performs simple calculations and data retrieval with no signs of malicious activity. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with high confidence (0.95). The malware score is 0, and the analysis emphasizes the straightforward, benign nature of the code.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are identified.  \n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, with a confidence of 1. The code is benign utility functions. Malware score remains 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is thorough and aligns with the code's simplicity.  \n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous assessments, with high confidence and no malware.  \n- **Assessment:** The code is standard and safe.  \n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same conclusion: benign utility functions, no malicious activity, high confidence, malware score 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is appropriate and consistent.  \n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of my own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior; I agree with a malware score of 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear and straightforward; obfuscation score should be 0.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is benign, simple, and performs only configuration and data retrieval, the overall security risk score should be very low, close to 0, but possibly slightly above 0 due to its role in a production environment. I would assign a risk score of approximately **0.05** to reflect minimal operational risk but no security concern.\n\n### Final notes:\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The code appears safe, standard, and intended for internal configuration purposes within Azure ML.\n\n**Summary of scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** ~0.05\n\nAll reports are consistent with this assessment.",
