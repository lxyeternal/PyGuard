  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is straightforward utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0\n- **Justification:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior, these scores seem appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the reviewer notes no malicious activity, with a slightly lower confidence (0.95). The securityRisk is set at 0.1, perhaps due to cautiousness.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** The code does not perform any dangerous operations; the small securityRisk score could be a conservative estimate, but it might be slightly high given the benign nature.\n- **Recommendation:** The securityRisk score could be lowered to 0, aligning with the benign assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, no malicious behavior, straightforward utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Conclusion:** Fully aligned with the code's nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Recommendation:** Similar to Report 2, the securityRisk could be lowered to 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Slight inconsistency—some reports assign 0.1 for securityRisk, citing cautiousness, but given the benign nature, this should be 0.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The **malware** and **obfuscated** scores are correct across all reports.\n- The **securityRisk** scores should be **0** in all cases, as the code is benign and performs simple utility functions without any security implications.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard utility module with no malicious or suspicious features. The minor securityRisk scores in some reports seem overly cautious and should be adjusted to 0 for consistency.",
