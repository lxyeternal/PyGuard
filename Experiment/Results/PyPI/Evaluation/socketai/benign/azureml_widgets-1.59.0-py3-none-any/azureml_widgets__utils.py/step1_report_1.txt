{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for updating widget refresh intervals and retrieving specific tag values from a run object in Azure Machine Learning.",
  "sources": "The code reads constants imported from azureml.widgets._constants and the 'run' object passed to _get_tag_value function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit untrusted data or perform any network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code mainly computes values based on inputs and constants without external data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code appears standard and intended for internal use within Azure ML framework.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward functions to compute refresh sleep times based on alpha parameters, using constants imported from Azure ML SDK modules. The _get_tag_value function retrieves tag values from a run object, handling both dict and object with a tags attribute. There are no signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious behavior. No external network, system modification, or data exfiltration activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for Azure Machine Learning widget management and tag retrieval, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities.",
