{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for updating widget refresh times and retrieving tag values from run objects in an Azure Machine Learning context.",
  "sources": "Reading from imported constants, function parameters, and run objects' tags.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems, execute commands, or handle untrusted input that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no untrusted data flows are present that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "The functions perform simple calculations and data retrieval without suspicious or unusual behavior. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports predefined constants and uses them to calculate new refresh times based on a parameter 'alpha'. It safely handles None values and type checks. The '_get_tag_value' function retrieves tags from a run object, handling both dicts and objects with 'tags' attribute, with proper checks for None and type. No dynamic code execution, network access, or data leaks are evident. The code appears straightforward and intended for utility purposes in an ML pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It performs simple calculations and data retrieval within a controlled environment. No security risks are identified.",
