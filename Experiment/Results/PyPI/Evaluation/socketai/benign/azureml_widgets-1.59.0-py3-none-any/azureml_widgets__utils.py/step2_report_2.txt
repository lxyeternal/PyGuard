  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code provides utility functions to compute widget refresh intervals based on a parameter `alpha`, using constants imported from `azureml.widgets._constants`.\n- It also includes a function `_get_tag_value` to retrieve specific tags from a run object, handling both dicts and objects with a `tags` attribute.\n- The code appears straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or external data transmission.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  No issues are detected. The code performs simple calculations and data retrieval with proper checks.  \n  **No security or functional issues are evident.**\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in report's reasoning:**  \n  All reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and without malicious intent. They also correctly note the absence of obfuscation, external network activity, or data leaks.\n\n- **Scores assigned to malware and security risk:**  \n  All reports assign `malware` = 0 and `securityRisk` close to 0 or very low, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of scores:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, non-obfuscated code.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  The risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1). Given the code's purpose and no malicious behavior, these are reasonable.\n\n- **Confidence levels:**  \n  High confidence (1.0 or 0.95) is justified based on the clear, simple logic and absence of suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The functions perform safe arithmetic operations and handle input validation properly.\n- The `_get_tag_value` function handles both dicts and objects safely.\n- No external code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the detailed review, I agree with the assigned scores.**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a minimal, non-concerning score reflecting the code's benign nature)\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign utility module with no security risks.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.05 (even lower, considering the minimal nature of the code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated components, and poses no security risks.",
