  "purpose": "Utility functions for computing widget refresh intervals based on alpha parameter and retrieving specific tags from a run object.",
  "sources": "Constants imported from azureml.widgets._constants; run parameter in _get_tag_value",
  "sinks": "None; no external data transmission or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Input alpha parameter flows into calculation functions; run object data flows into _get_tag_value",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward calculations and data retrieval with proper checks",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple arithmetic operations to update refresh sleep times based on an alpha parameter, with default values. It also safely retrieves tags from a run object, handling both dicts and objects with a 'tags' attribute. No obfuscation, malicious code, or external network activity is present. The functions are well-structured, with input validation where necessary, and do not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward utility functions with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
