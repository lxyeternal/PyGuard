{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to update refresh sleep times for different Azure ML widgets and retrieve specific tag values from a run object.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported constants for sleep times and from the 'run' object or dictionary input to get tags.",
  "sinks": "The functions do not write or output untrusted data to external systems; they only return computed values or dictionary lookups.",
  "flows": "The functions compute sleep times based on 'alpha' and return tag values from the run object or dictionary without executing untrusted code or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The functions perform straightforward calculations and data lookups.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants related to widget refresh timings, then defines functions to interpolate these timings based on 'alpha' parameter, with default returns. The last function extracts specific tags from a run object, handling both dict and object with 'tags' attribute, including null and type checks. No untrusted input is executed; all data handling appears standard for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for managing widget refresh timings and retrieving run tags. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs simple calculations and data lookups with appropriate checks.",
