  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The functions are straightforward utility functions for computing refresh intervals and retrieving tags. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard utility functions with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe data handling, no suspicious behavior, and proper checks.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — slightly above zero, possibly reflecting minimal concern, but given the code's benign nature, this is acceptable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Comments:** The report's cautious risk score (0.1) is reasonable, though the code is clearly safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the benign nature, safe calculations, and data retrieval.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear code.\n- **Comments:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, benign utility functions, no external harmful operations.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — again, a minimal risk score for very low threat.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Comments:** The assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Clear, benign utility functions, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — transparent code.\n- **Comments:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is simple, straightforward utility functions for calculating refresh intervals and retrieving tags. No network activity, code injection, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0.0 or 0.1, which is reasonable. Given the absence of any suspicious behavior, a risk score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The code is benign and does not pose security risks.\n- The minor risk scores (0.1) are acceptable but could be uniformly set to 0.0 for consistency.\n- The malware score remains at 0, correctly reflecting the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 — no security vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a safe, standard utility module with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate, but for consistency, the risk score could be uniformly set to 0.0 across all reports.",
