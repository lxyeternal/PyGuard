  "purpose": "Render interactive HTML widgets for AzureML platform with embedded scripts and data serialization.",
  "sources": "Data attributes within the class, external CDN scripts, base64-encoded run logs, jinja2 template rendering.",
  "sinks": "Embedded JavaScript that processes data and loads widgets; potential injection if data is maliciously crafted, but unlikely given controlled data sources.",
  "flows": "Data from class attributes is serialized and encoded, then injected into HTML template; JavaScript uses this data to render widgets dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. External scripts are from trusted Azure Blob Storage URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code serializes internal data, encodes run logs in base64, converts datetime objects to ISO format, and renders an HTML template with embedded scripts that load widget components. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or insecure practices are evident. External scripts are from legitimate sources, and data handling follows standard patterns. Potential injection risks are minimal as data is controlled within the class context. Overall, the code functions as a benign widget renderer with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign widget rendering class used in AzureML environments. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal external dependency concerns but no actual vulnerabilities.",
