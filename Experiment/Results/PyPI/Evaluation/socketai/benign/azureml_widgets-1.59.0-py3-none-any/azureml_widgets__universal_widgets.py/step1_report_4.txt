  "purpose": "Define a widget class that generates HTML for displaying various run details with embedded scripts and styles.",
  "sources": "Input data from class attributes such as run_logs, run_metrics, run_id, and other run-related properties.",
  "sinks": "Embedding of data into HTML/JavaScript via Jinja2 templating, Base64 decoding of run_logs, and injection into script variables.",
  "flows": "Class attributes are assembled into a data dictionary, serialized/encoded, and injected into an HTML template, which is then rendered as HTML content.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for run_logs; dynamic JavaScript code that injects data into scripts. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for rendering HTML widgets with embedded JavaScript. It encodes run_logs in base64, converts datetime objects to ISO format, and injects data into a Jinja2 template. The scripts load external resources, configure require.js, and invoke widget rendering functions based on runType. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling observed. The external dependencies are legitimate libraries (jQuery, require.js), and data is sanitized through encoding and templating. Overall, the code appears to be a typical widget rendering class with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard widget rendering implementation for displaying run details. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The external scripts are loaded from trusted sources, and data handling appears safe. No security risks are identified.",
