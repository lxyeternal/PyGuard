  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no malicious network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** The report correctly identifies that the code serializes data, encodes run logs in base64, and loads scripts from a CDN. It states that the code is benign and typical for widget rendering.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. These seem reasonable given the benign nature described.\n- **Justification for scores:** No malware, no obfuscation, minimal security risk (perhaps due to external script dependencies). The low security risk score is justified.\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No actual malicious activity; potential concern about data injection via templates, but the data is from internal attributes, and no user input is evident.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** The concern about potential injection is valid in general, but in this context, data appears controlled.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. Slightly higher due to potential injection concerns, but overall minimal.\n- **Justification:** The risk is minimal, and no actual vulnerabilities are identified.\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No signs of malicious activity, no suspicious URLs, no obfuscation.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Correctly identifies that the code is standard for widget rendering, with safe data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious behavior, no backdoors, external scripts from trusted sources.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Recognizes standard data serialization and safe external dependencies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Correctly concludes minimal security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. I agree with **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected or claimed; scores are **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in most reports (0.1 or 0.2), justified by external dependencies and data serialization. Given the code's nature, I would keep the security risk at **0.2** for all, acknowledging minor external dependencies but no direct vulnerabilities.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The code's use of external CDN scripts is standard, but if an attacker compromised the CDN, that could introduce risk. However, there's no evidence of such here.\n- The use of base64 encoding for run logs is standard and safe.\n- No injection or malicious code execution observed.\n\n---\n\n### **Final verdict:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Score |\n|-----------------|--------------|\n| Malware         | **0**        |\n| Obfuscated      | **0**        |\n| Security Risk   | **0.2**      |\n\n**Overall, the code appears benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and minimal security risk associated with external dependencies and data handling.**",
