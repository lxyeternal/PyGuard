  "purpose": "Support for namespace packages by extending __path__ using pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "Importing 'pkgutil' and calling 'extend_path' on __path__ with __name__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> extend __path__ with __name__ -> package namespace extension.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for namespace support.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' dynamically and uses 'extend_path' to support namespace packages, a common pattern in Python packaging. No untrusted input, external communication, or malicious logic is present. The code is minimal, well-understood, and widely used. No obfuscation, suspicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified based on the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe pattern for namespace package support with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are consistent. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
