  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ to support namespace packages, enabling the package to be split across multiple distributions.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkgutil' and use of extend_path to modify __path__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data or potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> extend_path -> modify __path__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs a standard namespace package extension.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses its extend_path function to extend the __path__ variable, which is common in namespace packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is minimal, straightforward, and implements a standard pattern for namespace packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package initialization code for namespace support with no malicious intent or security risks.",
