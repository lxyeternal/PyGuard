{
  "purpose": "Transform and process metric and run data for visualization and analysis in a client-side JavaScript application.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'metrics' parameter, 'runs' list, and run object properties (such as created_utc, end_time_utc, status).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data are evident. The code primarily processes data internally and prepares it for visualization.",
  "flows": "Input data (metrics, run properties) flows through transformation functions, including _transform_run and _retransform_metrics, to produce structured dictionaries for UI consumption.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code. The code uses standard libraries and common data processing patterns. No malicious network activity, code injection, or data leaks are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a data transformation utility designed for preparing experiment metrics and run information for visualization in a web client. It utilizes standard Python libraries, handles datetime parsing and timedelta calculations securely, and performs data restructuring without executing or evaluating untrusted code. No obfuscated language features or suspicious dynamic execution is present. The only potential concern would be reliance on external data sources (like metrics and run objects), but these are typical in such applications and do not suggest malicious intent. The code's behavior is consistent with its purpose, with no signs of malicious actions or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard data transformation module with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It securely processes input data for visualization without executing untrusted code or leaking sensitive information.",
