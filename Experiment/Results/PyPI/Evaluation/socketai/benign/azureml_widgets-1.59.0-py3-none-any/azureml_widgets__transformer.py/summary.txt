  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data transformation utility with no malicious behavior or suspicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are justified and consistent with the analysis. The slight increase in security risk score in one report accounts for parsing untrusted data but does not indicate malicious intent."
