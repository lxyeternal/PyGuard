{
  "purpose": "The code is a service that transforms experiment run metrics and properties into a JavaScript-compatible format for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'metrics' parameter in 'transform_widget_metric_data', run objects in '_transform_run', and properties within run objects.",
  "sinks": "Transformed data is prepared for JavaScript visualization; no direct untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters ('metrics', 'runs', 'run' objects) through transformation functions, culminating in formatted dictionaries intended for front-end consumption.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are detected. The code predominantly performs data parsing and transformation. No suspicious dynamic code execution or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard data transformer with methods to process metric data, run durations, and run properties. It uses safe Python practices, such as parsing dates with 'dateutil.parser' and performing straightforward calculations. No external network calls, credential handling, or insecure operations are present. The use of 'math.isnan' and date parsing is standard. The only area potentially worth noting is the use of '__str__()' on datetime objects, which is safe but does not pose security issues. Overall, the code's logic aligns with typical data processing for visualization, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data transformation module for experiment metrics and run properties. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as intended for data formatting without engaging in any harmful operations.",
