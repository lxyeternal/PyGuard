  "purpose": "Transform experiment metrics and run data into formats suitable for JavaScript visualization, including handling scalar metrics, durations, and goal-based series.",
  "sources": "Metrics input data, primary metric configuration, run properties such as start/end times, created times, and run status.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures for visualization; no external sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input metrics and run properties through parsing, validation, and transformation functions into visualization-ready formats.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'parser.parse' on potentially untrusted input data, which could be risky if inputs are malicious, but common in data processing contexts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data validation, date parsing, duration calculation, and restructuring of metrics for visualization. No suspicious code patterns, network activity, or hardcoded secrets are present. The use of 'parser.parse' on untrusted data is a potential risk but is typical in such systems and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is clear, straightforward, and well-structured, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data transformation utility with no malicious behavior or suspicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are justified and consistent with the analysis. The slight increase in security risk score in one report accounts for parsing untrusted data but does not indicate malicious intent.",
