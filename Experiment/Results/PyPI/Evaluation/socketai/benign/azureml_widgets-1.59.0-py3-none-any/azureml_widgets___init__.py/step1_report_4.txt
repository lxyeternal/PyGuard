{
  "purpose": "Provide functionality for viewing machine learning training run progress in Jupyter Notebooks, supporting various Azure ML run types.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.run_details and .parallel_run_step_details), and the function _jupyter_nbextension_paths() which returns static configuration data.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to output; the function simply returns static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution. The code only returns a static data structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules and defines a function returning static configuration paths for a Jupyter Notebook extension. It includes licensing information and straightforward code. No external data handling, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated or suspicious logic. The purpose appears to be UI widget configuration for Azure ML. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module for Jupyter Notebook extensions related to Azure ML. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
