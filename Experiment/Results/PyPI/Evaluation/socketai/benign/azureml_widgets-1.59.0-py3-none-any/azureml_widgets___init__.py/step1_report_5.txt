{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality to view machine learning training run progress in Jupyter Notebooks within Azure ML context.",
  "sources": "Imports from .run_details and .parallel_run_step_details modules, and the function _jupyter_nbextension_paths.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process untrusted input or produce outputs that could leak data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow involving untrusted data is present; the code primarily defines imports and a configuration function.",
  "anomalies": "The function _jupyter_nbextension_paths() returns configuration data for Jupyter extension setup, which is standard; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines a list for exports, and includes a function that returns a configuration dictionary for a Jupyter Notebook extension. No data processing, input validation, or network operations are present. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code is straightforward and aligned with typical plugin configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module for Azure ML Jupyter extensions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides extension configuration data.",
