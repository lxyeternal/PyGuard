{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality to view the progress of machine learning training runs in Jupyter Notebooks, specifically for AzureML run types.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.run_details, .parallel_run_step_details), and the function _jupyter_nbextension_paths() which returns configuration data.",
  "sinks": "The function _jupyter_nbextension_paths() outputs configuration data that could potentially be used to load or extend notebook extensions.",
  "flows": "Imports do not process untrusted input; the function _jupyter_nbextension_paths() returns static configuration data, not influenced by external input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and standard for a plugin extension module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two local modules related to AzureML and defines a function that returns a static configuration dictionary for Jupyter Notebook extension paths. There are no dynamic data flows, external input processing, or code execution based on untrusted sources. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module for integrating AzureML widgets into Jupyter Notebooks. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
