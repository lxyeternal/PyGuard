{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality to view progress of machine learning training runs in Jupyter Notebooks within Azure ML environment.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.run_details, .parallel_run_step_details), and the function _jupyter_nbextension_paths.",
  "sinks": "The function _jupyter_nbextension_paths returns a dictionary with static resource paths and extension require path; no untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external or untrusted sources to sinks. The code simply returns static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and involves only standard module imports and a static return function.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules related to Azure ML run details, defines a function that returns static path configuration for Jupyter Notebook extension integration. No user input, environment variables, or external data is processed or transmitted. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module intended for setting up notebook extension paths related to Azure ML. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
