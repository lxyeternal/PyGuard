  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Anomalies:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, static, and involves only module imports and a simple function returning configuration data.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, external data processing, or network activity.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Code Functionality and Logic:**\n   - The code's purpose is to provide configuration paths for a Jupyter Notebook extension related to AzureML.\n   - The function `_jupyter_nbextension_paths()` returns a static dictionary with resource paths and extension requirements.\n   - The code does not process untrusted input, perform any data transformation, or communicate externally.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since the code does not introduce any security risks.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and configuration-oriented.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is static and non-executable beyond returning a dictionary.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, standard configuration module for Jupyter Notebook extensions related to AzureML. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is safe, straightforward, and serves a specific configuration purpose without any security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
