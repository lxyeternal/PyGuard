  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, importing internal modules and returning static configuration data.\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are detected in the code snippets.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of untrusted data processing, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n   - No logical flaws or inaccuracies are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1.0), which is appropriate given the clear and straightforward analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, no justification is necessary. The code is benign.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n   - The code only returns static configuration data and performs no malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - No claims based on assumptions are present; all analyses are consistent with the code's actual behavior.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is purely configuration and utility functions for AzureML Jupyter Notebook extensions.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present.\n- The provided scores are accurate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**Final note:**\nAll reports are correct in their benign assessment. The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
