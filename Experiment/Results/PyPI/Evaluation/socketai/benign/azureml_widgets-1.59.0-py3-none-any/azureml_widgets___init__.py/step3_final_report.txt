  "purpose": "Provides static configuration paths for a Jupyter Notebook extension related to AzureML widgets.",
  "sources": "The function _jupyter_nbextension_paths() returns a static dictionary; no external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only returns static configuration data.",
  "flows": "The function outputs a static dictionary; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules related to AzureML run details and defines a function that returns static configuration data for a Jupyter Notebook extension. It performs no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code's purpose is benign, serving as configuration for extension setup. All signals indicate a safe, non-malicious utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static configuration code with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no obfuscation, no external data handling, and performs only a simple return of static data. The scores are appropriate and consistent with its benign nature.",
