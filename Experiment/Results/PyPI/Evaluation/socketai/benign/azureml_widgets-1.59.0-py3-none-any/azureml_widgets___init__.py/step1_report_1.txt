{
  "purpose": "The code provides functionality to view the progress of machine learning training runs in Jupyter Notebooks, specifically for AzureML.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.run_details, .parallel_run_step_details), no external input sources or data reading functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the function _jupyter_nbextension_paths() returns static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code observed. The code is straightforward and contains no obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules related to AzureML run details and defines a function that returns static configuration data for a Jupyter Notebook extension. There are no input reads, no processing of untrusted data, and no network activity. The code appears to be standard configuration or utility code for an extension, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as configuration and utility functions for Jupyter Notebook extensions related to AzureML. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
