  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code logic, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n**Summary of Findings Across Reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a telemetry logging helper for AzureML, with conditional imports and fallback mechanisms.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are identified.\n- The code interacts with external telemetry services, which is standard for such utilities.\n- The malware scores are consistently zero, reflecting no malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1-0.2), indicating minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Potential Issues:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description—helper classes for telemetry logging, with optional AzureML modules.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no network connections, code injection, or data exfiltration routines.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Hardcoded secrets:** Absent.\n- **Suspicious logic:** No suspicious logic or assumptions.\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** Correctly assigned as 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0, no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero, reflecting that it interacts with external telemetry services but is standard practice.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- The reports' assessments are consistent and reasonable.\n- The use of try-except for optional module import is standard and not suspicious.\n- The code's purpose is legitimate, and no signs of malicious intent are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, primarily due to external telemetry interaction, which is typical and not inherently risky.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nGiven the comprehensive review, I see no reason to adjust the scores. The code appears to be a standard telemetry utility with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                 | No malicious behavior detected                              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                 | Clear, straightforward code                                  |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1               | External telemetry interaction; standard practice           |\n\nThis detailed review confirms the code's benign nature and appropriate scoring.",
