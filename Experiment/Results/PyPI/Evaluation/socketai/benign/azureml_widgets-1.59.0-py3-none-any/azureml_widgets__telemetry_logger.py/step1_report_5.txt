{
  "purpose": "Provides telemetry logging capabilities with optional AzureML telemetry integration, including activity logging and custom log handlers.",
  "sources": "Imports from azureml.telemetry modules, environment variable checks (via import), and logger creation functions.",
  "sinks": "Logger handlers such as AppInsightsLoggingHandler, and telemetry activity functions.",
  "flows": "Imports lead to telemetry handler setup; get_telemetry_logger sets up logging; log_activity wraps telemetry activity logging, passing data to external AzureML telemetry services.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Uses standard logging and conditional imports. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up telemetry logging using AzureML's telemetry SDK, with fallback for import errors. It creates loggers, adds handlers if available, and wraps telemetry activity logging functions. No external data inputs are handled insecurely. The code is well-structured and utilizes standard practices for optional SDK features. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of external telemetry modules appears to be intended for usage within legitimate AzureML workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard telemetry helper module with no signs of malicious behavior. It conditionally uses AzureML telemetry services for activity logging and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code components.",
