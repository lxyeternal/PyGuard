  "purpose": "Telemetry logger helper class for AzureML, facilitating activity logging and handling optional telemetry modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from azureml.telemetry modules, logger creation, handler addition, and activity logging functions.",
  "sinks": "External telemetry handlers, logger handlers, and activity logging calls; no data leaks or untrusted data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Initialization and import -> logger setup -> optional handler addition -> activity logging via wrapper functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard try-except for optional modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard telemetry utility for AzureML, managing optional dependencies, setting up loggers, and wrapping activity logs. It does not perform network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious actions. No obfuscation or suspicious logic is present. The fallback null context manager ensures safe operation if telemetry modules are missing. Overall, the code is benign, purpose-specific, and adheres to safe coding practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate telemetry helper with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.15-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
