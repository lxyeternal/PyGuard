{
  "purpose": "The code implements a widget system for visualizing Azure Machine Learning run details across different platforms like Jupyter and Databricks, dynamically importing appropriate modules based on run type.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module for dynamic module loading, run_instance.get_properties() for retrieving run metadata",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; the code does not directly process untrusted input or write sensitive data to untrusted destinations",
  "flows": "run_instance.type or run_instance.get_properties() -> widget_mapper lookup -> dynamic import and class instantiation",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import via importlib.import_module; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code. The dynamic import pattern could be misused to load malicious modules if module names are manipulated externally, but here it is constructed internally based on run type.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports modules for different run types using importlib, which could pose a risk if the module names are influenced by untrusted sources. However, in this context, the module names are constructed internally with fixed strings ('hyperdrive', 'automl', etc.), reducing the risk. The code does not execute or evaluate untrusted data directly; it mainly performs class lookups and instantiations. The rest of the code consists of class and method definitions with no active behavior or code execution. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected. The dynamic import pattern, while potentially dangerous if misused, appears safe here due to fixed module name patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe, standard implementation for dynamically loading widget classes based on run type. There are no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The only minor concern is the use of dynamic import which, in a different context, could be exploited, but here it is controlled and based on internal strings.",
