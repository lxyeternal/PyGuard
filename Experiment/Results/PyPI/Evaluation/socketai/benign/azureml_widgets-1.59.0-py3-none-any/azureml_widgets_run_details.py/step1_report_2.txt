{
  "purpose": "Provides a widget interface for visualizing Azure Machine Learning run details in Jupyter notebooks and other environments.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module for dynamic module import; run_instance.get_properties and run_instance.type for run metadata; class references via getattr.",
  "sinks": "Potential dynamic import and attribute access could lead to code execution if module or class names are controlled, but here they are hardcoded and constructed internally.",
  "flows": "Dynamic import via '_create_rundetails_importer' returns a function that, when called, imports a module and retrieves a class; class instantiation with run_instance data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import with variable strings (run_type) could be suspicious in other contexts, but here the strings are predefined. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a widget system for different Azure ML run types, using dynamic imports based on run type identifiers. The import paths are constructed from static strings and do not incorporate external user input, reducing risk. The module import and class retrieval are performed securely with assertions. No evidence of malicious behaviors such as network activity, file manipulation, or data exfiltration. The code seems intended for a legitimate SDK purpose, with standard patterns for plugin-like dynamic loading. The only potential concern is the dynamic import, but given the controlled context, it does not pose a malicious risk. The code does not contain any backdoors, network activity, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SDK component for rendering ML run details with safe dynamic module loading. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected. The use of dynamic imports is controlled and does not appear malicious.",
