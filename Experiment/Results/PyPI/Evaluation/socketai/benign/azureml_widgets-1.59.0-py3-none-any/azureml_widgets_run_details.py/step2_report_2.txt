  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the security implications, correctness, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Explains the widget creation system based on run types, with dynamic import.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Dynamic import via importlib, based on run_type; no malicious code.\n- **Flow:** Controlled, internal strings for module paths; assertions for sanity.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of dynamic import with controlled strings; assertions instead of exceptions.\n- **Analysis:** The dynamic import is constructed from internal, predefined strings derived from run_instance properties, not external input. No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard plugin pattern, minimal risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.2) is justified; malware score is correctly 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Widget interface for Azure ML run details, with dynamic import.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** importlib.import_module; controlled class references.\n- **Flow:** Similar to report 1, controlled strings.\n- **Anomalies:** Dynamic import based on run_type, but run_type is derived from run_instance properties.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, standard pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, controlled dynamic import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** The minimal security risk is justified; malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar widget system, dynamic import based on run_type.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** importlib.import_module; run_instance properties.\n- **Flow:** Same pattern.\n- **Anomalies:** Dynamic import with controlled strings.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, safe for intended use.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The risk scores are justified; no malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Widget system with dynamic module loading.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** importlib.import_module; run_instance properties.\n- **Flow:** Same as others.\n- **Anomalies:** Controlled dynamic import.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; dynamic import is safe given the fixed strings.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar widget system, dynamic import based on run_type.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Same as above.\n- **Flow:** Same pattern.\n- **Anomalies:** Controlled dynamic import.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting minor concerns about dynamic import but controlled strings. These are reasonable given the context.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- The code relies on controlled, internal strings for dynamic imports, which are derived from run_instance properties, reducing the attack surface.\n- There are no signs of backdoors, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n- The use of assertions instead of exception handling is a minor concern but does not affect security directly.\n- The dynamic import pattern is standard for plugin architectures and appears safe here.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (minimal, controlled dynamic import, no external input exploitation)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe within its context, with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain risks.",
