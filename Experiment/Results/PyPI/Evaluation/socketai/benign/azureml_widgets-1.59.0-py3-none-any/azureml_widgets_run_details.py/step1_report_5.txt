  "purpose": "The code implements a widget system for visualizing Azure ML run details within Jupyter notebooks or Databricks environments.",
  "sources": "Imports from importlib, azureml.widgets._telemetry_logger, and _platform modules; dynamic import via importlib.import_module; run_instance properties.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly observed; no data output or network transmission functions present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from run_instance properties and get_properties() method to determine run_type, then potentially dynamic import of specific widget classes based on run_type, and finally instantiation of those classes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import (_create_rundetails_importer) which loads modules based on runtime parameters; no hardcoded secrets; no obfuscated code; code assertions for class references. No suspicious backdoors or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles dynamic module loading for different run types to instantiate appropriate widget classes. It uses runtime properties to determine which widget to load, and has a fallback to a default widget class (_UserRunDetails). No data is transmitted externally, nor are any system commands or network calls present. The dynamic import function could potentially load malicious modules if the run_type is manipulated; however, in normal operation, module names are constructed from known strings and the import targets are within the package scope. The code does not include any suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication. No obfuscation or malware signatures are evident. The code is well-structured, with clear intentions, and does not perform any harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a widget system for Azure ML run visualization, with dynamic import logic to load specific widget classes based on run type. No malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks are identified within this code segment. The dynamic import could pose a risk if exploited, but this is unlikely in a controlled environment.",
