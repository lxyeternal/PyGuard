  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates a controlled, standard plugin pattern for loading run-specific widgets in AzureML. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The dynamic import pattern, while inherently risky if inputs are untrusted, is safe here due to reliance on internal, controlled properties. The risk is minimal, and the implementation aligns with best practices for extensibility in SDKs."
