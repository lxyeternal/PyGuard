  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code consists solely of constant definitions related to widget refresh times and module names.\n   - There are no executable functions, dynamic code, or logic that could introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n   - The constants seem straightforward and are used for configuration purposes.\n\n2. **Report Content Review:**\n   - All five reports contain only the message \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.\n   - There is no detailed explanation, code snippets, or evidence of issues.\n   - This lack of information makes it impossible to verify if any issues are present or to assess the validity of the reports.\n\n3. **Assessment of Report Validity:**\n   - Since the reports do not contain any details or evidence, they cannot be confirmed as valid security issues.\n   - The \"Empty response\" message might indicate a failure in reporting or an absence of actual issues.\n\n4. **Error, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are essentially empty and do not provide actionable information.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors can be identified due to lack of content.\n\n5. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - Without concrete evidence, assigning high malware or risk scores would be unjustified.\n   - The absence of any malicious activity or vulnerabilities in the code suggests that scores should be very low or zero.\n   - The \"malware\" score should be 0, as there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n   - The \"obfuscated\" score should also be 0, given the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The \"risk\" score should be minimal, likely 0 or very close to it, since no issues are demonstrated.\n\n6. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - If these reports are placeholders or incomplete, it might be worth flagging for further investigation.\n   - But based solely on the provided data, no security risk is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Analysis:** No issues or malicious activity present.\n- **Report Validity:** No actionable information; reports are empty.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware Score:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n  - **Risk Score:** 0\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Request more detailed reports or evidence if further investigation is needed.\n- No immediate security concerns based on current data.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports do not provide any evidence of issues, and the code itself is benign. The scores should reflect this, with all being zero or near-zero.",
