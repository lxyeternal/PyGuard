  "purpose": "Constants related to widget refresh timings and module identification for AzureML widgets.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources; only predefined constants.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; constants are used internally for configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and contains only constants.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple set of constant definitions with no executable logic, dynamic code, or embedded data. The reports provided are all 'Empty response' with no additional details, making it impossible to identify any vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or security issues. The code does not contain obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious activity. Given the lack of evidence, the scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should be zero. The reports do not provide any actionable information or indications of issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or security-compromising elements. The reports are empty and do not suggest any vulnerabilities or malicious activity. Therefore, the overall security risk, malware likelihood, and obfuscation are all effectively zero.",
