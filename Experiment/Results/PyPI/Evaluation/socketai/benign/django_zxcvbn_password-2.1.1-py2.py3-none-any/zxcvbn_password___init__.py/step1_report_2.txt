{
  "purpose": "Defines and exports password validation classes and functions for a Django application, integrating ZXCVBN password strength measurement.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external libraries (zxcvbn_password.fields and zxcvbn_password.validators)",
  "sinks": "None observed; no handling of untrusted data, no network or file operations",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only imports and exports classes/functions without processing external data",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, a module docstring, and an __all__ declaration for exporting specific components. It imports classes and functions from external password validation libraries and exposes them for use elsewhere. There are no data flows, network operations, or data handling that could be exploited. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup for password validation in a Django project. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and appears to be a standard, safe configuration file.",
