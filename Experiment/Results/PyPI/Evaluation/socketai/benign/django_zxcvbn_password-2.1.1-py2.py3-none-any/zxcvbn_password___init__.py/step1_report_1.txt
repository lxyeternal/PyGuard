{
  "purpose": "This package provides password validation functionality using ZXCVBN for Django projects, both on front-end (JavaScript) and back-end (Python).",
  "sources": "Imports from 'zxcvbn_password.fields' and 'zxcvbn_password.validators'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data processing, no data leaks, or malicious code execution points are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports modules and defines an export list without processing or executing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The code is straightforward and standard for a package module.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module declaration with imports from a third-party library 'zxcvbn_password'. It includes a module docstring explaining its purpose and an '__all__' list specifying exported objects. There are no inputs, data processing, or potential attack vectors present. No signs of malicious behavior or suspicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, well-structured module declaration that imports specific password validation classes and functions for use elsewhere. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. The code appears safe and typical for a Python package interface.",
