  "purpose": "To provide password validation functionality using zxcvbn in a Django project, supporting front-end and back-end validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from zxcvbn_password.fields and zxcvbn_password.validators modules, which are external dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None evident in the provided code; no handling of untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code mainly defines imports and module exports without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes and functions from external zxcvbn-based password validation packages and exposes them via __all__. There are no data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. It does not include any source of untrusted data or any sinks where data is sent or stored. The code appears to be a typical Python module setup for a Django password validation package, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as an interface to password validation functionalities, and does not contain malicious behavior or security issues. No anomalies or malware indicators are present.",
