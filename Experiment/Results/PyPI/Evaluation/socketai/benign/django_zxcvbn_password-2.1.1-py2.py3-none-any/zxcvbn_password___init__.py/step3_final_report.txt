  "purpose": "Provides password validation classes and functions for Django using ZXCVBN.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'zxcvbn_password' package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Imports from external library, then exports via __all__; no data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal interface module that imports specific classes and functions for password validation and exposes them. It contains no data processing, network operations, or dynamic execution. All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard module setup for a Django password validation package, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity. The assessments and scores are accurate and do not require adjustment.",
