  "purpose": "To provide password validation functionality using the zxcvbn library for both frontend and backend in a Django project.",
  "sources": "Imports from zxcvbn_password.fields and zxcvbn_password.validators modules, as well as the utf-8 encoding declaration.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or sensitive operations are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports specific classes and functions for password validation but does not process any input data within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code primarily consists of imports and module metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports password validation classes and functions from the zxcvbn_password package. It defines the module's public interface via __all__ and includes a descriptive comment. There are no input handling, data processing, or network operations. The use of future import is standard for Python 2/3 compatibility. No malicious patterns, code injection, or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module setup for password validation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
