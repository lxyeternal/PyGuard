  "purpose": "The code defines a Django package for password validation using the ZXCVBN algorithm, providing fields and validators for password strength checking.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'zxcvbn_password.fields' and 'zxcvbn_password.validators'. No external input sources or data reads are present in the code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes and functions related to password validation but does not execute any logic or data flow; it mainly sets up exports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The code appears to be a straightforward module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports password-related classes and validators from a package, declares all exports, and includes a descriptive comment. There is no dynamic execution, data processing, or external communication. It is a typical setup module for Django password validation functionality. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup module for Django password validation using ZXCVBN. It does not contain any malicious code, obfuscated parts, or security risks based on the provided content.",
