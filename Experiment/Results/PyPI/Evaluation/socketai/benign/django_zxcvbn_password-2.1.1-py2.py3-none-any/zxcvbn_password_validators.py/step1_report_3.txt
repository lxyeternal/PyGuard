  "purpose": "Validation of password strength using the zxcvbn library within Django forms.",
  "sources": "User attributes ('username', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'email') extracted from user object; password input.",
  "sinks": "zxcvbn function analysis, raising ValidationError with feedback messages.",
  "flows": "Password input -> zxcvbn analysis -> feedback extraction -> potential ValidationError raised.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. Usage of third-party library is legitimate for password strength validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to validate password strength with configurable minimum score and user attributes, using the zxcvbn library. It ensures password security by checking the strength score and providing user feedback. No dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior detected. All code appears to serve its intended purpose without suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate password validator employing zxcvbn, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
