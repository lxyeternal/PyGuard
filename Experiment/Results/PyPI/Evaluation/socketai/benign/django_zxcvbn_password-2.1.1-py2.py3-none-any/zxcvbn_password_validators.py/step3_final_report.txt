  "purpose": "Password validation using zxcvbn to assess strength and provide feedback.",
  "sources": "User attributes (username, first_name, last_name, email), password input, optional frequency_lists parameter.",
  "sinks": "ValidationError raised with feedback messages; no data transmission or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input password and user attributes flow into zxcvbn evaluation; feedback triggers ValidationError if weak.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; use of add_frequency_lists is standard for customization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django password validator leveraging zxcvbn. It reads user attributes, evaluates password strength, and raises ValidationError with feedback. No malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation detected. The call to add_frequency_lists is optional and does not introduce security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure password validator with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified by external library use and optional configuration but does not pose a threat. The existing scores are appropriate and should be maintained.",
