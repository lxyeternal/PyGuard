{
  "purpose": "Define custom Django form widgets for password input with strength indication and confirmation features.",
  "sources": "Uses 'zxcvbn_min_score()' from utils to determine minimum password strength; reads 'class' attribute from attrs; reads translation strings.",
  "sinks": "Render method outputs HTML with embedded JavaScript references; uses mark_safe to output HTML directly; no untrusted data directly used in code.",
  "flows": "Calls zxcvbn_min_score() to determine min score; formats HTML with labels and embedded scripts; renders HTML including strength bar and confirmation message.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Usage of translation functions and dynamic HTML formatting are standard. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily creates Django form widgets for password input, with visual indicators of password strength and confirmation. It utilizes external JavaScript files for strength evaluation. No external inputs are directly used in sensitive operations. The code handles HTML rendering safely with mark_safe, and dynamic data is confined to presentation labels and attributes. No signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or sabotage are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for enhancing password input UI elements in Django forms. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The logic is straightforward, focusing on user experience rather than security vulnerabilities or malicious activities.",
