{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom Django form widgets for password input with strength validation and confirmation features, primarily for use in user registration or password change forms.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from form input fields ('name', 'value', 'attrs'). It also retrieves a minimum score value from the utils module via 'zxcvbn_min_score()'.",
  "sinks": "Generated HTML markup and embedded JavaScript references; no direct data sinks or network connections are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input fields into the render methods, which generate dynamic HTML content with embedded markup and JavaScript references. No untrusted data is used in dangerous operations such as system calls or network connections.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. Usage of gettext for translations and inclusion of external JS files are standard for Django widgets.",
  "analysis": "The code creates custom password widgets with visual strength indicators and confirmation prompts. It calls an external utility 'zxcvbn_min_score()' to determine password strength thresholds, and includes references to local static JavaScript files for functionality. The HTML markup is static and only displays warnings or progress bars. There are no dynamic system calls, no eval, exec, or other code execution features, and no network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms. All data flows are limited to form rendering without handling sensitive data in insecure ways. No obfuscated code or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, well-structured Django form widgets for password validation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It follows standard practices, and no malware or security risks are evident in this snippet.",
