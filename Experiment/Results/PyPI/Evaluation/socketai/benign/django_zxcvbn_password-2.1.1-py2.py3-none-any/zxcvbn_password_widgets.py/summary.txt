  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and does not pose security or malware risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects minimal concern, primarily due to the use of mark_safe and external JS assets, which are standard in such UI components."
