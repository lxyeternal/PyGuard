  "purpose": "Provide custom Django form widgets for password strength indication and password confirmation with enhanced user interface features.",
  "sources": "getters for zxcvbn_min_score(), django.utils.translation.gettext, django.forms.PasswordInput.render, self.attrs dictionary, external JS files.",
  "sinks": "None directly, as data outputs are primarily HTML markup and JavaScript references.",
  "flows": "Input values (passwords) flow through render methods, resulting in safe HTML outputs combined with external JavaScript for password strength validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network calls; external JavaScript files loaded are typical for password strength meters; no obfuscated code; no suspicious data leakage or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Django form widgets: PasswordStrengthInput and PasswordConfirmationInput, both inheriting from PasswordInput. These widgets enhance user experience by providing visual feedback on password strength and confirmation matching. The render methods generate HTML markup with embedded progress bars and warning messages, incorporating localized strings. The zxcvbn_min_score() function is used to retrieve a minimum password strength score, but its implementation is external and assumed safe. No dynamic execution, code injection, or network activity occurs within this code. External JS files are standard for such widgets. The code does not handle sensitive data insecurely, nor does it contain hidden or malicious logic. Overall, it appears to be a straightforward UI enhancement component with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign implementation of password strength and confirmation UI widgets in Django. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious network activity, or security vulnerabilities. The code is well-structured for its purpose, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
