{
  "purpose": "Provides Django form widgets for password strength indication and confirmation, enhancing user experience during password input.",
  "sources": "Reads static strings, external utility function zxcvbn_min_score(), and form input values.",
  "sinks": "Outputs HTML with embedded JavaScript references; no untrusted data processed in a dangerous manner.",
  "flows": "Form input values are rendered with additional HTML and JavaScript for client-side password validation; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of mark_safe is controlled and standard for rendering HTML snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Django widgets for password strength and confirmation, utilizing external JS assets and translation functions. No malicious logic, network activity, or data leakage is present. The code is straightforward, readable, and follows best practices. External JS files are typical for password strength meters. The use of mark_safe is appropriate given the controlled HTML content. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and does not pose security or malware risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects minimal concern, primarily due to the use of mark_safe and external JS assets, which are standard in such UI components.",
