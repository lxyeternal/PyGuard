{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom Django form widgets for password input fields, including password strength display and confirmation functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the widget attributes, such as 'name', 'value', and 'attrs'. It also imports utility functions like 'zxcvbn_min_score'. It does not process external untrusted data directly.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs HTML markup using 'mark_safe' and incorporates localized strings. It does not directly write to files, send data over the network, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Input values ('name', 'value', 'attrs') flow through the 'render' methods, leading to HTML markup generation. No external data flows into network or file systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. Usage of 'mark_safe' is standard for rendering safe HTML, with no indications of malicious content injection. No suspicious domain connections, reverse shells, or data theft code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Django form widgets for password fields with added UI features. It uses standard Django mechanisms, localizes messages, and includes necessary JavaScript files for client-side functionality. No external data processing, network communication, or system modification code is present. 'mark_safe' is used appropriately to inject HTML markup. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to password input enhancement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom password input widgets for Django forms. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The use of 'mark_safe' is appropriate given the context. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
