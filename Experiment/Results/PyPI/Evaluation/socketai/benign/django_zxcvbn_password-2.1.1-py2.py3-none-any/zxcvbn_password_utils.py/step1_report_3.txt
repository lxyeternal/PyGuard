  "purpose": "Retrieve and determine the minimum score setting for the ZXCVBN password validator from Django settings.",
  "sources": "Reading 'AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS' from Django settings; accessing validator dictionary keys.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code only reads data from settings and constants.",
  "flows": "Iterates through validators to find a specific validator and extract its 'min_score' option, defaults if not found.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code dynamically reads configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code inspects Django's password validation settings to locate a specific password validator and extract its 'min_score' option. It handles the case where the validator is absent by defaulting to a predefined constant. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious data handling. The code performs straightforward configuration retrieval and type conversion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration utility function with no malicious behavior or security risks. It merely accesses and processes settings data to determine a password strength requirement.",
