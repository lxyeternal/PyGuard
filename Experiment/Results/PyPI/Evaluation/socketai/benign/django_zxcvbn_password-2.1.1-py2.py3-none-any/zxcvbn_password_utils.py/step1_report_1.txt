  "purpose": "Retrieve the minimum score setting for the zxcvbn password validator from Django settings.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'settings.AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS' and 'validator['NAME']' and 'validator.get()' for 'OPTIONS' and 'min_score'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement converting 'zxcvbn_min_score' to int, no external data sinks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Loop through validators to find specific validator, then get 'min_score' option, finally return as integer.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of standard Django settings access. No obfuscation or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code safely accesses Django settings to find a specific password validator and retrieves its 'min_score' parameter, defaulting if not found. No external data manipulation, no system calls, no suspicious logic. The code performs a straightforward configuration retrieval. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. No security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration utility for password validation settings. No malicious intent or suspicious activity detected.",
