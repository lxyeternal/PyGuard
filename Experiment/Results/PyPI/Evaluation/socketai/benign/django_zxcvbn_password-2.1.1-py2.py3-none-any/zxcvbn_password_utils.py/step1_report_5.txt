  "purpose": "This code retrieves the minimum score setting for a password validator from Django settings, specifically looking for a zxcvbn_password.ZXCVBNValidator entry.",
  "sources": "Reads from settings.AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS to find a specific validator configuration.",
  "sinks": "Returns an integer value representing the minimum score; no data is written or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Extracts validator info from settings, then retrieves 'min_score' from validator options or defaults.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code safely accesses application settings, searches for a specific validator configuration, and returns a score value. It uses standard dictionary access patterns and defaults if not found. There are no external calls, no data leakage, and no suspicious logic involved.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward configuration retrieval function with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply extracts a setting value for password validation.",
