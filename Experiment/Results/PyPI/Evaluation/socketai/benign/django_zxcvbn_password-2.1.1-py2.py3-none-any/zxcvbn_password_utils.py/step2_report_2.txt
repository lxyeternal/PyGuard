  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward retrieval of password validator configuration from Django settings.\n- No external data flows, network calls, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present.\n- The code's purpose is to locate a specific validator and get its 'min_score' parameter, defaulting if necessary.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any vulnerabilities, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- The logic is simple, transparent, and safe.\n- The assumption that the code could be malicious is unfounded based on the provided information.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Malware score: 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- Security risk score: 0, since the code is safe and standard.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign configuration utility with no security concerns.",
