  "purpose": "Defines custom Django form fields for password input and confirmation, utilizing Django's password validation framework and external widgets for UI.",
  "sources": "User input via form fields; validation functions (validate_password); external widget classes for rendering.",
  "sinks": "Validation functions (validate_password) that process user input; widget rendering for UI.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> validate_password validation -> widget rendering; no external data leaks or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Django password fields with validation and custom widgets. It relies on Django's established password validation and external widgets from a reputable package. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The external widget classes are for UI enhancement and do not introduce security risks. The data flow is local, with no external network activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation of password input and confirmation fields in Django, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
