{
  "purpose": "This code provides custom Django form fields for password input and confirmation with integrated validation and custom widgets.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the user via form fields 'PasswordField' and 'PasswordConfirmationField'. It also imports password validation functions from Django and custom widgets from zxcvbn_password.widgets.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily validates password input using Django's validate_password, which can perform security checks but does not directly lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No other sinks like network communication or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "User input flows into 'PasswordField' or 'PasswordConfirmationField', which then invoke validators and widgets. The validation process is local; there are no data flows to external systems or insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard Django practices for form fields, validation, and widget assignment. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom form fields for password input, utilizing Django's validation framework and custom widgets for UI. It performs password validation locally through Django's 'validate_password', which applies configured validators. The initialization of widgets is conditional and uses common patterns. There are no external data transmissions, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code behaviors. Overall, it appears to be standard, secure form handling code with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of secure password fields for Django forms, utilizing standard validation and widget customization. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It appears safe and intentional.",
