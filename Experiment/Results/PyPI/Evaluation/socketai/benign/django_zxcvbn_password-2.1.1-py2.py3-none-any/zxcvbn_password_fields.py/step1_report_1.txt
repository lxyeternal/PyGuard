  "purpose": "Define custom Django form fields for password input and confirmation with integrated password validation and strength widgets.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; input sources would be from form data submitted by users.",
  "sinks": "Validation functions and widget rendering, primarily for password strength validation and user input handling.",
  "flows": "User submits form -> data flows into PasswordField or PasswordConfirmationField -> validation and widget rendering occur.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. No unusual behavior or obfuscation. Usage of external password validation and widget classes is standard for Django forms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two form fields for passwords with validation and UI widgets, utilizing Django's validation framework and external widget components. No untrusted data sources or dangerous sinks are present. The validator uses Django's established password validation, and widget classes are imported externally, with no indication of malicious behavior. The code appears to follow standard patterns for secure password input handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Django form field definitions for password input and confirmation, with proper validation integration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues within this code segment.",
