  "purpose": "This code defines custom Django form fields for password input and confirmation, including validation logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration and validation functions from Django modules, and widget classes from zxcvbn_password.widgets.",
  "sinks": "Validation functions and widget rendering may process user input; no direct sink for untrusted data is evident, but validation is performed on input.",
  "flows": "User inputs passwords into the form fields; the validate_password function validates password strength; widgets display input fields.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior are present. The code uses standard Django validation and custom widgets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines password and confirmation form fields with validation and custom widgets. It leverages Django's password validation and external widget classes. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are observed, and the data flow is typical for password input handling. The code appears secure and standard for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of password fields with validation and custom widgets. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
