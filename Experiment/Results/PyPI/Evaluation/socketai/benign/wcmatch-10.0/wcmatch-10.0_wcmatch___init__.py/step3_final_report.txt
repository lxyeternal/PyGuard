  "purpose": "Minimal module that imports version metadata from __meta__ for a package related to wildcard matching.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing __version_info__ and __version__ from __meta__.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "None; code only imports metadata, no data processing or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import of version information, with a descriptive comment indicating functionality related to wildcard matching. There are no functions, data handling, or network operations. The code's simplicity and transparency indicate no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The import statement and comments are standard for package metadata setup. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscation to 0, and security risk to 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
