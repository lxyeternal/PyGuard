  "purpose": "Provides custom implementations of `fnmatch` and `glob` for pattern matching in file paths.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local module `.__meta__` to access version information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow observed in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a brief module docstring and an import statement for version info from a local meta module. It does not perform any operations, data processing, or I/O, and there are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or malicious behavior. The import is standard for version tracking and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module header with a version import, with no malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
