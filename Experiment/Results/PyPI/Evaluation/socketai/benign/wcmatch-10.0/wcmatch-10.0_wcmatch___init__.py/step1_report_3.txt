  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment describing functionality and an import statement for version info from a local module. There are no executable functions, no handling of external inputs, and no suspicious behavior. The import appears to be for metadata purposes only, with no malicious activity or obfuscation evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, providing metadata and documentation comments without any malicious intent or security risks.",
