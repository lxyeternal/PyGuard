{
  "purpose": "The code provides a custom implementation of wildcard matching functions similar to `fnmatch` and `glob`.",
  "sources": "Imports metadata variables from a local module (`.__meta__`), which may contain version information.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or security-sensitive operations are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing metadata; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are detected. The comment suggests the module implements filename matching functions but does not include implementation details.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports metadata variables from a local module, which is a common practice for versioning and does not indicate malicious intent. There are no active functions, data handling, or network operations. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or potentially malicious constructs. The snippet is minimal and appears legitimate for a utility module.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears benign. It is a simple import statement for version metadata, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
