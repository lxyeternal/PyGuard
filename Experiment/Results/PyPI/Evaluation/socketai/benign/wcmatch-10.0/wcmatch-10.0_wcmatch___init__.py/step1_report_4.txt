{
  "purpose": "Implementing custom wildcard matching functions similar to fnmatch and glob.",
  "sources": "Import from a local module __meta__ that provides version information.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data flows related to untrusted data processing are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink observed; the code only imports version info.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no apparent anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version metadata from a local module, indicating a modular design. It mentions implementing wildcard matching functions, but no actual implementation is shown. No external data input, network operations, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be a simple, benign module header with import statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected based on the provided snippet.",
