{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a module for wildcard matching, providing custom implementations similar to `fnmatch` and `glob`.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing `__version_info__` and `__version__` from a local module `__meta__`.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports metadata attributes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code's sole function is to import versioning information from a relative module. There are no functions, data processing, or network operations present. This is typical for a package's `__init__.py` or module metadata setup. No unusual code or malicious behavior is detected in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module initialization snippet, providing metadata information about the package. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
