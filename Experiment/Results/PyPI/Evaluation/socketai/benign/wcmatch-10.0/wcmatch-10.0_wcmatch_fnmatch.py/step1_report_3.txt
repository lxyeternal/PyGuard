  "purpose": "Implementing custom wildcard pattern matching functions similar to fnmatch, with extended features and flag controls.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, relative import of _wcparse module, and function parameters for patterns and filenames.",
  "sinks": "Calls to _wcparse functions such as translate, compile, escape, and is_magic, which process patterns and filenames.",
  "flows": "Pattern input flows into functions like translate, fnmatch, filter, escape, and is_magic; then into corresponding _wcparse functions for processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No use of dangerous functions such as exec, eval, or system calls. No obfuscated code or suspicious variable names. Usage of relative import may indicate internal module reliance but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a wrapper around an imported module _wcparse, providing pattern matching functionalities similar to fnmatch with extended options. Functions transform flags, handle pattern inputs, and delegate core matching logic to _wcparse. No user input is directly executed or transmitted. The _wcparse module is external, so its implementation details are unknown, but based on usage, it appears to be a standard pattern matching library without evident malicious behavior. The code does not contain any network access, data leaks, or system modifications. It primarily provides pattern matching capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard extension of pattern matching functions with no indications of malicious intent. It relies on an external module _wcparse, which is assumed to be a trusted library. No suspicious behaviors or security issues are detected based on this code snippet.",
