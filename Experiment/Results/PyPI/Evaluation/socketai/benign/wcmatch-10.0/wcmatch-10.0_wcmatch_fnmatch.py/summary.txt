  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward wrapper around `_wcparse`, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The primary security consideration is the trust in `_wcparse`. Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2), mainly due to reliance on an external module. No modifications to scores are necessary based on this review."
