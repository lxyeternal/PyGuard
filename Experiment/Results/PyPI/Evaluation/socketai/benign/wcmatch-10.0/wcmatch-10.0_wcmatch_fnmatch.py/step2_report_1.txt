  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core concerns: potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code wraps an internal module `_wcparse` to provide pattern matching functions. No malicious code or obfuscation detected; concerns hinge on `_wcparse`'s trustworthiness.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior identified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, based on external dependency trust.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code itself is benign, but external module trust is critical.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the wrapper delegates core logic to `_wcparse`. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a wrapper around `_wcparse` with no signs of malicious behavior. No obfuscation or secrets.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern: wrapper functions delegating to `_wcparse`. No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code is a straightforward wrapper.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature. The core logic relies on an external module `_wcparse`, whose trustworthiness is critical. Since the code is a simple wrapper, there's no indication of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation, but all are low, reflecting the minimal inherent risk in this wrapper code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The primary security concern remains the trustworthiness of `_wcparse`. If `_wcparse` is malicious or compromised, it could introduce risks, but this is outside the scope of the current code snippet.\n- No changes needed to the scores based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, mainly depending on external module trust.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign wrapper around an external pattern matching library, with no evident security issues within this snippet.",
