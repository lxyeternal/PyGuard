{
  "purpose": "Implement custom wildcard pattern matching functions similar to fnmatch, including translation, filtering, escaping, and pattern analysis.",
  "sources": "Import from __future__, local module _wcparse, standard typing module, internal functions, and constants. Reads pattern inputs, filename inputs, flags, and exclusion patterns.",
  "sinks": "Calls to functions in _wcparse such as compile, match, escape, is_magic, and translate, which are assumed to be implemented elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Patterns and filenames flow into functions like fnmatch, filter, escape, is_magic, which invoke internal _wcparse methods. Data is processed through pattern compilation and matching functions.",
  "anomalies": "Code uses dynamic function calls and pattern translation without explicit validation or sanitization. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors observed. No suspicious network or system operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a wrapper around an internal module _wcparse for pattern matching operations. It includes functions to translate patterns, check matches, filter filenames, escape patterns, and determine pattern complexity. The functions primarily rely on _wcparse for core operations. No user input is directly executed as code; pattern inputs are only processed and matched. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or system manipulation code detected. The module appears to be a standard implementation of pattern matching functionalities with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around an external pattern matching module, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It does not include malicious behaviors, data leaks, or backdoors. The overall security risk is minimal.",
