  "purpose": "Extension of pathlib with custom globbing, pattern matching, and filesystem path handling, supporting platform-specific behaviors and internal flag management.",
  "sources": "Pattern inputs, environment variables (os.name), filesystem attributes (is_dir()), internal glob modules, pattern flags, and path string conversions.",
  "sinks": "glob.globmatch, glob.iglob, filesystem methods like is_dir() and joinpath, internal glob functions, and pattern matching logic.",
  "flows": "Pattern inputs and flags flow into glob functions and path methods, influencing filesystem traversal and pattern matching outcomes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; use of proprietary internal flags and pattern handling is standard for such utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code extends pathlib classes with additional globbing and pattern matching capabilities, platform-aware path translation, and filesystem traversal methods. It delegates pattern matching to internal modules and manages internal flags for pattern behaviors. No malicious code, backdoors, or network activity are present. The code is well-structured, clear, and aligns with typical pattern matching extensions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured extension of pathlib for custom globbing and pattern matching, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.",
