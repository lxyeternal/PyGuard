  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step and compare them with the code.\n\n**1. Code Confirmation:**\n- The code dynamically loads a `__meta__.py` file from a specified path using `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location`.\n- It calls `_get_dev_status()` on `__version_info__` attribute within that module.\n- It updates package metadata classifiers with the retrieved development status and static classifiers.\n- No external inputs are used in a way that could lead to code injection, and no malicious code is evident.\n\n**2. Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code performs dynamic loading of a local file, which is standard for plugin systems.\n- No report mentions any hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- The main concern is the potential for malicious or tampered `__meta__.py` files, but this is inherent in any dynamic code execution from external files.\n\n**3. Scores and Justification:**\n- All reports assign `malware` score as 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- `securityRisk` scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal risk, primarily the reliance on the integrity of the loaded file.\n- Confidence scores are high (0.9), which is reasonable given the consistent analysis.\n\n**4. Risk and Malware Scores:**\n- The code does not perform any network activity, handle untrusted data beyond local files, or contain obfuscation.\n- The only real risk is if the `__meta__.py` file is malicious, but this is a known and accepted pattern in plugin architecture.\n- Therefore, a `malware` score of 0 is justified.\n- The `securityRisk` could be slightly higher if the `root` path is influenced externally, but given the context, it remains low.\n\n**5. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all acknowledge the dynamic import pattern and its standard use.\n- The potential for malicious behavior is only theoretical, not evidenced here.\n\n**6. Consistency of Scores:**\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- The scores reflect the actual analysis: safe, standard dynamic loading with minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected, no suspicious behavior)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal risk, mainly due to trust in the loaded file's integrity)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a typical pattern for dynamically loading metadata in build systems. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, nor does it contain obfuscation. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of the `__meta__.py` file, which is a standard caveat in such patterns.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (considering the reliance on external files, but standard practice)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' findings.",
