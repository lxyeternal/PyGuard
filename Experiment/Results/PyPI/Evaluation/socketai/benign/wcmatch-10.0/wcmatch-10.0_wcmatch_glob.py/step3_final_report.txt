  "purpose": "Implementation of a glob pattern matching utility supporting pattern expansion, directory traversal, and filtering.",
  "sources": "Filesystem access via os.scandir, os.lstat, pattern expansion functions, pattern compilation.",
  "sinks": "Pattern matching functions, filesystem traversal, directory listing.",
  "flows": "Pattern expansion → directory traversal → pattern matching → filtering of results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem pattern matching with pattern expansion, directory traversal, and filtering. It uses well-known modules and functions, with no signs of malicious payloads, code injection, or sabotage. The third-party modules used are typical for pattern parsing and expansion. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The logic is consistent, and the security implications are minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured glob pattern matching library with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. It performs expected filesystem operations and pattern matching, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
