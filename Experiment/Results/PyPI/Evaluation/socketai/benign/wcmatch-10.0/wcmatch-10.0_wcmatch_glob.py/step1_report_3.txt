  "purpose": "Implementation of a custom glob matching library to find files based on pattern matching, supporting features like wildcards, brace expansion, path normalization, and exclusion patterns.",
  "sources": "Reads input patterns, pattern expansions, filesystem directory listings via os.scandir, environment variables (indirectly through os and sys modules), and user-provided filename inputs for pattern matching.",
  "sinks": "Uses filesystem access functions (os.scandir, os.stat, os.lstat, os.open), path manipulations (os.path.join), and pattern matching functions (re.match, pattern.match). No explicit network or system command calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input patterns → pattern expansion and parsing → directory traversal and pattern matching → final matching against filenames for inclusion/exclusion.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be a standard, well-structured glob pattern implementation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscation or unnecessary dynamic code execution is evident. Use of standard modules like os, sys, re, functools, and custom modules with likely safe functions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs pattern parsing, directory traversal, pattern matching, and filtering operations with extensive support for pattern features. It handles pattern expansion, directory listing, and path normalization securely using standard library functions. No malicious data exfiltration, network communication, or system disruption mechanisms are evident. The code does not execute external commands, write to system files, or access sensitive environment variables. The pattern matching and filesystem interaction are confined to intended safe operations. No hardcoded secrets or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, comprehensive implementation of a glob pattern matching library. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. The security risk is minimal, with no evident vectors for malicious exploits.",
