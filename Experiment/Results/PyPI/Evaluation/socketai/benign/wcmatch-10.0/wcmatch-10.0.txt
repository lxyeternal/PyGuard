      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation for dynamically loading package metadata. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of the '__meta__.py' file and the 'root' path, which is outside the code's control. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

The risk score (~0.2) reflects the inherent regex DoS risk, which is mitigated by pattern limits. Obfuscation is minimal, and overall security risk is low and consistent with the analysis."

Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2), mainly due to reliance on an external module. No modifications to scores are necessary based on this review."
