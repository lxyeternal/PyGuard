  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured pattern matching utility for filesystem paths, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The low malware score (0) is justified. The risk score (~0.2) reflects the inherent regex DoS risk, which is mitigated by pattern limits. Obfuscation is minimal, and overall security risk is low and consistent with the analysis."
