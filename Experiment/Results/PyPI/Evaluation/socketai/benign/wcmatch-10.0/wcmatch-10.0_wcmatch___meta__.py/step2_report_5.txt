  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is a version parsing utility with no malicious behavior, no external data, and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The code strictly performs version parsing, validation, and formatting. No network activity, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 (minimal, as it's a utility with no evident security concern). The report's confidence is high.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing correctness and validation without external interactions.\n- **Assessment:** The code again performs validation and parsing with no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low). Confidence is high.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is consistent with the code. No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard semantic versioning utility, no external I/O or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely for version parsing and validation, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. All good.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on version validation with no external effects.\n- **Assessment:** No external data, no malicious code, just validation and formatting.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Confident.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a version utility with no malicious behavior, no external system interactions.\n- **Assessment:** The logic is straightforward, with validation and parsing only.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Confident.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is a well-structured version parsing and validation utility.\n- **Malware/malicious behavior:** None detected. The code does not perform network, file, or system modifications.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, primarily due to validation logic, which prevents malformed or implicit pre/post releases.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe, and well-documented version parsing utility with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain attack vectors. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No further modifications or higher risk scores are justified based on this review.",
