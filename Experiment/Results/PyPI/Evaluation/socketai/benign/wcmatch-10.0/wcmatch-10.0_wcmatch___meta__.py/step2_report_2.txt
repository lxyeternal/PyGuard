  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the context of supply chain security.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue Presence:** The report correctly states that the code is a version parsing utility, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Risk Justification:** The report's conclusion of no security risk is justified.\n- **Overall:** The report is accurate; the code is a straightforward version handling utility.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue Presence:** The code is again a version parser and validator with no external data or network operations.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, consistent with the benign assessment.\n- **Risk Justification:** The minimal security risk score (0.1) is reasonable given the lack of external interactions.\n- **Overall:** The report correctly identifies the code as a safe version utility.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue Presence:** Similar to previous reports, the code is a version utility.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Justification:** The low security risk score (0) is justified.\n- **Overall:** The assessment aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue Presence:** Again, a version parsing and validation utility.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No suspicious or malicious behavior observed.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Risk Justification:** The minimal risk score is justified.\n- **Overall:** The report is accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue Presence:** Same as above; purely version management code.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0.\n- **Risk Justification:** No security risks identified.\n- **Overall:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Scores:** The risk scores are very low or zero, aligning with the code's functionality.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, well-documented, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — minimal security risk; no external or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured version parsing utility with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
