{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility for parsing, validating, and formatting software version strings according to a simplified semantic versioning scheme (PEP 440).",
  "sources": "The code reads input version strings in the form of strings matching the RE_VER regex pattern.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or system effects; the code only processes and validates version strings internally.",
  "flows": "Input version string -> parse_version() function -> validation and extraction -> Version object -> _get_canonical() for formatted output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version string parsing using regex, constructs a Version namedtuple with validation logic to ensure correct version components, and provides methods for comparison and formatting. It does not perform any network activity, file I/O, or system modifications. The validation rules prevent implicit pre/post releases and disallow unsupported version features. The code is transparent, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected. Its purpose is purely to handle version strings reliably.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured version parsing utility with no malicious intent, external system interactions, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
