{
  "purpose": "Define and parse semantic versioning (PEP 440) for a Python project, including validation, comparison, and version string formatting.",
  "sources": "Regular expression pattern for version parsing, class constructor for version validation, parse_version function for converting version strings to Version objects.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process untrusted input directly or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "parse_version() extracts data from version strings, validates, and constructs Version objects; Version class methods generate version strings and statuses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors; code appears to be a standard semantic versioning utility implementation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a version handling utility based on PEP 440. It includes a regex for parsing version strings, a class for representing and validating versions, and functions for parsing and generating version strings. The code performs input validation, comparison operations, and formatting but does not include any external network communication, file manipulation, or other potentially malicious actions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. Its purpose is solely related to version management within a project.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of semantic version parsing and validation with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behaviors. It is a utility module for version handling, and its design and content are consistent with safe, non-malicious code.",
