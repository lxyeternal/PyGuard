{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse, validate, and manage version strings according to a custom semantic versioning scheme, primarily used for handling package release versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads version strings from input parameters in functions such as parse_version and from the module variable __version__.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any operations that could lead to data leaks, system compromise, or malicious actions. It mainly processes version strings without executing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Version strings are received from input parameters and regular expression matching, then parsed into Version objects. The Version objects are used internally to generate canonical version strings. There are no external data flows that lead to untrusted system actions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive comments, validation logic, and structured parsing, with no apparent obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or suspicious behavior detected. The only minor concern is the use of 'release' comparisons with strings, but they are used within validation context.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Version class with validation logic for semantic versioning, including pre-releases, post-releases, and development releases. It uses regex to parse version strings into structured components and enforces rules to prevent implicit pre-releases or post-releases, ensuring version integrity. The code is well-structured, with validation checks and string formatting to produce canonical version representations. There are no network calls, data leaks, or malicious code constructs. All operations are purely computational and related to version management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version parsing and validation utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is solely focused on handling version strings and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
