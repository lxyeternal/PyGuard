{
  "purpose": "This code defines a structured approach to parsing, validating, and representing software version numbers according to specific rules and conventions (similar to PEP 440).",
  "sources": "Input source is the version string passed to parse_version(). No external data sources or inputs are read elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or sensitive data handling. The code does not send data externally or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The flow involves parsing a version string via parse_version() to produce a Version object, which is then used to generate a canonical version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed. The code primarily handles string parsing, validation, and version representation without side effects or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a detailed and structured approach to managing versioning, with strict validation rules for pre-releases, development releases, post-releases, and final releases. It uses regular expressions for parsing, namedtuple for data structure, and includes validation to prevent implicit or invalid release versions. The logic is focused on correctness and clarity. No network operations, file I/O, or cryptographic functions are present. The code appears to be purely informational and version handling without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured version parsing and validation module with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not contain any network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The overall security risk is minimal.",
