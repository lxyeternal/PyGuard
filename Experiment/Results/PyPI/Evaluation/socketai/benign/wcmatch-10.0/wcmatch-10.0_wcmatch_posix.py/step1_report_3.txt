{
  "purpose": "Provides mappings and a function to retrieve POSIX character property categories based on input strings.",
  "sources": "The function get_posix_property reads the 'value' parameter provided at call time to determine which POSIX property to retrieve.",
  "sinks": "The retrieved property data is returned as a string; no direct untrusted data sink is evident. No external or untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'value' flows through the get_posix_property function and is used to access dictionaries, returning predefined string patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and static, with no dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two large dictionaries mapping POSIX character classes to string ranges, for Unicode and ASCII. The get_posix_property function retrieves these mappings based on a string key. The function handles errors by raising a ValueError if an invalid key is supplied. There are no external data inputs, network activity, or any operations that could be malicious. Usage is purely for lookups and data retrieval from static dictionaries, with no evidence of malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard lookup utility for POSIX character properties. It is benign, with no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks detected. It simply returns static string ranges based on predefined keys.",
