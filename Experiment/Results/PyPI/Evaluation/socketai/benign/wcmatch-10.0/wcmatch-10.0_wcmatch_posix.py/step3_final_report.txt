  "purpose": "Provides a static utility for retrieving POSIX character class property definitions based on input strings.",
  "sources": "The function get_posix_property reads the 'value' parameter to determine which property dictionary to access.",
  "sinks": "The function accesses static dictionaries; no untrusted data is written or transmitted outside the function.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is used to index into either ascii_posix_properties or unicode_posix_properties, with error handling for invalid keys.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward with static data and standard error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static dictionaries for POSIX character properties, both Unicode and ASCII, and a retrieval function that returns the corresponding string based on the input key. The function handles invalid keys by raising a ValueError. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or obfuscation patterns. The data is static and benign, intended for pattern matching or validation purposes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The exception handling is standard and appropriate. Overall, the code is a simple, static lookup utility with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static data utility for POSIX character class definitions, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with its behavior, and no further action is necessary.",
