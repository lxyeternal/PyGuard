{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for compatibility handling, pattern normalization, string iteration, immutability, hidden file detection, deprecation warnings, and platform checks.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, system platform info, file paths, and regex patterns during normalization and hidden file detection.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the code mainly processes and normalizes data internally. Warnings are issued for deprecations but do not execute unsafe actions.",
  "flows": "The code reads system info and pattern strings; processes regex matches for pattern normalization; checks file attributes; issues warnings for deprecated functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behavior observed. All functions perform benign utility operations. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. No network or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs platform detection, pattern normalization, string iteration, and file attribute checks. It defines utility functions and classes, such as immutable objects and deprecation warnings, with no suspicious logic or external data transmission. The regex patterns normalize escape sequences, and the functions handle system-specific behaviors securely. There is no evidence of code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The use of warnings for deprecated functions is standard practice and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module for compatibility and string handling. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a standard, well-structured utility code without suspicious features.",
