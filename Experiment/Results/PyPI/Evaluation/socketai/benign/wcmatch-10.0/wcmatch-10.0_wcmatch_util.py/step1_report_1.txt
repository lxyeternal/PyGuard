{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities, pattern normalization, string iteration, and system-related functions for handling platform-specific behaviors in Python.",
  "sources": "Uses system info (sys.platform, sys.version_info), environment variables (implicitly via sys), and input parameters such as patterns and paths.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; functions perform pattern normalization, file system checks, or warnings without data exfiltration or dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Input data from parameters (patterns, paths) processed through normalization, regex matching, or attribute checks. No untrusted data flows to potentially malicious sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded credentials; no backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behaviors observed. Use of system-specific checks and pattern normalization appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily utility functions for platform detection, pattern normalization, string processing, and deprecation warnings. It uses regex for string normalization, system calls for file attributes, and warnings for deprecation notices. No malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or dangerous operations are evident. The functions are safe, well-structured, and serve compatibility or informational purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of utility functions for platform detection, pattern normalization, string iteration, and deprecation warnings. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be standard, safe, and non-malicious code for internal or external library use.",
