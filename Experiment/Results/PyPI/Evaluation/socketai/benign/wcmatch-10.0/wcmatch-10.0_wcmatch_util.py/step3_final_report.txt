  "purpose": "Utility functions for platform detection, pattern normalization, string iteration, and deprecation warnings, primarily for compatibility purposes.",
  "sources": "System attributes (sys.platform, os.lstat), regex pattern matches, environment variables, function parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data into dangerous operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is utility and configuration, not data processing or execution flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, standard, and free of suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides compatibility utilities, regex pattern normalization, string iteration, and deprecation warnings. It uses standard modules and system attributes without any network, file modification, or code execution features. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The regex patterns are standard for pattern normalization. Platform detection relies on sys.platform, and functions like is_hidden use system-specific attributes correctly. The deprecation functions use warnings.warn appropriately. Overall, the code is benign, utility-focused, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured compatibility utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and very low risk score (~0.0 to 0.2) are appropriate. The code poses no threat and requires no mitigation.",
