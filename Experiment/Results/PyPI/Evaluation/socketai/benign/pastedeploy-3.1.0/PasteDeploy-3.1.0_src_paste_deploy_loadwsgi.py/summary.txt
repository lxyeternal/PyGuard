  "conclusion": "The code is a typical plugin and component loader framework that relies on dynamic code execution, which introduces inherent security risks if external configurations or packages are malicious or untrusted. No actual malware or malicious behavior is detected within the code. The risk is primarily due to the potential for exploitation through external inputs, not the code itself. Proper validation, code signing, and sandboxing are recommended to mitigate these risks. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a moderate to high risk score reflecting the inherent dangers of dynamic loading."
