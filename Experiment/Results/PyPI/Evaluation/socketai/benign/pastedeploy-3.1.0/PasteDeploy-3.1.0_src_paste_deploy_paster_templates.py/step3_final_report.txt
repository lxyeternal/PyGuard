{
  "purpose": "A deployment template for paste.deploy that modifies setup.py to include requirements and entry points, and optionally prints deployment instructions.",
  "sources": "Reads input variables for package info, modifies setup.py file, and prints to stdout if verbose.",
  "sinks": "Modifies setup.py with static strings based on input variables; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input variables are used to generate strings inserted into setup.py; no dynamic code execution or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; standard static string insertions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for modifying setup.py during package deployment, inserting requirements and entry points based on input variables. It also prints deployment instructions if verbose mode is enabled. No malicious activity, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The modifications are static and typical for setup scripts. The code's behavior is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard deployment template for Python packages. It performs static modifications to setup.py and outputs instructions, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
