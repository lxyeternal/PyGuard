  "purpose": "Template class for deploying a web application via paste.deploy, modifying setup.py with requirements and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.path.join), input parameters (vars, command), and printing to console.",
  "sinks": "Writing to setup.py (potential modification of build scripts), printing output.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and environment variables influence file modifications and console output; no external data flows evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. The code modifies setup.py for packaging but does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a Template subclass for paste.deploy deployment. It modifies setup.py to include dependencies and entry points based on provided variables, and prints usage instructions if verbose. No external data sources are accessed beyond environment variables. No code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity is present. The code's purpose aligns with standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate template for packaging and deploying web applications using paste.deploy. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
