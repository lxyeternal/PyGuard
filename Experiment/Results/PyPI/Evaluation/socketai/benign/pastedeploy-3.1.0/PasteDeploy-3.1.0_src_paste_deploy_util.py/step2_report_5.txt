  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports identify the core functionality: utility functions for error handling, dynamic function invocation, and object/module lookup.\n- The primary security concern is the use of dynamic import and attribute access (`lookup_object`), which could be exploited if given untrusted input.\n- No report indicates actual malicious code, obfuscation, or signs of malware.\n- The scores assigned are mostly low, reflecting minimal inherent risk, with some variance.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Issue Presence:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct, and the functions perform as described. No issues or errors are present in the logic.\n- **Malware or obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are detected in the code snippets.\n- **Dynamic import risk:** The `lookup_object` function performs dynamic import and attribute access based on user-provided strings, which can be risky if inputs are untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n\n- The reports correctly identify the potential security risk in dynamic import and attribute access.\n- They appropriately note that the code is benign in its current form but could be exploited if misused with untrusted input.\n- No report claims the code is malicious or intentionally harmful, which aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Security Risk Score | Justification for Scores |\n|---------|----------------|----------------------|--------------------------|\n| 1       | 0              | 0.4                  | Slightly elevated risk due to dynamic import; no malware. |\n| 2       | 0              | 0.3                  | Similar reasoning; low risk, no malware. |\n| 3       | 0              | 0.2                  | Slightly lower risk; standard utility functions. |\n| 4       | 0              | 0.2                  | Same as above. |\n| 5       | 0              | 0.0                  | No apparent risk; purely utility functions. |\n\nAll scores seem reasonable given the context. The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate. The security risk scores are low, reflecting the potential misuse of dynamic import if inputs are untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Over- or Underestimation:\n\n- The **risk scores** are conservative and appropriate. Since the code does not execute arbitrary code directly, and no malicious intent is evident, higher scores are unwarranted.\n- The **malware scores** are correctly zero, as there's no malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly at 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** Given the potential for misuse via untrusted input, a score around 0.2–0.4 is justified. The highest among the reports (0.4) is reasonable, but perhaps slightly high given the benign nature of the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- The code is a standard utility module with no inherent malicious behavior.\n- The primary concern is the dynamic import via `lookup_object`, which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n| Metric            | Score |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| Malware           | 0      |\n| Obfuscated        | 0      |\n| Security Risk     | 0.2–0.3 (average ~0.25) |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with potential security implications only if used improperly with untrusted input. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are needed.",
