  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the potential misuse of dynamic import and attribute access if inputs are untrusted. Scores are appropriately low, with malware and obfuscation at 0, and a moderate security risk (~0.3) due to the dynamic nature. Proper input validation would mitigate misuse risks. Overall, the code is safe and standard, with no malicious intent detected."
