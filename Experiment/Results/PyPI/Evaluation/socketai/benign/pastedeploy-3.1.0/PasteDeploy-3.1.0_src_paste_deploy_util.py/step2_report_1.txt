  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** Utility functions for error handling and dynamic object lookup. The 'lookup_object' function performs dynamic imports and attribute access based on user-provided strings, which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.4 (moderate, due to potential misuse if inputs are untrusted)\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard utility code with no signs of malicious intent. The main concern is the dynamic import, which could be exploited if used with untrusted input.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing dynamic import via '__import__' and attribute access. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.3 (low, mainly about misuse potential)\n- **Assessment:** Legitimate utility functions; dynamic import is a security concern if misused, but no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Utility functions for error handling and dynamic module/object lookup. Potential misuse if malicious input is provided, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low)\n- **Assessment:** Standard utility code; the dynamic attribute and module access could be exploited but no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar utility functions with no signs of malicious intent. The dynamic import and getattr usage are standard but could be misused with untrusted input.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; primarily utility functions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Utility functions for error handling and dynamic lookup, with no external data sources or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Benign utility code, no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no signs of malware, malicious payloads, or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscated:** Clearly 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk Scores:** Generally low (0.2-0.4), reflecting potential misuse if inputs are untrusted but no active exploitation or malicious activity.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n\n- The core functionality involves dynamic import and attribute access, which are powerful but potentially dangerous if misused. However, the code itself does not contain malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscated payloads.\n- The malware score remains at 0 because there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The risk score, while low, is kept slightly above zero due to the potential for misuse if inputs are untrusted, which is a common concern with dynamic import mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Overall malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.2-0.4** (consistent with the reports; I suggest **0.3** as an average)\n\n**Note:** The code is a standard utility module. Its security risk hinges on how it's used—specifically, whether untrusted input is passed to 'lookup_object'. Proper input validation would mitigate potential misuse.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign and intended for debugging and dynamic object resolution. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The main security concern is misuse via untrusted input, but this does not elevate the code to malware status.",
