  "sources": "Input strings for 'lookup_object' which specify module and attribute paths.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import via __import__ and getattr, which can load arbitrary modules or attributes if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input string -> __import__ or getattr -> loaded module/object -> usage in code.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard use of introspection and dynamic import functions, no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for fixing type errors, calling callables with error correction, and dynamically importing objects based on string specifications. The 'lookup_object' function performs dynamic import and attribute access, which could be exploited if supplied with malicious or untrusted input, but the code itself contains no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors. The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and rely on standard Python introspection. The main security concern is misuse via untrusted input, not inherent malicious intent. Malware score is 0, as there are no malicious payloads. Obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward. The security risk score is moderate (around 0.3), reflecting potential misuse if inputs are not sanitized, but no active malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the potential misuse of dynamic import and attribute access if inputs are untrusted. Scores are appropriately low, with malware and obfuscation at 0, and a moderate security risk (~0.3) due to the dynamic nature. Proper input validation would mitigate misuse risks. Overall, the code is safe and standard, with no malicious intent detected.",
