  "purpose": "Manage namespace declaration and optional dependencies for package resource management and module finding.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pkg_resources, pkgutil, and modulefinder; usage of __path__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "Conditional import and fallback mechanisms, optional addition of package paths via modulefinder.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard fallback patterns; optional modulefinder usage for path extension.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard namespace declaration with 'pkg_resources', fallback extension with 'pkgutil', and optional modulefinder path addition. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leaks are evident. The use of fallback mechanisms and optional debugging tools is common in package setup routines. The security risk is minimal, and the code structure is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe namespace and path setup routine with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The initial high risk score in some reports (e.g., 0.9) is unwarranted; a more accurate risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern due to optional debugging features. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero.",
