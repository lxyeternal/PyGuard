  "purpose": "Import and load WSGI applications using Paste Deploy configuration",
  "sources": "Import statement from paste.deploy.loadwsgi",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external output",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can hide imported names and obscure code behavior; no other suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module with licensing comments and a single import statement. The 'import *' imports all names from 'paste.deploy.loadwsgi', which could potentially override existing identifiers or introduce hidden dependencies. There are no other code constructs, data processing, or external interactions present that could be malicious. The purpose appears to be to facilitate WSGI application loading, typical in Python web frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and standard for a Python web application setup. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The only concern is the use of 'import *', which can be considered poor practice but is not malicious.",
