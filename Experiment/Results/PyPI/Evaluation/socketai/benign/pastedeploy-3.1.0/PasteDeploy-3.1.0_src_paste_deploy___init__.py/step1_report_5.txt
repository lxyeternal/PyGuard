  "purpose": "Import modules from paste.deploy.loadwsgi, likely for WSGI application deployment.",
  "sources": "Import statement from paste.deploy.loadwsgi",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks observed; the code only imports a module",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; just an import statement",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import (*) which can obscure what is imported; no actual code execution or data handling shown",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from paste.deploy.loadwsgi, which is a module related to WSGI application deployment. The import is from an external package, and the only operation is a wildcard import. This pattern alone does not indicate malicious intent, but wildcard imports can sometimes hide unwanted or unexpected imported names. There are no input reads, data processing, or potentially dangerous operations present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior. It appears to be a standard import for WSGI deployment purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
