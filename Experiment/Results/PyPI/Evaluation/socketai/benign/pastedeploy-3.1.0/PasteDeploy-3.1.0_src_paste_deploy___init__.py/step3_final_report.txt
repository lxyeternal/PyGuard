  "purpose": "Import components from paste.deploy.loadwsgi for WSGI application deployment.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from paste.deploy.loadwsgi import *'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Import statement; no data flow or execution beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' is noted but is a common pattern; no malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal header with licensing comments and a single import statement from a known library. No code execution, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are evident. The use of 'import *' is discouraged but not malicious. The scores across reports correctly reflect the benign nature, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) due to style concerns. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, consisting solely of a standard import from a reputable open-source library. The use of 'import *' is a style concern but does not constitute a security risk. All assessments are accurate; no modifications are necessary.",
