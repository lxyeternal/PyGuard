  "purpose": "Static configuration script for Sphinx documentation, setting themes, extensions, project info, and output options.",
  "sources": "Standard modules (datetime, importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata), pylons_sphinx_themes",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network activity, or code execution",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static setup",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static configuration with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports only benign, standard modules and sets static configuration variables for documentation generation. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling. The purpose is purely configuration, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The version retrieval uses standard practices, and the theme setup is static. Overall, the code is safe, benign, and typical for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, static Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a benign setup suitable for documentation purposes.",
