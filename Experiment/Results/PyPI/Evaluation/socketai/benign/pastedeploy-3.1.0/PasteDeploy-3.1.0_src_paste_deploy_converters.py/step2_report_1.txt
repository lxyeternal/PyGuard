  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as utility functions for data normalization and type conversion.\n- They consistently note the absence of external data flows, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n- The functions perform straightforward conversions with proper validation and error handling.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious intent are identified.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is simple, standard, and well-understood.\n- The \"malware\" scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The \"obfuscated\" scores are 0, which is correct.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1, possibly due to the slight possibility of misinterpretation or over-caution, but given the code's simplicity, this is acceptable.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The only minor point is that the \"securityRisk\" score of 0.1 in report 3 might be slightly overcautious, but not unreasonable considering that the code could be part of a larger, more complex system. However, based solely on this code, the risk is negligible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk based on this code alone)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code is a standard utility module with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The current scoring reflects that accurately.",
