{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting objects to boolean, integer, or list types, likely used for data parsing and validation.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters (obj), which can be any Python object or string.",
  "sinks": "Conversions result in return values; no external sinks such as network, file, or environment access are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'obj' is processed through type checks and conversions; no external data flow or untrusted sink interactions are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code performs standard data conversions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward data type conversion utilities. 'asbool' interprets string representations of boolean values; 'asint' converts to integer with error handling; 'aslist' splits strings or returns list-like objects. All functions operate locally with no external data interactions. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions with no malicious intent or security issues. It safely converts input data types and does not interact with external systems or sensitive data.",
