{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for type conversion and input normalization, likely used for processing user or configuration data.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters: 'obj' in asbool, asint, and aslist functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no external sinks; functions return processed data or raise exceptions, with no data leaking or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input data is read in the functions, processed with straightforward conversions, and returned; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. Functions perform standard data validation and conversion.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple, standard utility functions for converting strings or other objects to boolean, integer, or list forms. No dynamic code execution, no external I/O, no obfuscated code, and no signs of malicious intent. Functions raise exceptions for invalid inputs, which is typical for input validation routines. No hidden or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of utility functions intended for data normalization and validation. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is likely part of a larger application or library for input handling.",
