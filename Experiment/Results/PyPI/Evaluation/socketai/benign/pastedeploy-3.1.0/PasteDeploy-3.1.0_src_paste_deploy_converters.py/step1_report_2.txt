  "purpose": "Utility functions for data type conversions (boolean, integer, list) with no external data interactions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: 'obj' in asbool, asint, and aslist.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data being written or sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input 'obj' flows through conversion functions with no external data output or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward data type conversion utilities. asbool interprets string values as booleans based on predefined sets. asint converts to integer with error handling. aslist splits strings into lists or returns the input as-is for list/tuple inputs. All functions contain standard logic without external dependencies or hidden behavior. No indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for data conversion with no malicious or security-related concerns identified.",
