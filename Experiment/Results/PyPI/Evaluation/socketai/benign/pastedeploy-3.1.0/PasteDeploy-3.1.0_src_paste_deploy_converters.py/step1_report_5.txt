  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting data types (boolean, integer, list) from various input formats.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: obj (for asbool, asint, aslist).",
  "fires": "Return values after conversions; no direct output or untrusted data handling beyond processing.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through conversion functions, which process and return standardized data types.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. Functions perform standard type conversions with proper error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides three utility functions: 'asbool' interprets string inputs as boolean, 'asint' converts input to integer, 'aslist' splits string or wraps objects into a list. All functions include input validation and error raising for invalid data. No external network activity, no use of environment variables, and no suspicious code patterns. No malware signatures, no obfuscated code, and no anomalous behavior present. The code is straightforward and intended for data normalization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for data type conversions. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
