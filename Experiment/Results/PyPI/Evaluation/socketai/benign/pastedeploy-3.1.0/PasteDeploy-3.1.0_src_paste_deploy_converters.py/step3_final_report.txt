  "purpose": "Utility functions for data normalization and type conversion, including asbool, asint, and aslist.",
  "sources": "Input strings or objects passed to the functions for conversion.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; functions return converted values or raise exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into conversion functions, which process and return normalized data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with standard validation and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple, well-defined utility functions for data type conversions. It performs no external I/O, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The functions validate input and raise exceptions on invalid data, which is typical for such routines. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code is clear, standard, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All assessments and scores indicating zero malware, zero obfuscation, and negligible security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
