{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting objects to boolean, integer, or list types, likely for configuration or input parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data can originate from string inputs passed to asbool, asint, or aslist functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions do not write or transmit data; they only process and return converted values.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the conversion functions and is processed locally without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious side-effects observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward data type conversions with standard validation. It employs simple checks against known true/false string sets for asbool, tries to parse integers for asint, and splits strings into lists for aslist. No external communication, file operations, or system modifications are present. The logic appears clean, standard, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs basic data conversions reliably and securely.",
