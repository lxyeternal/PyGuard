  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and immediately invokes it with default parameters. There are no arguments provided, indicating a basic package setup with no custom configurations. The code does not contain any input reading, data handling, or dynamic code execution. It appears as a typical minimal setup script. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code's simplicity and standard usage suggest no malicious intent or security risks.",
