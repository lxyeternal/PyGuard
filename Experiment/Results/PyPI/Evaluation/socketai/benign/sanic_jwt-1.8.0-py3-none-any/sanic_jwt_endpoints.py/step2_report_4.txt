  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes standard auth endpoint operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious code detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies no malicious behavior, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's straightforward implementation. No issues found. The low security risk score is appropriate given the absence of hardcoded secrets or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Properly describes typical auth flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Mentions use of `utils.call()` and cookie manipulation, but these are standard and not inherently malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No evidence of malicious activity; the code appears benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. External utility calls are common; unless their implementation is malicious (unknown here), no concern. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard auth endpoints, no suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-reasoned; code appears legitimate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly assesses the code as benign, with no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Typical auth API pattern.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious anomalies, no obfuscation, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Consistent with code; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard description.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3 — slightly higher but still low, considering the overall benign analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score, but still within reasonable bounds given the lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports are 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk scores:** Ranging from 0.2 to 0.3, reflecting low but not negligible risk; acceptable given the code's standard pattern.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** ~0.2 (low risk, standard auth code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. The code appears to be standard, secure, and free of malicious intent. No changes to scores are necessary.",
