  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is standard for authentication endpoints, with a high confidence score (0.9). The malware score is 0, which aligns with the conclusion.\n- **Score justification:** Given the code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, the malware score of 0 is reasonable. The obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (0.2).\n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed. The report's scores are consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it notes standard auth workflows, external utility calls, and no suspicious activity. The malware score is 0, and confidence is high.\n- **Score justification:** Since no malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident, malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard authentication endpoints with external utility functions. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. Malware score is 0.\n- **Score justification:** The code's logic does not suggest malicious intent, so malware remains 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar findings—standard auth flows, no obfuscation, no malicious activity, malware score 0.\n- **Score justification:** The code is straightforward; the malware score is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No adjustments needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—standard API endpoints, no suspicious code, malware score 0.\n- **Score justification:** Consistent with the code's apparent nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's straightforward, standard implementation.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the code's clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above 0.2 but still low, reflecting typical security considerations for such endpoints.\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Approximately 0.2–0.3, aligning with the reports.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and justified. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured authentication module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed. The scores accurately reflect the code's security posture.",
