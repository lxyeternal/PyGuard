  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the scores, and the potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard auth endpoints, data from requests and configs.\n- **Sinks:** Token generation, user data, responses.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious flows or anomalies. Uses typical patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code appears standard, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on external utility calls.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flow, response generation is standard.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `utils.call()` is noted but not suspicious by itself.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation, external utility functions are trusted.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No malware or obfuscation signs. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Authentication, token handling, user retrieval.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard token and user data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical auth API, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-reasoned. The code is standard, and the risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, standard auth endpoints.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Typical response and token handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard auth endpoints, request data, tokens.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Response generation, cookie handling, token validation.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score, but still justified given the overall analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and based on the code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious external calls.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, and the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0.2, with one at 0.3. Given the analysis, these are reasonable. The code is standard, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The scores reflect the code's nature well. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of authentication endpoints with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and a very low security risk.",
