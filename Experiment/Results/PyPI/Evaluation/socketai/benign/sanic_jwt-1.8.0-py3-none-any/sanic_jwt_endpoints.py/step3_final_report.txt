  "purpose": "Implementation of authentication and user retrieval endpoints for a web API, handling token issuance, validation, and user info retrieval.",
  "sources": "Request data, external utility functions (`utils.call`, `self.instance.ctx.auth.*` methods), configuration objects, payload extraction, cookies.",
  "sinks": "Response objects, token generation, cookie manipulation, user data output, response responses.",
  "flows": "Input requests -> utility/auth methods -> token/user data processing -> response generation -> output response.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard patterns for authentication endpoints, utilizing external utility functions and external auth context methods. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code structure is clear, with typical data flows for token handling and user info retrieval. External calls are expected in such contexts and do not indicate malicious intent. The response handling and cookie management are standard. The security considerations are minimal, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of authentication endpoints with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The low risk score reflects the minimal inherent security risk of such code. Overall, the code appears secure and appropriate for production use.",
