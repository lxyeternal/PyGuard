  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of authentication endpoints with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The low risk score reflects the minimal inherent security risk of such code. Overall, the code appears secure and appropriate for production use."
