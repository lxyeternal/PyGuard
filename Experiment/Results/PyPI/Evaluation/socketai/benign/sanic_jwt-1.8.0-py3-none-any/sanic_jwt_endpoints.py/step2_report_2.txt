  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard auth endpoints; data from requests and auth methods.\n- **Sinks:** Tokens, user data, responses—nothing suspicious.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No anomalies; external utility calls are typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious behavior. It relies on external auth functions, but nothing indicates malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar auth flow; uses external utils.\n- **Sinks:** Response objects, cookies, external calls.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious anomalies; external utility calls are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; standard auth pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Auth endpoints; request, payload, cookies.\n- **Sinks:** Responses, tokens, cookies; external utility calls.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious anomalies; external methods are trusted.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard auth logic, no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Auth workflows; request data, external utils.\n- **Sinks:** Responses, tokens, cookies.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No anomalies; typical patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard auth endpoints.\n- **Sinks:** Responses, tokens, cookies.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.3 are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports are 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Ranging from 0.2 to 0.3, reflecting low security risk, which is appropriate given the standard nature of the code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n- The code appears to be standard, well-structured authentication API endpoints with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- No changes needed to the scores based on the reports.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3 (consistent with reports)\n\n**Summary:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified, and the malware scores should remain at 0.",
