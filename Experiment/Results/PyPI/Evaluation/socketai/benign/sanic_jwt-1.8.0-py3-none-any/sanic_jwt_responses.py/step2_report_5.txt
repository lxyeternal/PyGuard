  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, assess the reasoning, and ensure the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The report states no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risks. It confirms standard cookie handling and token management.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code appears secure and standard. The low security risk score seems reasonable, given the code's purpose and the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious indicators.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious behavior, standard token handling, and cookie management. No obfuscation or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. The code's logic is standard, and no vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, standard token response handling, cookie setting, token splitting, and JSON response. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The token splitting is typical for JWTs, and no suspicious behavior is detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on extension points and standard practices. No malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears secure and standard, with no red flags.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Standard token and cookie management, with an observation that token splitting is somewhat uncommon but not malicious. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code's behavior is typical for authentication flows.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 across all reports is reasonable, reflecting minimal security concern given the code's purpose and the lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final System Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of token response handling, with no evident security issues or malicious intent. The scores are justified and consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary; the reports' assessments are accurate and aligned with the code's security posture.",
