{
  "purpose": "The code manages HTTP responses related to authentication tokens, including setting cookies with token data, and provides extension points for additional authentication processes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include request objects, user objects, configuration objects, and tokens such as access and refresh tokens.",
  "sinks": "Response objects where token data is stored as cookies, and JSON responses sent back to clients.",
  "flows": "Tokens are generated or received, then possibly split, and set into cookies via _set_cookie function. The token data flows from token generation or input to cookie storage or JSON output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code uses token splitting and cookie management in standard ways; no obfuscated code or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles token generation, setting cookies securely with configurable options, and generating JSON responses. No untrusted data is directly used in dangerous operations, and the token handling appears standard. The _set_cookie function assigns cookie attributes based on configuration, and the token splitting is a common practice for JWTs. There are extension points for further customization. Overall, the code follows standard patterns for token management without apparent malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation for managing authentication responses and cookies. It does not contain malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It appears safe from supply chain security risks. No malicious code or malicious behavior indicators found.",
