  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to identify any inconsistencies, errors, or signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages configuration for a Sanic JWT system, with no signs of malicious behavior. The default secret is plaintext, which is a security concern but not malicious. External utils functions are critical points but assumed safe.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, justified by the plaintext secret.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard configuration management with no malicious signs. The default secret's plaintext nature is a security concern but not malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the default secret's insecurity and potential issues with secrets loaded via utils.load_file_or_str. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.3 — slightly higher due to the plaintext secret, justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly notes the security concern with default secret and file loading but finds no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on configuration handling, secrets loaded from files, and the default secret. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, notes the default secret, dynamic config, and cache usage. No malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.3 — justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes the default secret, configuration management, and no malicious behavior. Mentions the alias 'secret' to 'public_key' as potentially confusing but not malicious.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Observations:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a configuration handler with no malicious behavior.\n\n- The only security concern is the presence of a hardcoded plaintext secret (`\"This is a big secret. Shhhhh\"`), which should be replaced with environment variables or secure secrets in production.\n\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident.\n\n- The reliance on external utils functions (e.g., `load_file_or_str`, `generate_token`) is noted, but without their implementation, we cannot assess maliciousness. However, their use here appears standard.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the plaintext secret, a small but non-negligible security risk exists. However, since this is a configuration module and no malicious behavior is evident, a moderate risk score (around 0.2–0.3) is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malware signatures or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n\n- **Security Risk:** **0.2–0.3** — primarily due to the default plaintext secret; this should be addressed before production deployment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard configuration management module for a JWT authentication system, with no signs of malicious intent. The primary concern is replacing the default secret with a secure, environment-based secret in production.",
