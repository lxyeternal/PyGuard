  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages configuration for a Sanic JWT system, with no signs of malicious behavior. The default secret is plaintext, which is a security concern but not malicious. External utils functions are critical points but are assumed benign.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified, no malicious code detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to default secret exposure.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The default secret being plaintext is a security risk but not malware. The score aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the default secret and file loading via utils.load_file_or_str. No malicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate, no malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.3 — slightly higher, but still low, due to default secret.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The default secret and external file loading are security concerns but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard configuration handling with defaults, overrides, and secrets loaded from files. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, primarily due to default secret.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is appropriate; no malicious behavior identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with notes on dynamic configuration and caching. The main concern is the insecure default secret.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.3 — acceptable, given the default secret issue.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes configuration management with default secrets and dynamic loading. No signs of malicious code.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to default secret.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, correctly indicating no malicious code detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, consistent with clear code.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero, justified by the presence of a default plaintext secret, which is a security concern but not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content and analysis.\n\n- The primary security concern is the default plaintext secret (`\"This is a big secret. Shhhhh\"`). It should be replaced with a secure, environment-managed secret before deployment.\n\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or supply chain compromise is present in this code fragment.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — primarily due to the default secret, which could be exploited if not replaced.\n\nThis aligns with the detailed assessments above, confirming that the code is a standard configuration management module with no malicious intent.",
