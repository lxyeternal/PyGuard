  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as configuration management for Sanic JWT, with sources being app_config, utils.load_file_or_str, and utils.generate_token.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Appropriately notes configuration access, secrets loading, caching, and token generation.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights the plaintext default secret, reliance on utils, but finds no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no signs of malware or malicious intent; security risk is low.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code matches the description; no issues found.  \n- The default secret is insecure but not malicious.  \n- The malware score is correctly 0.  \n- The overall risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable given the default secret's insecurity but no malicious activity.\n\n**Score suggestion:**  \n- Keep as is: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes configuration handling, including secrets loaded via utils.load_file_or_str.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes the hardcoded secret ('DEFAULT_SECRET') and potential issues with secrets/keys handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just insecure defaults and potential file handling issues.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The default secret remains a concern but is not malicious.  \n- No signs of malware or obfuscation.  \n- The risk score of 0.3 reflects some security concern but no active threat.\n\n**Score suggestion:**  \n- Keep as is: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar configuration handling, with secrets loaded from files.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions the default secret, standard file loading, no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, defaults should be replaced.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Consistent with the code; no malware.  \n- Risk score 0.2 is appropriate.\n\n**Score suggestion:**  \n- Keep as is: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern; configuration with secrets, cache, dynamic loading.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights the hardcoded secret and cache usage.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent, just insecure defaults.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malware, no obfuscation.  \n- Risk score 0.3 seems appropriate.\n\n**Score suggestion:**  \n- Keep as is: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes configuration management, secrets, and caching.\n- **Anomalies:** Points out the insecure hardcoded secret.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, just insecure defaults.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No signs of malware or obfuscation.  \n- Risk score 0.2 is suitable.\n\n**Score suggestion:**  \n- Keep as is: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the code's nature; no malicious code or backdoors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0; the code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly vary from 0.2 to 0.3, reflecting the insecure default secret but no active threats.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** Given the presence of a hardcoded secret (\"This is a big secret. Shhhhh\") which could be exploited if not replaced, a risk score of around **0.2** seems appropriate. Some reports suggest 0.3, which is acceptable but slightly conservative.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.2** — due to insecure default secret, but no active malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is standard configuration management for a JWT system. The main security concern is the default plaintext secret, which should be replaced in production environments. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent in this code snippet.",
