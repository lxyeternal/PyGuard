{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module initialization script that sets up imports, metadata, and logging configuration for a Python package related to authentication and API endpoints.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __credits__), import statements, logging configuration, and __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink points include import statements that could load malicious modules, logging configuration, or any dynamic code execution (none present).",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are visible. The module mainly defines metadata and imports internal components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code. The code is standard package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata, imports several internal modules, and configures logging. All imported modules are relative and likely part of the package. There are no external input sources, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. The __all__ list exposes package components, typical for Python modules. Overall, this appears to be a standard and benign package initialization script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no hardcoded credentials, no external data handling, and no malicious code patterns.",
