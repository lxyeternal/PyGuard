  "purpose": "Package initialization and metadata definition for a Python module.",
  "sources": "Static code defining version, author, credits, and importing internal modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static imports and metadata setup only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py file for a Python package, setting metadata, importing internal modules, and configuring logging with NullHandler. It contains no dynamic behavior, external data handling, network calls, or suspicious constructs. The code is static, clear, and typical for package setup, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its static and safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
