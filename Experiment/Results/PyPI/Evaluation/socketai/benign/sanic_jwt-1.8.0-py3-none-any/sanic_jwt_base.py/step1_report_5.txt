  "purpose": "Define a base class for derivatives with configuration and instance attributes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'config' and 'instance' passed to the constructor.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data processing or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters 'config' and 'instance' into object attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class constructor initializing two attributes from parameters. There are no external data reads, no untrusted data flows, no suspicious operations, or malicious patterns. The code appears to be a standard implementation of a base class. No indicators of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple class initializer with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It sets attributes from provided parameters, which by itself does not pose any security concerns.",
