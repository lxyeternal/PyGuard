  "purpose": "Define a base class for derivatives with configuration and instance attributes.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow occurs within this small code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The class defines an initializer that assigns provided 'config' and 'instance' parameters to object attributes. There are no external data reads, no processing of untrusted input, and no suspicious behaviors like network access, file operations, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be a typical base class setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, serving as a foundational class for inheritance. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
