  "purpose": "Define a base class for derivatives with initialization of configuration and instance objects.",
  "sources": "The constructor (__init__) method takes 'config' and 'instance' as parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from parameters 'config' and 'instance' to object attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and lacks suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class with an initializer that stores provided arguments into object attributes. There are no external calls, data handling beyond assignment, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no apparent malicious intent. The structure is minimal and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs simple attribute assignments without any suspicious or malicious operations.",
