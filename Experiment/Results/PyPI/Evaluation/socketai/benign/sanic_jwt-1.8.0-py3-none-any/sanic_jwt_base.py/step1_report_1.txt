  "purpose": "Define a base class for derivatives with initialization of configuration and instance.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'config' and 'instance' in the __init__ method.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters 'config' and 'instance' into object attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The class simply initializes two attributes from constructor parameters. No external data reads, no suspicious functions or code flows. No use of dynamic execution, no network activity, and no data leaks or backdoors. The code is minimal and clean, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic class definition with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be part of a larger framework or application structure. No security concerns are evident based on this fragment.",
