{
  "purpose": "This code defines a simple class with attribute initialization, serving as a base or data container in larger systems.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters 'config' and 'instance' assigned to instance attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no external data reads, no network operations, no file I/O, no environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into attribute assignments without further processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class constructor that assigns input parameters to object attributes. It does not perform any data validation, external data access, network communication, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. All signals indicate benign, standard behavior typical of base classes or data holders. No vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports accurately assess the code as non-malicious with appropriate scoring. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
