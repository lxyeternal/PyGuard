  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple class definition with an initializer that assigns provided parameters to instance variables. There are no external data reads, no malicious code, and no suspicious behavior. The class appears to be part of a larger codebase, but within this snippet, there is nothing indicative of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign and purely structural, defining a base class with no malicious or suspicious features.",
