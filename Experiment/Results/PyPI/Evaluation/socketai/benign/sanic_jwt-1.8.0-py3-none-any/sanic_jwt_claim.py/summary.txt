  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for custom JWT claim validation with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The main concern is potential runtime errors if attributes are not properly set, but this does not pose a security risk. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk are appropriate."
