  "purpose": "Define a custom claim class for JWT validation within the Sanic framework.",
  "sources": "Class initialization (__init__), get_key(), and _verify() method accessing payload and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Payload.get() used in _verify() potentially accessing untrusted data; adding instances to a claims set.",
  "flows": "Payload data retrieved in _verify() flows to validation logic, with class attribute usage for claim key.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity. The class relies on attributes that should be defined in subclasses, but this isn't inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for custom JWT claims, with methods to register claims and verify payload data. It raises exceptions if required attributes are missing or if verification fails. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The pattern appears standard for a plugin-based claim validation system. The code assumes subclassing or attribute assignment for 'key', 'setup', and 'verify', but this is typical and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a custom claim class for JWT validation, with no malicious behavior detected. It does not exhibit malware characteristics or security risks beyond normal application logic.",
