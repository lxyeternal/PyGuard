  "purpose": "Provides authentication, authorization, scope validation, and user injection decorators for Sanic web applications, ensuring route protection and user context management.",
  "sources": "Request data, decorator parameters, configuration functions, external auth methods (extract_payload, retrieve_user, validate_scopes).",
  "sinks": "Response objects, redirects, exceptions, auth checks, scope validation, user injection.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from request and decorator args into auth checks, scope validation, user extraction, and response generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Code structure is standard and transparent.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard security middleware patterns for Sanic, including async auth checks, scope validation, and user injection. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. Error handling is appropriate, and external calls appear legitimate. The code is well-structured, follows best practices, and does not contain any anomalies or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard security middleware component for Sanic applications. It performs expected functions without malicious intent or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.2), consistent with typical middleware. No issues or suspicious activity are detected.",
