{
  "purpose": "This module provides decorators and context managers for authentication, authorization, and user injection in a Sanic web application.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from request objects, function arguments, and configuration via instance.ctx.auth methods.",
  "sinks": "Response functions, redirects, and return values, especially within decorated functions, where untrusted data could influence responses or redirects.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from request payloads and context into authentication checks and scope validation; authenticated user info is injected into handlers; response generation is based on authentication results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are detected. The code uses deep copies and context managers appropriately. No obfuscated code, malicious network calls, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. All external function calls appear to be part of expected libraries or app logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard authentication and authorization decorators for a Sanic application. It uses context managers to temporarily cache configuration, performs auth checks via instance.ctx.auth methods, and handles responses or redirects accordingly. It validates scopes and injects user info into handlers. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code's complexity and structure align with typical security middleware patterns, with no suspicious data flows or hardcoded secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured, typical security middleware module for a Sanic app. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware signatures. All observed behaviors are consistent with legitimate authentication and authorization functions.",
