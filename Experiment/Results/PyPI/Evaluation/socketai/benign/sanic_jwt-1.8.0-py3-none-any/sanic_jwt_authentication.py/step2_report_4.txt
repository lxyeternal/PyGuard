  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, assessing the presence of issues, reasoning accuracy, and score appropriateness.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurately describes the code as a standard JWT authentication implementation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected. Proper handling of tokens, claims, secrets, and errors.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 — justified, no malicious activity.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n  - **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, standard practices.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Well-reasoned, consistent with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed. The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The security risk score is very low, reflecting the code's standard nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard JWT practices, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and proper handling.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 — justified.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — justified.\n  - **Security Risk:** 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Correct and consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed. The scores align well with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, describes a typical JWT auth system with no signs of malicious activity. Proper token extraction, validation, and secret management.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 — justified.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — justified.\n  - **Security Risk:** 0.2 — still low, given the code's standard practices.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same pattern—standard JWT handling, no malicious or suspicious code. Proper error handling, token management, and claim processing.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 — justified.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — justified.\n  - **Security Risk:** 0.2 — consistent with a typical JWT implementation.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Also describes a standard JWT system with no evident malicious behavior. The external utility functions are a potential concern, but based on the code snippet, no malicious actions are apparent.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 — justified.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — justified.\n  - **Security Risk:** 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No modifications necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly varied (0.1–0.2), but all justified given the standard JWT practices and external utility calls.\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent and well-structured.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, standard JWT implementation with proper error handling.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and their scores are reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.",
