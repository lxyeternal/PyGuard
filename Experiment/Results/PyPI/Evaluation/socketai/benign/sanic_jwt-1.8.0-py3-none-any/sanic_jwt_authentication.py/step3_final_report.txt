{
  "purpose": "This code implements a JWT authentication system, handling token creation, verification, and extraction from requests, with support for custom claims and secret management.",
  "sources": "Request headers, cookies, query parameters, and payloads for token extraction; external utility functions for claims and secrets.",
  "sinks": "jwt.decode and jwt.encode functions for token processing; potential data leaks if secrets or claims are mishandled, but no malicious sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Request input → token extraction → decoding/verification → payload processing → token generation or validation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; external utility calls are standard and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical JWT authentication module with proper error handling, claim management, and secret retrieval. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there are no malicious actions such as data exfiltration or network attacks. The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the clear and straightforward code. The security risk score is low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting standard JWT handling practices without evident vulnerabilities. The code aligns with best practices and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure JWT authentication implementation with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
