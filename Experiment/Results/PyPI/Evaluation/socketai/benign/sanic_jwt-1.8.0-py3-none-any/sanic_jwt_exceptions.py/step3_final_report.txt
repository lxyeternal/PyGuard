{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for JWT error handling within a Sanic application, providing structured error responses and status codes.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions with static or parameterized messages, inheritance from SanicException or SanicUnauthorized.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution present; exception messages are static or explicitly provided during instantiation.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation with message parameters, no external input or data flow leading to untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for JWT-related exceptions, inheriting from Sanic's exception classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Exception messages are static or explicitly set during instantiation, with no external data processing or network activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. No potential issues or malicious intent are evident. The code serves as a standard, maintainable error handling mechanism without any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception classes for JWT error handling in Sanic. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
