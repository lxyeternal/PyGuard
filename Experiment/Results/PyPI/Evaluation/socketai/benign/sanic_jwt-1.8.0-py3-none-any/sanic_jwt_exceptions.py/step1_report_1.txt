{
  "purpose": "This code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling various JWT and authentication-related errors within a Sanic web application framework.",
  "sources": "The code primarily reads class definitions, constructors, and constant strings. No external data input or untrusted sources are processed.",
  "sinks": "None observed. The code does not interact with external systems, perform network operations, or handle untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code is purely class and exception definitions with no data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. All strings are descriptive error messages; no code executes external commands, manipulates environment variables, or performs I/O operations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions to standardize error handling within a Sanic JWT context. No input handling, data processing, or external communication occurs. The exception classes only encapsulate error messages and status codes, with no dynamic or malicious code. The structure and content are consistent with typical application-level error management.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks in this code. It is a straightforward implementation of exception classes for error handling purposes. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
