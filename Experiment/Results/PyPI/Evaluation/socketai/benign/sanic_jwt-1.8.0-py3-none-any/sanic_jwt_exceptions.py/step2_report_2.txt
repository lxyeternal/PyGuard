  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for JWT-related errors within a Sanic web framework.\n   - All classes inherit from SanicException or SanicUnauthorized.\n   - Exception messages are static or passed via constructor parameters.\n   - No external data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution occurs.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code is purely structural, meant for error handling.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Vulnerabilities**:\n   - The code does not process untrusted input, perform I/O, or execute commands.\n   - Exception messages are standard and do not leak sensitive data.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or sabotage.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0 or very low (e.g., 0.5). Given the code's nature, a risk score of 0 is justified. No security risk is evident.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Misjudgments**:\n   - No issues are present in the code.\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessments.\n   - No need to increase any scores based on the evidence.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - The code could be part of a supply chain if the package it resides in is compromised, but based solely on this code snippet, there's no indication of malicious intent.\n   - Exception classes are standard practice and do not pose security risks.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for JWT error handling in a Sanic application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Recommendation**:\nNo changes needed; the current scores and assessments are appropriate.",
