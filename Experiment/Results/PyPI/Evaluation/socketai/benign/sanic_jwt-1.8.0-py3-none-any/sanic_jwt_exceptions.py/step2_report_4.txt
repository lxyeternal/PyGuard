  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is purely class definitions for custom exceptions related to JWT handling in Sanic.\n   - No external data processing, network calls, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n   - The code is static, with exception classes and message strings only.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is standard exception class definitions.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the analysis.\n   - The reports correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - These scores are reasonable given the static, exception-defining nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any risky operations or contain malicious payloads.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n   - No malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on static analysis.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as standard exception classes without hidden behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for JWT error handling.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, standard class definitions)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security threat. The reports correctly identify this, and no adjustments are necessary.",
