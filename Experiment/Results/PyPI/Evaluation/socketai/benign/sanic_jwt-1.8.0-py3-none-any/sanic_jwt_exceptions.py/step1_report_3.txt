{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various JWT-related errors in a Sanic web application.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; all classes are static definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; exception classes do not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; just class inheritance and initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard exception class definitions with no unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Sanic and SanicJWT base exceptions, intended for handling specific JWT error cases. All classes are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or data leaks. No input reading, external data, or network activity is present. The code appears to be a standard implementation of exception handling without malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of custom exception classes for JWT error handling in a Sanic application, with no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks. It is standard, well-structured, and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.",
