  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All five reports agree that the code is solely a set of exception class definitions for JWT error handling within a Sanic framework.\n- They note that there are no external data inputs, no network interactions, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, with static or parameterized messages, and no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or signs of supply chain sabotage are detected.\n- The confidence level across reports is high (1), and malware, obfuscation, and security risks are all rated as zero.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n\n- The code does **not** process untrusted data, perform external operations, or contain any code that could be malicious.\n- The purpose is purely to define custom exceptions for error handling.\n- The structure and messages are standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Potential issues or errors:**\n\n- No issues are identified in the code itself.\n- The exception classes are well-structured and follow typical patterns.\n\n**Scores and justifications:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior, code, or indicators.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — standard exception definitions pose no security risk.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\nBased on the detailed reviews, the code is benign, standard, and does not introduce any security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain component appears safe, well-structured, and standard for error handling in a JWT context within Sanic. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that the actual usage of these exceptions in the broader codebase does not introduce vulnerabilities, but based solely on this code snippet, there are no concerns.",
