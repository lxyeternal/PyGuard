{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors and invalid states within the Sanic JWT authentication framework.",
  "sources": "None, as the code only defines exception classes and imports, no data input or external sources are read.",
  "sinks": "None, no untrusted data handling or output is performed by this code.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code is solely class definitions without execution flow involving data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code strictly defines exception classes without any unusual logic, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises multiple custom exception classes inheriting from SanicException and SanicUnauthorized, intended for error handling in a JWT context within Sanic. All classes initialize with standard messages and status codes. There are no dynamic data manipulations, external inputs, or code execution. The structure is straightforward and adheres to standard exception class definitions. No suspicious or malicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, or potential supply chain threats are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code purely defines exception classes for a Sanic JWT library. It contains no malicious code, no external data handling, and does not exhibit any security risks. It appears to be a safe, standard implementation of custom exceptions with no signs of malicious intent.",
