  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is solely defining exception classes for JWT error handling within a Sanic application.\n   - No external data processing, network operations, or untrusted input handling is present.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural, with no runtime or malicious activity.\n   - No logical flaws or security issues are apparent in the exception class definitions.\n   - The reasoning that these are standard exception classes with no malicious intent is sound.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), reflecting the thorough analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code contains only exception class definitions with static messages and no external interactions, a risk score above 0.5 is unjustified.\n   - The malware score should remain at 0 because there's no malicious code or behavior.\n   - The obfuscated score should be 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score should be 0, as there's no vulnerability or malicious activity.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions about Vulnerabilities:**\n   - The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as non-malicious.\n   - No assumptions are made that could lead to false positives.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for JWT error handling in a Sanic application. It shows no signs of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate, and I concur with the assessments.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The supply chain risk for this code is negligible.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on the provided code and reports.",
