  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various JWT-related errors in a Sanic application.",
  "sources": "Import statements for exceptions, class definitions, super().__init__ calls with messages and kwargs",
  "sinks": "super().__init__ calls, potentially passing untrusted data as messages",
  "flows": "Exceptions initialized with messages that could originate from external sources",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; use of exception messages is standard",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes inheriting from Sanic exceptions, with messages that are static or passed as parameters during instantiation. There are no input sources, network interactions, or data processing. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors are present. The exception handling is typical for a JWT library, and the messages are either default strings or parameterized for clarity. Overall, the code appears purely structural, intended for error handling, with no malicious behavior or sabotage evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of custom exception classes for JWT error handling in a Sanic application. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. The structure is straightforward and aligns with standard practices for error management.",
