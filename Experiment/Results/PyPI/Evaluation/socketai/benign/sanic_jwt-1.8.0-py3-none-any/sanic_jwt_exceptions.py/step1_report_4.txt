{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling various JWT-related errors within a Sanic web application, providing specific error messages and status codes for different failure scenarios.",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily from constructor parameters for exception messages and optional arguments such as 'missing'. No external input sources or untrusted data inputs are directly read or processed in this code.",
  "sinks": "The code raises custom exceptions but does not perform any operations that send data over the network, access system resources, or manipulate data based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted inputs reaching sinks; exception messages are static or derived from safe parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, primarily defining exception classes with static or optional message strings. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions, with constructors setting message strings and status codes. No external input processing, data manipulation, or network operations are present. The exception classes are used for error handling within a larger JWT authentication framework. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of exception class definitions used for JWT error handling in a Sanic application. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leakage, and no suspicious or obfuscated code. It appears to be standard application code for error management.",
