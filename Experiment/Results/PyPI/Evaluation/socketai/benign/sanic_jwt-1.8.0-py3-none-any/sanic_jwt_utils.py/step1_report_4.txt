  "purpose": "Utility functions for token generation, claim building, file loading, and algorithm checking in a JWT-related context.",
  "sources": "os.urandom for random token generation, os.path.isfile for file existence checks, Path.read_text for file content, input parameters for claim building.",
  "sinks": "binascii.hexlify and os.urandom for randomness; file reading functions which could load sensitive data if misused; logging for debug messages.",
  "flows": "generate_token uses os.urandom as source; load_file_or_str reads files or strings; build_claim_* functions process attributes for claims; load_file_or_str outputs file contents; algorithm_is_asymmetric checks algorithm string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors; standard utility code with safe practices.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for token generation, claim construction, file reading, and algorithm validation. The generate_token function uses os.urandom for secure randomness, which is appropriate. load_file_or_str carefully reads from file paths or strings, with proper checks. No external inputs are directly used in sensitive operations outside expected parameters. The logging statements are for debugging purposes and do not pose a security risk. The algorithm_is_asymmetric function correctly interprets algorithm strings. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for JWT handling with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain attacks. It performs expected operations securely and responsibly.",
