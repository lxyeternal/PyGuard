  "purpose": "Utility functions for JWT token generation, claim building, file loading, and algorithm verification.",
  "sources": "os.urandom for token generation, file system for load_file_or_str, function arguments for claim building, input parameters for algorithm_is_asymmetric.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data leaks or malicious payloads; dynamic call() invocation is controlled within standard utility context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., os.urandom, file reads, function args) through utility functions; no suspicious or malicious flow patterns identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code; use of dynamic call() is standard but could be misused if misapplied, though not malicious here.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard cryptographic and file handling practices, with functions designed for JWT claim construction and secure token generation. The load_file_or_str function reads files securely with existence checks. The call() function handles async and sync functions properly. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The dynamic invocation via call() is a common pattern and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or sabotage elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for JWT and file handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to the flexible call() function but without malicious implications.",
