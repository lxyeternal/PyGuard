{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for token generation, claim building, async function calling, file loading, and algorithm checking, likely used in a JWT or similar token handling library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'path_or_str' for load_file_or_str, and optional arguments for token and claim functions.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly write to untrusted sinks; however, load_file_or_str reads files which could contain malicious data if used improperly.",
  "flows": "load_file_or_str reads from filesystem based on input; generate_token outputs random tokens; build_claim_* functions process data but do not perform external actions; call executes asynchronous or synchronous functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code uses standard libraries and functions without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions for token handling and file operations. generate_token uses os.urandom securely to generate random tokens, suitable for cryptographic purposes. build_claim_* functions create claims for tokens, with no external side effects. The 'call' function handles asynchronous and synchronous callables correctly. load_file_or_str reads files or strings safely; it uses Path and os.path.isfile checks, raising exceptions if files are not found. algorithm_is_asymmetric checks algorithms against known asymmetric types. All functions follow standard patterns without suspicious or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility module for token and file handling, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It adheres to standard practices without obfuscation or malicious logic.",
