  "purpose": "Utility functions for token generation, claim building, file loading, and algorithm verification in a security or authentication context.",
  "sources": "Input sources include file paths/contents (load_file_or_str), function parameters for claims and tokens, environment variables (via os.urandom), and callables (call).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are string outputs (generate_token, build_claim_*), file reading (load_file_or_str), and asynchronous function execution (call).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, such as os.urandom for token generation, datetime for claims, file reading in load_file_or_str, and callables execution in call.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials or hidden malicious code observed. Functions appear standard for token and claim handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions related to token generation, JWT claim construction, asynchronous call handling, file input management, and algorithm type verification. generate_token uses os.urandom to generate secure random tokens, which is standard. load_file_or_str reads files securely with proper existence checks, raising exceptions for missing files. The call function appropriately handles coroutines and callables. build_claim_* functions generate claims based on input attributes and current time, with no sensitive data or environment variables involved. algorithm_is_asymmetric correctly identifies asymmetric algorithms based on the input string. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No external network access or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of standard utility functions for token and claim handling within authentication workflows. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. The code is well-structured and secure in its current form.",
