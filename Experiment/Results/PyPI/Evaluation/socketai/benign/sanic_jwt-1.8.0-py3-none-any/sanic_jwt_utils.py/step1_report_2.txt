  "purpose": "Utility functions for token generation, claim building, asynchronous function calling, file loading, and algorithm verification in a security or authentication context.",
  "sources": "os.urandom for secure token generation, file system access via Path and os.path.isfile in load_file_or_str, function arguments for claims and algorithm verification.",
  "sinks": "os.urandom output, file read operations, potentially untrusted input in load_file_or_str, dynamic function invocation in call.",
  "flows": "generate_token uses os.urandom (source) -> returns token string; load_file_or_str reads file content or returns input string (source) -> returns data; call executes provided function (possibly untrusted) -> potential execution flow; build_claim_* functions return claim data based on parameters (source) -> used downstream.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code found. The code appears to perform standard cryptographic and file handling operations. The load_file_or_str function appropriately checks for file existence and raises exceptions, with no evident malicious behavior. The call function handles both coroutine and normal functions safely. The generate_token function uses os.urandom, a secure source of randomness. No obfuscated or misleading code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises utility functions typical for security tokens and claims management. generate_token securely generates a random token; build_claim_* functions create claim data based on inputs; load_file_or_str safely reads files or returns strings, with appropriate existence checks; call executes functions asynchronously or synchronously, handling both cases properly; algorithm_is_asymmetric checks if a given algorithm is asymmetric based on its name. There is no evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious control flow. All functions perform standard operations with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility code used in token-based authentication or JWT handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this module. The functions perform typical operations safely and appropriately. Overall, the code has a very low malicious intent likelihood.",
