  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for JWT, claims, file loading, algorithm checking.\n- Findings: No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious backdoors, standard use of os.urandom, safe file reads, no malicious code.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.1\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the functions are standard and safe. The low security risk score is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar utility functions for token, claims, async calls, file reads, algorithm verification.\n- Findings: No malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, proper handling of async/sync functions, secure token generation.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code's operations. The functions are typical for such utilities, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Findings: No malicious behavior, proper use of secure functions, safe file reads, correct async handling.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; the code appears benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for token and claim handling.\n- Findings: No hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, safe practices, no suspicious network activity.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for token, claims, file handling.\n- Findings: No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard libraries, safe practices.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports identify any actual issues or malicious code. All functions perform standard, well-understood operations.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, reflecting the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, primarily due to the potential misuse of dynamic function calls, but this is standard practice and not inherently malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a straightforward utility module for JWT handling and file operations, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or supply chain attack vectors. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware score at 0. as there's no malicious activity.  \n- Keep obfuscated at 0.  \n- Risk score can be slightly increased to around 0.1-0.2 if considering the potential for misuse of the dynamic call() function, but overall, it remains very low.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
