  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for JWT and file handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to the flexible call() function but without malicious implications."
