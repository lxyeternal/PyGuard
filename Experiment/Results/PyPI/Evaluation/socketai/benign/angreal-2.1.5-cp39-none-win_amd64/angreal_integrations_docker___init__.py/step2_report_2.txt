  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports focus on the same code snippet: a wildcard import from `angreal._integrations.docker`.\n- No actual code execution, data flow, or sensitive operations are present in the snippet.\n- The primary concern revolves around the use of `import *`, which can obscure what functions or classes are imported and potentially hide malicious or unintended code.\n- The reports do not provide evidence of malicious code within the import statement itself but suggest caution due to the module's nature and import pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  The code is a straightforward import statement; no functional issues are evident. The use of `import *` is discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n  The reports correctly identify the risks associated with wildcard imports and the potential for hidden or malicious code within the imported module. They do not overstate the threat, merely recommend caution.\n\n- **Scores assigned to issues:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the lack of evidence of malicious activity. Security risk scores vary from 0.1 to 0.3, reflecting low but cautious concern.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n#### 1. **Are the reported issues present?**  \n- **Yes.** The code itself is benign but the use of `import *` from a potentially sensitive module warrants caution.\n\n#### 2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n- The reports are consistent and cautious. They recognize that the import pattern could hide malicious code but do not claim it is malicious outright.\n\n#### 3. **Scores justification:**  \n- Malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports, given no evidence of malicious code.\n- Security risk scores are moderate (0.1 to 0.3), which seems reasonable considering the potential risks of wildcard imports from modules related to Docker, especially if the module source is untrusted.\n\n#### 4. **Potentially higher risk scores?**  \n- Since there's no evidence of malicious code, increasing the malware score isn't justified.\n- The security risk could be slightly higher if the module source is untrusted or if subsequent code uses the imported functions maliciously, but based solely on this snippet, the current scores are appropriate.\n\n#### 5. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly highlight the potential risks of the import pattern without asserting malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The module `angreal._integrations.docker` could contain sensitive or powerful functions related to Docker management.\n- The use of `import *` makes it difficult to audit what is imported, which can be a security concern if the module is compromised or untrusted.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are evident in the snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**; no evidence of malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential for misuse and the wildcard import pattern, a **moderate risk score of 0.3** is justified, aligning with the highest in the reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my expert judgment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                                                 |\n|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0.0               | No evidence of malicious activity in the code snippet.                      |\n| Obfuscated       | 0.0               | Code is straightforward; no obfuscation present.                            |\n| Security Risk    | 0.3               | Use of wildcard import from a potentially sensitive module warrants caution. |\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nFurther review of the `angreal._integrations.docker` module itself is advised to ensure it does not contain malicious code or vulnerabilities, especially if sourced from untrusted origins.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe code snippet itself is benign but should be used with caution in context, particularly regarding the import pattern and the trustworthiness of the imported module.",
