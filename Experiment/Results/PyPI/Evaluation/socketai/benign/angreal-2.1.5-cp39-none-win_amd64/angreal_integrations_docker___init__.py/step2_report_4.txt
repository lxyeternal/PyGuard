  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports are based on the same minimal code snippet: a single import statement.\n- The code only imports from `angreal._integrations.docker`, with some reports using `import *` and others using `from ... import *`.\n- No immediate malicious activity, data flow, or hardcoded secrets are visible.\n- The main concern revolves around the use of wildcard imports, which can obscure the imported functions and potentially hide malicious or unintended behavior.\n- The imported module's content and subsequent usage are unknown, making it difficult to definitively assess risk.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that the code is benign but cautions about the imported module's potential sensitivity.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. No malware or obfuscation, but the risk is slightly elevated due to the module's nature.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the benign nature of the import.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. Slightly lower risk score aligns with the minimal code.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.3\n- **Analysis:** Focuses on the wildcard import, which can obscure malicious functions.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly higher risk score is justified given the potential for hidden malicious code within the imported module, especially with wildcard import.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** Similar to previous, emphasizing that the import alone isn't malicious.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.3\n- **Analysis:** Highlights the risk of executing malicious code if the module is compromised.\n- **Verdict:** Justified, considering the use of wildcard import and potential for malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign `0`, as no malicious code is visible in the snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`, which is accurate given the simplicity.\n- **Risk scores:** Vary between 0.1 and 0.3, reflecting caution due to wildcard import and the potential for malicious code within the imported module.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **scores are reasonable** given the limited context.\n- The **higher risk scores (0.3)** are justified in reports emphasizing the risks of wildcard imports and potential hidden behaviors.\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0** unless further code shows malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code itself is benign; no signs of obfuscation or malware.\n- The main concern is **the import pattern** and **lack of visibility into the imported module's contents**.\n- The **risk scores** should stay at **0.1 to 0.3**, reflecting moderate caution.\n- The **malware score** should remain **0** unless additional context reveals malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (average of the provided scores, leaning towards cautious)\n\nThis conservative approach aligns with best practices in supply chain security—acknowledging potential risks without overestimating based solely on import statements.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** For comprehensive security, review the actual contents of `angreal._integrations.docker` and how it is used in the project. The import alone is not malicious but warrants cautious review.",
