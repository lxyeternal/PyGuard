  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the actual risk, validity of claims, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports analyze the same code snippet: a single import statement from `angreal._integrations.docker`.\n- The code is straightforward: `from angreal._integrations.docker import *` with linter suppression.\n- No active data flows, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no immediate malicious activity are evident.\n- The primary concern revolves around the use of wildcard imports and the potential for the imported module to contain malicious code or be misused later.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Importing all components from the module.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.7\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of evidence for malicious code.\n- The security risk is low but not zero, considering the potential for misuse of imported modules.\n- The confidence is moderate; the import itself is benign, but the module's contents could be risky if malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** The score seems reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Import all functions/classes, possibly for Docker operations.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Similar to Issue 1, very low risk, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- The slightly lower security risk score reflects the minimal concern.\n- Confidence is high, which is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Import everything, with emphasis on potential risks due to wildcard import.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.3\n- **Confidence:** 0.4\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The use of wildcard import is a concern because it obscures what is imported.\n- However, the code itself doesn't perform malicious actions.\n- The malware score remains 0, which is justified.\n- The security risk is slightly higher due to the import pattern, which is correctly reflected.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Import Docker functionalities; no direct activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Similar reasoning as previous reports.\n- The import is benign; the risk depends on subsequent usage.\n- Scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Import all components; potential risk if the module is malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.3\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The use of wildcard import warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified.\n- The security risk score is appropriately moderate, considering the import pattern.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, which aligns with the absence of evidence for malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Zero across all reports, correct given the straightforward import.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations, generally reflecting the concern over wildcard import and potential misuse.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The core issue is the use of `import *`, which is discouraged because it can hide malicious functions if the module is compromised.\n- The actual security risk hinges on the content of `angreal._integrations.docker`, which is not available here.\n- Since the import itself is benign, and no malicious activity is demonstrated, the malware score should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Final estimate:**\n\n| Score Type       | Suggested Value | Justification                                               |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No evidence of malicious code in the import statement.      |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Clear code with no obfuscation.                              |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2 – 0.3         | Slight concern due to wildcard import, but overall low risk.|\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe import statement itself is not malicious. The primary concern is the potential for misuse if the imported module contains malicious functions or if subsequent code misuses the imported components. Given the evidence, I recommend maintaining a malware score of 0, a low obfuscation score, and a modest security risk score (~0.2–0.3) to reflect the caution warranted by wildcard imports.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nReviewing the actual contents of `angreal._integrations.docker` is essential for a thorough security assessment. The import pattern alone does not indicate malicious activity but warrants cautious code review and adherence to best practices (avoiding wildcard imports).",
