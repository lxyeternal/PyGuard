  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the 'angreal._integrations.docker' module, possibly for Docker-related operations.",
  "sources": "The import statement imports code from 'angreal._integrations.docker'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are visible; potential for indirect use depends on imported functions.",
  "flows": "Imported functions or classes could be called later, but no specific flow is evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies like hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "This snippet is a simple import statement with a linter directive to ignore certain warnings. It imports an entire module related to Docker integration, which could be used for container management. No malicious code, data flows, or anomalies are visible in this limited context. The import itself is standard and does not indicate malicious intent, but the actual use of the imported module could pose risks if misused elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues in this fragment. The import's intent depends on subsequent code, which is not provided. There are no anomalies or malware indicators in this snippet.",
