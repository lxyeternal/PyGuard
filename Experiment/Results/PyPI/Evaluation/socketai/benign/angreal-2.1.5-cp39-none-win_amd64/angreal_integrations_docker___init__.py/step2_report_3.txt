  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code logic, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The report notes that the code is a straightforward import statement with no direct malicious activity, and the confidence is 0.7.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no signs of malware.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning is sound; the import itself is benign, but the module's content could be sensitive depending on usage. The score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the import is standard and benign, with a slightly higher confidence (0.8).\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with no malicious activity detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, as the code is just an import.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning is consistent. The import is benign, and the low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the use of a wildcard import, which can obscure imported components, and notes potential risks if misused.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malware, but the wildcard import warrants caution.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.3 — slightly higher due to the wildcard import, which can hide malicious functions.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Evaluation:** The caution about wildcard import is valid; however, without further context, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity. The risk score seems reasonable, but perhaps slightly conservative.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, noting the import's benign appearance but warning about the use of 'import *'.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — low, given the lack of suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning aligns with the code snippet; the import alone isn't malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the import is standard, with emphasis on the risks of wildcard import and potential hidden malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malware.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.3 — cautious due to wildcard import, but no actual malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Evaluation:** The caution is justified; the risk score seems appropriate given the potential for misuse.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code in these snippets.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Scores:** Generally low, reflecting the benign nature of import statements but noting the risks associated with wildcard imports.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- The use of `import *` is discouraged because it can hide imported functions, making security analysis harder. While it doesn't indicate malicious intent, it could be exploited if the imported module contains malicious functions.\n- The actual security risk depends heavily on how the imported module is used later. Since these snippets don't show usage, the risk remains low but warrants caution.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (consistent across all reports)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** Given the repeated warnings about wildcard imports and potential for misuse, I would suggest slightly increasing the risk score to **0.2** for these snippets, to reflect the potential hidden risks if the imported module is malicious or misused later.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimates:**\n\n| Score Type      | Value | Justification                                                  |\n|-----------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0       | No malicious code detected in snippets.                         |\n| Obfuscated      | 0       | Clear code, no obfuscation present.                              |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2     | Wildcard import can hide malicious functions; warrants caution. |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code snippets are benign import statements, but the use of wildcard imports warrants cautious review of the imported module's contents and subsequent usage. The current scores are appropriate, but a slight increase in the risk score to 0.2 could better reflect the potential hidden risks associated with wildcard imports.",
