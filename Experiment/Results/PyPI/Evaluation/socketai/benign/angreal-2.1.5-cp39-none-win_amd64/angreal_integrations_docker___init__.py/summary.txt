  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign in isolation, with no evidence of malicious code or obfuscation. The main concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious functions if present in the module. The current malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.2-0.3) is justified due to the import pattern. For thorough security assurance, review the contents of 'angreal._integrations.docker' and its usage in the project."
