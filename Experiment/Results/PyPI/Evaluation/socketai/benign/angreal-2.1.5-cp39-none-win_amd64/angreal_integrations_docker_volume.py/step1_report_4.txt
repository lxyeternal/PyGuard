  "purpose": "The code imports classes related to Docker volume management from a specific internal module within the angreal package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'angreal._integrations.docker.volume'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only an import statement without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement appears straightforward; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Volumes' and 'Volume' classes from an internal module related to Docker integration within the 'angreal' package. The line includes a 'noqa' comment to suppress linter warnings, likely for unused imports. There are no other code constructs, functions, or executable statements present. The import is standard and does not indicate malicious intent or security risks by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple import statement for Docker volume management classes from an internal module. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The 'noqa' comment suggests awareness of unused imports, which is common in code where these classes may be used elsewhere or in future code.",
