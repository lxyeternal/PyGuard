{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes 'Network' and 'Networks' from a module related to Docker network integrations within the 'angreal' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'angreal._integrations.docker.network' module to access specific classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data processing occurs within this snippet; it's purely import statements.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code constructs, or hidden behaviors. The comment '# ruff: noqa' suggests linting suppression, not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement, importing two classes from a specific module related to Docker networking. The presence of a 'noqa' comment indicates suppression of linter warnings but does not affect security. There are no input sources, no data flows, no suspicious or malicious code behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign import statement with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
