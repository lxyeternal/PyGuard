  "purpose": "Import classes Network and Networks from the Docker network integration module within the angreal package.",
  "sources": "The import statement from angreal._integrations.docker.network",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code only imports classes without executing or processing data",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static import only",
  "anomalies": "Presence of linter suppression comment '# ruff: noqa', but this is standard practice and not suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with a suppression comment. No data input, execution, or external data handling occurs. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The suppression comment could hide issues but is common and benign in this context. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concern due to the suppression comment but no actual threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of an import statement with a suppression comment. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores are appropriate and indicate a safe, standard import.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
