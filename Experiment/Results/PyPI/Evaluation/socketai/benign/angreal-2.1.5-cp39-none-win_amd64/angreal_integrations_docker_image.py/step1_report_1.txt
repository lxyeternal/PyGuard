{
  "purpose": "This code imports classes 'Images' and 'Image' from a module related to Docker integration within the 'angreal' package, likely for managing Docker images.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the module 'angreal._integrations.docker.image'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only performs a static import.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely imports classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a comment '# ruff: noqa', indicating suppression of linter warnings, which is common in certain contexts but not inherently suspicious. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement importing specific classes for Docker image management. The 'noqa' comment suggests intentional suppression of linter warnings. There is no evidence of input handling, untrusted data, or malicious behavior. The import points to an internal module of a known package. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement without any signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is likely part of a larger application that interacts with Docker images. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
