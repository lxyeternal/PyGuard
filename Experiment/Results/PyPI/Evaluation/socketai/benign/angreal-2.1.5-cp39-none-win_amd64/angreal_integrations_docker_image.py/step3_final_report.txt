{
  "purpose": "Import classes 'Images' and 'Image' from the internal 'angreal._integrations.docker.image' module, likely for Docker image management.",
  "sources": "Static import statement; no data input or external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static import without dynamic execution or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of '# ruff: noqa' comment to suppress linter warnings; common practice, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static import statement importing classes related to Docker images. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling occurs. The linter suppression comment is standard and not indicative of malicious intent. The import path suggests internal or third-party modules, which is typical for dependency management. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
