  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a simple import statement; no malicious code, data flow, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Confidence is 1, malware 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is benign; no reason to adjust scores.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; a straightforward import with a linter suppression.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior; the linter comment is standard.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Again, a minimal import statement.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.8, malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n- **Discussion:** The security risk score is slightly above zero, but since the code is just an import, this might be an overestimation. The 'securityRisk' could be lowered to 0 unless there's context suggesting otherwise.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same minimal import.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, security risk 0.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly indicate 0; the code is a simple import.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of any malicious or suspicious behavior, a risk score of 0 or very close to it is justified.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The presence of the `# ruff: noqa` comment is a linting override and not suspicious.\n- The import path appears to be from an internal or third-party library, but nothing indicates malicious intent.\n- No data flows, input handling, or code execution is involved here.\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if a conservative approach, but given the evidence, 0 is more appropriate)\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code snippet is benign and poses no security risk.",
