  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is a simple import statement from an internal module.\n- No anomalies, data flows, or suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1 (high certainty)\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the linter suppression comment.\n- No code execution or data handling.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still high.\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also similar, with mention of the suppression comment.\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), but given the code's nature, this seems overestimated.\n- Malware: 0\n- Confidence: 0.8\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as above, standard import with no suspicious activity.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous assessments.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Code presence:** The code snippet is just an import statement, which is benign.\n- **Malware or malicious behavior:** None of the reports or the code indicates malicious intent. The import is from an internal module, likely part of a larger Docker management system.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** Import statements alone do not introduce vulnerabilities unless the imported code is malicious or compromised. No evidence of this here.\n- **Scores consistency:** All scores align with the benign nature of the code. The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 at most, but likely 0, since the code is harmless.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious or security concerns. The linter suppression comment is common and not suspicious. No data flows, no external code execution, no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.\n\n**Overall recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering the suppression comment as a minor concern, but not a security risk)\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code snippet is benign and poses no security threat.",
