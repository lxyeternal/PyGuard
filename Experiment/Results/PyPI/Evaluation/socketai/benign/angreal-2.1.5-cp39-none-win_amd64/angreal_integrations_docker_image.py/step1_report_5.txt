{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import classes related to Docker images from the 'angreal' package, likely for managing or interacting with Docker images within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'angreal._integrations.docker.image' module to import 'Images' and 'Image' classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted data handling are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit source-to-sink data flows; the code only performs a static import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a comment '# ruff: noqa', which suppresses linter warnings; this is common and not inherently suspicious. The imported module path and class names are standard for a Docker management context. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is a minimal import statement with a linter suppression comment. It does not include any runtime logic, user input, network activity, or data handling. The import appears legitimate for managing Docker images, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement for Docker image management classes from the 'angreal' package. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks based on this fragment alone.",
