  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence is high (1), malware score is 0.\n- No issues identified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also confirms the import is straightforward with a linter suppression.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), malware score is 0.\n- No suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar analysis; the only anomaly is the '# ruff: noqa' comment.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.8), but still no malware.\n- Security risk is minimal (0.1), but that is acceptable given the context.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion: standard import with no malicious intent.\n- Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same reasoning; a simple import statement with no signs of malicious activity.\n- Confidence 1, malware 0.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports agree that the code is just an import statement with a linter suppression comment.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence or suspicion of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** Effectively zero; the code is static and not executing any untrusted data.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No, since the code does not handle input or perform any operations.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any malicious activity, the risk score should be 0 or very close to it.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The presence of `# ruff: noqa` is standard for suppressing linter warnings and does not indicate malicious intent.\n- The import path is from an internal module of a known package (`angreal`), which does not raise suspicion.\n- There are no signs of supply chain tampering or malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**Based on the provided reports and code snippet, the current scores are appropriate.** The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all be **0**.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is benign and typical in Python projects that manage Docker images.",
