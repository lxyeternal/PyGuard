      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The reports are generally appropriate given the missing code; however, risk scores of 0.2 should be reduced to 0 due to lack of evidence. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly at 0. No malicious activity or anomalies are detected. Confidence levels are reasonable, with adjustments needed only for overconfidence in some reports. Overall, the supply chain security assessment indicates minimal risk in the absence of code, and no further action is necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, minimal, and secure wrapper for git commands. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The low security risk score is justified, primarily considering potential misuse with untrusted inputs, which is typical for such utilities. The reports and scores are consistent with the code's behavior and structure."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The import statement is benign in isolation, with no evidence of malicious code or obfuscation. The main concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious functions if present in the module. The current malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.2-0.3) is justified due to the import pattern. For thorough security assurance, review the contents of 'angreal._integrations.docker' and its usage in the project."
