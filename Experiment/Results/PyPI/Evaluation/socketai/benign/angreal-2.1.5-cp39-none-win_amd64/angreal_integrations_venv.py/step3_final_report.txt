  "purpose": "Provides utilities for creating, activating, and managing Python virtual environments, including installing requirements via subprocess calls.",
  "sources": "Reading environment paths, requirements parameter, and environment variables; subprocess call to pip for installing requirements.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution of pip install with requirements input; modification of sys.prefix and sys.path during activation.",
  "flows": "Requirements input flows into subprocess call for pip install; environment paths flow into activation modifications; environment variables influence activation process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. Use of subprocess with external inputs could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but this is standard for such utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code manages virtual environments through creation, activation, and requirement installation. It uses standard modules and practices. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The subprocess call for pip install is a potential vector if inputs are malicious, but this is a known and accepted risk. Environment modifications are typical for activation. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential misuse scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for environment management with no inherent malicious intent. The main security concern is external input validation for requirements, not the code itself. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
