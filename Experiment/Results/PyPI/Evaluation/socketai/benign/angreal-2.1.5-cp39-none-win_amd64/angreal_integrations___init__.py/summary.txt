  "conclusion": "The reports are generally appropriate given the missing code; however, risk scores of 0.2 should be reduced to 0 due to lack of evidence. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly at 0. No malicious activity or anomalies are detected. Confidence levels are reasonable, with adjustments needed only for overconfidence in some reports. Overall, the supply chain security assessment indicates minimal risk in the absence of code, and no further action is necessary."
