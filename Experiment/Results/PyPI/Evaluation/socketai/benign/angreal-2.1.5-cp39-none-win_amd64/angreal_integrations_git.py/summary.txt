  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, minimal, and secure wrapper for git commands. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The low security risk score is justified, primarily considering potential misuse with untrusted inputs, which is typical for such utilities. The reports and scores are consistent with the code's behavior and structure."
