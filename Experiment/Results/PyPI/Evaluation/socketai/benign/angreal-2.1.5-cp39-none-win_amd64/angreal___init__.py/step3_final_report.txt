  "purpose": "Provides decorators and functions for registering CLI commands, arguments, and version validation within the 'angreal' framework.",
  "sources": "Imports 'angreal', accesses 'angreal' attributes like '__version__', decorators adding metadata to functions.",
  "sinks": "Raises EnvironmentError if version requirements are not met; calls 'angreal.main()' to execute CLI.",
  "flows": "Reads 'angreal' attributes for version info; decorators attach command and argument metadata; version check raises error if incompatible.",
  "anomalies": "Minor bug in 'required_version' where string formatting does not use an f-string, leading to a literal string instead of interpolated version.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of CLI command and argument registration using decorators, with a version check to ensure compatibility. It does not perform any network, file, or data exfiltration activities. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The only issue is a minor string formatting bug in 'required_version', which does not impact security but affects error message clarity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate CLI utility setup for 'angreal', with no malicious intent or security risks. The minor bug is non-security related. Overall, the code is safe, clear, and standard for such frameworks.",
