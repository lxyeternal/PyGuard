  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Explains the code's role in CLI command registration, version checking.\n- **Sources:** Imports, attribute access, decorators.\n- **Sinks:** No dangerous sinks; raises EnvironmentError on version mismatch.\n- **Flows:** Reads module attributes, decorators add metadata, version check raises error if needed.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns; standard usage.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; standard command registration code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate CLI setup code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing command registration, version validation, and safe practices.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with Report 1; no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar findings: decorators for command/argument registration, no external data or network activity, no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Clear that this is a benign CLI utility.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Focuses on the same core functionality—decorators, version checks, command registration.\n- Highlights that no suspicious activity is present.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same overall purpose.\n- Notes a potential minor bug in the string formatting within `required_version` (uses `\" {angreal.__version__}\"` instead of an f-string).\n- No malicious activity, network, or system access.\n- Slight concern about the string formatting bug, but it does not impact security.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The bug is minor and does not indicate malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard CLI command registration utility.\n- No evidence of malware, malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain attack vectors.\n- The only minor technical note is a possible string formatting bug in `required_version`, which is not security-related.\n- The code's operations are confined to decorators, attribute management, and version validation—nothing suspicious.\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\n| Metric             | Score (0 to 1) | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**       | **0**          | No malicious activity or payload detected.                 |\n| **Obfuscated**    | **0**          | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation patterns.  |\n| **Risk**          | **0.1**        | Very low; primarily version check and command registration. |\n\n**Note:** The risk score is kept very low because, although the code is benign, it interacts with a CLI framework that could, in theory, execute commands. However, as presented, it does not perform any dangerous actions.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThis code is a legitimate, standard implementation of CLI command and argument registration decorators for the 'angreal' framework. It poses no security threat or malware risk based on the provided content.",
