{
  "purpose": "The code defines decorators and utility functions for registering CLI commands and argument parsing, and handles version checking for the 'angreal' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`import angreal`, `from .angreal import *`) and attribute access (`angreal.__version__`, `angreal.__all__`), function parameters, and decorator functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous code execution or attribute manipulation occurs at the level of decorators and function wrapping, but no direct untrusted data sink appears. No network or file I/O is present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks are identified. The version check uses a hardcoded specifier, and decorator functions manipulate function attributes but do not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies heavily on dynamic attribute assignment and decorators but does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The 'required_version' function raises an EnvironmentError if version requirements are unmet, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up command and argument registration through decorators, manages command groups, and performs a version check. All operations are within standard Python practices. The import of 'angreal' and re-exporting its contents, as well as checking for '__all__', is typical for API wrappers. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, file access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of decorators and dynamic attribute assignment are common patterns and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or external inputs are processed in a suspicious manner. The version check raises an exception if the requirement is unmet, which is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard command registration and version checking utility for a CLI framework, with no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate command-line interface setup.",
