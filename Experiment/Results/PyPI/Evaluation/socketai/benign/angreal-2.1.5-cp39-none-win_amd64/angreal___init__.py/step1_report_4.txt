{
  "purpose": "This code defines decorators and functions for registering commands, arguments, and groups for a CLI framework called 'angreal'. It primarily manages command registration and version checks.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'angreal' module's version, its attributes (__all__), and user-defined functions decorated with command, group, or argument.",
  "sinks": "No clear sink points for untrusted data, no network, file system, or sensitive data access observed. The only potential sink could be 'angreal.main()' invocation, which might execute registered commands.",
  "flows": "User-defined functions are decorated with command, argument, and group decorators, which attach metadata to functions. The 'main()' function calls 'angreal.main()' to presumably execute the CLI logic.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The code relies on 'angreal' module functions and decorators, with no obfuscated or unusual language features. No backdoors or malicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up command-line interface decorators and version checking, with no evidence of malicious behavior. It imports 'angreal' and re-exports its attributes, which is standard for plugin-like frameworks. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious system modifications are present. The only notable aspect is the version check, which is a benign validation. Overall, the code appears to be a normal CLI command registration framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI decorator and registration setup for 'angreal', with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It appears safe based on the provided content.",
