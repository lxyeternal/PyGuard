{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators and utility functions for registering commands, arguments, and groups within the 'angreal' CLI framework, including version checking and main execution trigger.",
  "sources": "Reads 'angreal' module's __version__, __doc__, __all__, and attributes. Uses function decorators that access function attributes.",
  "sinks": "Raises EnvironmentError if version check fails. Creates 'angreal.Command' and 'angreal.Arg' objects. Calls 'angreal.main()' at the end.",
  "flows": "Code reads 'angreal' module attributes -> decorators assign attributes and create objects -> 'required_version' raises error if version mismatch -> 'main()' calls 'angreal.main()'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No network or system modifications observed. The code mainly sets up CLI command registration.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines decorators for command-line interface setup, including version validation, grouping, argument registration, and command registration. It interfaces with the 'angreal' module to instantiate command and argument objects, and calls 'angreal.main()' to execute. No network operations, data leaks, or suspicious code paths are present. The version check uses the 'packaging' library, and error handling is standard. No obfuscation or malware patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be legitimate CLI setup code for the 'angreal' framework, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily manages command registration and validation without performing harmful actions.",
