{
  "purpose": "This code defines decorators and utility functions for registering commands and arguments in the 'angreal' CLI framework, and performs version checking for the 'angreal' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'angreal' package's version (__version__), checks for __all__, and uses decorator arguments and function attributes to register command and argument metadata.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of 'angreal.Command', 'angreal.Group', and 'angreal.Arg', which may process user input or execute registered commands. The version check raises an EnvironmentError if conditions are unmet.",
  "flows": "The code flows from version validation to command and argument registration via decorators, storing metadata on functions, which could influence command execution in 'angreal'.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs no suspicious or malicious activities such as network operations, file modifications, or credential handling. There is a potential typo or bug in the version string interpolation within 'required_version' (using a raw string instead of an f-string). No obfuscated code or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides decorators for CLI command registration, version validation, and grouping. It uses standard Python features such as decorators, function attributes, and functools.partial. There are no signs of malicious activity or hidden payloads. The only minor concern is the string formatting in the 'required_version' function, which could result in incorrect error messages but does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI command registration utility for the 'angreal' framework with no malicious intent. It mainly manages metadata and version checking, with no network access, file manipulations, or other malicious activities. Slight concern about a possible string formatting bug but no security implications.",
