{
  "purpose": "Importing Container and Containers classes from the angreal._integrations.docker.container module, likely for managing Docker containers within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The import statement, which loads classes from a third-party or internal module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as system calls, network operations, or data writes are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data movement is observable in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a comment directive ('# ruff: noqa') that suppresses linter warnings; this is benign but indicates potential suppression of warnings. No other anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from a specific module related to Docker integration. The suppression comment suggests intentional suppression of linting issues, but no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. Since this is only an import statement, there are no active data flows or code execution to analyze. No evidence of malware, malicious intent, or security risks in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with a linter suppression comment, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, benign project involving Docker management.",
