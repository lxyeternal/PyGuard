  "purpose": "Importing Container and Containers classes from a module related to Docker integration in the angreal package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from angreal._integrations.docker.container",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or potentially harmful operations observed",
  "flows": "No data flow present; the code only performs an import",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement with a comment to ignore linter warnings. It imports two classes, Container and Containers, from a module associated with Docker container integration. There is no data processing, no user input, and no operations that could lead to security risks. The code appears to be part of a larger project setup or module import routine.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include any suspicious or malicious code; it simply imports classes for Docker container management.",
