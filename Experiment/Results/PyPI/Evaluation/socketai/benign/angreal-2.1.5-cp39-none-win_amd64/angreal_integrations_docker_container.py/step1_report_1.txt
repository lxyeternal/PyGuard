  "purpose": "Importing classes 'Container' and 'Containers' from a module related to Docker integrations within the 'angreal' package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'angreal._integrations.docker.container' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with an unused import statement and a linter directive ('# ruff: noqa'). No suspicious or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement with a linter suppression comment. No data input, processing, or output occurs. The imported classes suggest Docker container management, but their usage is not shown here. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The presence of the linter comment is standard practice to suppress warnings, not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple import with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be part of a larger codebase where these classes might be used elsewhere.",
