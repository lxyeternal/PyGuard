  "purpose": "Import classes 'Container' and 'Containers' from 'angreal._integrations.docker.container' for Docker container management.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from 'angreal._integrations.docker.container'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; code only imports classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow; import is static with no runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of linter suppression comment '# ruff: noqa' is standard; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement with a linter suppression comment, involving classes related to Docker containers. No data input/output, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns are present. The import alone does not introduce security risks or malware. The scores across reports correctly reflect the benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero. A slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is acceptable but could be adjusted to zero for consistency. Overall, the code is safe and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, involving a straightforward import with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
