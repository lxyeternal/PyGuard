{
  "purpose": "The code is a simple Python script that reads environment variables and user input, then prints data. It appears benign with no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, stdin (user input)",
  "sinks": "Console output (print statements)",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables and stdin flows into print output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward without obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables and user input, then outputs data via print. No network activity, file operations, or suspicious functions are present. The code structure is simple and clear, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. Given the lack of malicious indicators, the malware score is set to 0. The security risk is minimal, assigned at 0.1, reflecting the benign nature. Confidence is high (0.9) due to the straightforward code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is very low, and the malware likelihood is negligible. The analysis confirms the code is safe for use.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
