{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script intended for demonstration or utility purposes, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input is gathered from environment variables and standard input methods; no external data sources are explicitly accessed.",
  "sinks": "Data is printed to the console and assigned to variables; no network connections or file writes are directly observed.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables and stdin flows into variables, then possibly outputs or logs; no clear data exfiltration paths are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code constructs are present. The code does not perform any obfuscated or overly complex operations.",
  "analysis": "The script reads environment variables and user input, assigns them to variables, and prints information. No network activity, file manipulation, or sensitive data handling is observed. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward logic suggests typical behavior. Lack of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious functions indicates a benign purpose. No anomalous or suspicious patterns are present in the code structure or content.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with no indicators of malware or supply chain attacks.",
