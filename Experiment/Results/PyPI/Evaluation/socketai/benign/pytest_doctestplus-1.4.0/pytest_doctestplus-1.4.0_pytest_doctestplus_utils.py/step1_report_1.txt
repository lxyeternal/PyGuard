{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for checking the existence and version compliance of Python modules and distributions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (module names/requirements).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly queries package metadata.",
  "flows": "Input requirements are parsed and checked against installed modules or distributions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code performs package inspection and version validation without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility methods to locate Python modules and distributions, handling exceptions to avoid crashes. It uses standard library functions and the 'packaging' module for requirement parsing. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is evident. The logic is straightforward, aimed at verifying module presence and version compliance. No anomalies or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for package verification with no malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely within the environment's package metadata, without external communications or sensitive data handling.",
