  "purpose": "Utility for checking the existence and version compliance of Python modules and distributions.",
  "sources": "Reads module names and version requirements from input parameters; uses importlib.util.find_spec and importlib.metadata.distribution to locate modules and distributions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code performs lookups and version checks without executing untrusted code or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (module/distribution strings) -> find_spec/distribution methods -> return module/distribution objects or None -> boolean check in 'check' method.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; exception handling is broad but typical; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python libraries to locate modules and verify their versions. It handles exceptions broadly, which is acceptable for such utility functions. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution of untrusted data is present. The logic is straightforward: attempt to find a module or distribution matching the requirement, and return True if found. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code's purpose is benign, and it does not contain obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for dependency verification with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
