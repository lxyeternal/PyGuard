  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The report states that the code is benign, standard, and performs package inspection without malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected. The code is a simple utility for checking module presence and versions.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard library usage, no malicious behavior, and low security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — very low, reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns. The slight security risk score is acceptable given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports; straightforward dependency checker.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Reiterates that the code is a standard utility with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion—benign, standard dependency verification code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code matches the description; no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low across all reports; the highest is 0.1, which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Logic & Reasoning:** The reports are consistent and correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — the code is a simple dependency checker with no security risks.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code relies solely on standard libraries and well-maintained packages.\n- No external network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n- The exception handling is broad but typical for such utility functions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessments and scores are accurate and reasonable. No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard utility for dependency verification with no security concerns.",
