{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to find Python modules and distributions, and to check their existence and version compatibility.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'module' in methods find_module, find_distribution, and check; internally, the code reads module names and version requirements.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code does not execute untrusted data or perform network operations. It only retrieves module info based on provided strings.",
  "flows": "Input 'module' flows into find_module and find_distribution methods; results influence the check method's boolean return. No data is sent externally or executed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code relies on standard library functions and packages without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code uses importlib and packaging modules to locate and verify Python packages and their versions. No code injection, data leakage, or system modification appears present. The exception handling is broad but standard for such operations. The methods perform straightforward lookups and comparisons without executing external or untrusted code, and no network activity or system commands are invoked. There are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a utility for module discovery and version checking without any evident malicious behavior or security risks. It operates within standard Python mechanisms and does not perform any harmful actions.",
