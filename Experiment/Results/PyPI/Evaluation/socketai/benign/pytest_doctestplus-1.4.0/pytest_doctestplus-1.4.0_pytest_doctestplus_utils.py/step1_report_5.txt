  "purpose": "To check for the existence and version compatibility of Python modules and distributions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input modules or distribution strings via the 'check' method parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to write or transmit data; it only performs module and distribution checks.",
  "flows": "Input string (module or distribution requirement) → find_module/find_distribution → return boolean result",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of 'importlib' and 'packaging' libraries appears standard. No dynamic code execution or external network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'ModuleChecker' that provides methods to locate modules and distributions based on provided strings. The 'find_module' method uses 'importlib.util.find_spec' to locate modules; the 'find_distribution' method uses 'packaging.requirements.Requirement' to parse requirements and 'importlib.metadata.distribution' to retrieve distribution info. The 'check' method combines these to verify if a module or distribution exists and matches the specified version constraints. All operations are standard library functions with no signs of malicious intent. No data leakage, external network calls, or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for verifying Python module and distribution presence with version constraints. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, purpose-specific module checker.",
