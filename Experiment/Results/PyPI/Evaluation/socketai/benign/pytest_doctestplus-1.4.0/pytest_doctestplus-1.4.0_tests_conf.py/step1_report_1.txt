  "sources": "Imports from 'datetime', list of extensions, configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external calls with untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'datetime.now().year' to dynamically set copyright info; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script. It imports 'datetime' to dynamically set the copyright year. The extensions list references only the official Sphinx extension. No input reading from external sources, no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no network calls, and no unsafe operations are present. The code structure is typical and straightforward for a config file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, typical configuration file for Sphinx documentation. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
