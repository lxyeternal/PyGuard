  "purpose": "Configuration for Sphinx documentation builder, specifying project info, extensions, paths, and themes.",
  "sources": "Import of 'datetime' from the standard library; no other input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; no data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely sets static configuration options.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'datetime.now().year' in a static configuration context; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with typical settings for extensions, paths, and theme. The only dynamic element is the use of 'datetime.now().year' for copyright years, which is a common practice. No external inputs, user data handling, or malicious code is present. The import of 'datetime' is from the standard library and used safely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign configuration script for Sphinx documentation. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present.",
