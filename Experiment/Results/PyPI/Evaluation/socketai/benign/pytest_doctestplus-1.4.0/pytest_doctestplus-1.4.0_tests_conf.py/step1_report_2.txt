  "purpose": "Configuration for the Sphinx documentation builder, defining project info, extensions, paths, and theme options.",
  "sources": "Imports from datetime module; project metadata and configuration variables; extension and path definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No data outputs, network communications, or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from source to sink are detected. The code only sets static configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with typical settings such as extensions, paths, and theme options. It imports datetime to dynamically set copyright years but does not use any untrusted inputs or external data sources. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present in the configuration. All code appears benign and typical for documentation setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation. No malicious or security risks are evident.",
