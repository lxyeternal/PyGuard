  "purpose": "Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder, setting up project info, extensions, and HTML options.",
  "sources": "import statement from datetime module, datetime.now() function call for dynamic copyright year.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The only dynamic data flow is from datetime.now() used to set the copyright string, which is a benign operation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of datetime.now() to generate a copyright string is standard and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical configuration file for Sphinx documentation with standard imports and settings. The only dynamic element is the use of datetime.now() to update the copyright year, which is normal and safe. No data leaks, external communications, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script for documentation generation with no malicious intent, no security risks, and no obfuscated or malicious code present.",
