  "purpose": "Standard Sphinx configuration script setting project info, extensions, paths, theme, and static paths.",
  "sources": "Imports 'datetime' from the standard library and uses 'datetime.now().year' for dynamic year setting.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external data sources, or network calls present.",
  "flows": "Static configuration with 'datetime.now().year' as a benign dynamic element; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'datetime.now().year' is common and benign; no suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard Sphinx configuration file. It imports only from the standard library and sets project parameters, extensions, and paths without any external or untrusted data. The dynamic year setting is a common pattern. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, with scores reflecting no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
