  "sources": "Reading environment variables and importing modules (os, setuptools).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input; setup function is used for package configuration.",
  "flows": "Importing os, then passing a file path to setup for version writing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a standard setup configuration without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and calls setuptools.setup() with a configuration to write version info to a specified file path. No user input, environment variable manipulation, or network activity is present. The code is minimal and straightforward, typical for package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with version control integration. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
