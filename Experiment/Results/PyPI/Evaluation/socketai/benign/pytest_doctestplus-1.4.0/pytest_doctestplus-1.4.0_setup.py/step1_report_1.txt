{
  "purpose": "Configure package setup with version management using setuptools and setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "os.environ (indirectly via os.path.join), setup() function call",
  "sinks": "setup() function invocation (potential execution point for package installation)",
  "flows": "No external input or untrusted data flow is apparent; the code solely sets up versioning information",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.path.join within a dictionary argument to setup(), which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and setuptools.setup to configure package installation. It specifies versioning via 'use_scm_version', directing setuptools_scm to write version info to a file within the package. No input sources, user data, or network activity is present. The code is minimal and appears standard for Python package setup, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, focused on version management. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign and standard usage pattern.",
