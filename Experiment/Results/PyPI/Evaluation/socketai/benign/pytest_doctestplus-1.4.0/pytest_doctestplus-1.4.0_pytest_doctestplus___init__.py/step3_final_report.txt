  "anomalies": "None",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard pattern for managing package versioning, involving a straightforward import of a version variable from a local module. There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code execution, or external data flows. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate given the simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard practice for version management with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The existing scores are justified and require no adjustment.",
