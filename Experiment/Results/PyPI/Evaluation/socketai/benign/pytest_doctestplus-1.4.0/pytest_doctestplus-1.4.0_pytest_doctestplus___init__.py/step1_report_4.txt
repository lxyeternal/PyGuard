  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Importing version attribute from local module; no data flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for package versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'version' attribute from a local module '.version' and assigns it to '__version__'. This is a common practice in Python packages to keep version info in a dedicated module. There are no suspicious patterns, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no external data sources or sinks. The code is minimal and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
