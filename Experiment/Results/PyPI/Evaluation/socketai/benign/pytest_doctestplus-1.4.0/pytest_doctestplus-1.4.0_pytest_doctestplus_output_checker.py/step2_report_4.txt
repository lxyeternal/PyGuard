  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security implications, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies that the code extends `doctest.OutputChecker` for output normalization, floating point comparison, and string adjustments. No suspicious behavior is noted.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code manipulates output strings via regex, performs float comparisons with `isclose`, and optionally uses numpy. All operations are within the scope of testing utilities.\n\n- **Malware/Obfuscation:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score = 0 is appropriate. Security risk = 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes the code's role in output normalization, floating point handling, and safe use of regex and optional numpy import. No suspicious external data or system actions.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's purpose is solely output normalization for testing. No external data sources, network calls, or file operations are involved.\n\n- **Malware/Obfuscation:** No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.1 (possibly considering the optional numpy import, but even that is standard).\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, highlights the normalization functions, safe regex usage, and float comparison. No malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's design is to improve test robustness, not to perform any harmful actions.\n\n- **Malware/Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.0-0.1 (given the optional numpy import, but that is standard practice).\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on normalization of output strings and float comparisons, with no external or malicious actions.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's flow is limited to string normalization and comparison, typical for testing utilities.\n\n- **Malware/Obfuscation:** No suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.1 (again, the optional numpy import is standard and not malicious).\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing normalization, float comparison, and numpy usage. No malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** All operations are within testing scope, with no external system interactions.\n\n- **Malware/Obfuscation:** No signs of malicious code.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.0-0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a testing utility for output normalization, not a malicious or obfuscated piece.\n\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently 0 across reports, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any network, file, or system modifications.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, which is correct. The code is clear and purpose-specific.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Generally low (around 0.1), justified by the optional numpy import and regex manipulations, both standard in testing utilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the analysis:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (minimal, mostly due to optional dependencies and regex use, which are standard)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' assessments are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior. No modifications are necessary. The code is a safe, well-defined testing utility extension.",
