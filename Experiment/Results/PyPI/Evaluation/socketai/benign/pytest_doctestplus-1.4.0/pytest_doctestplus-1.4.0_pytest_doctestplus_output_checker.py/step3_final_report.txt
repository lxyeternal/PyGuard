{
  "purpose": "A custom doctest.OutputChecker extension that normalizes string literals, removes suffixes, handles numpy dtype strings, and compares floating point values numerically rather than by string representation.",
  "sources": "Input strings 'want' and 'got', regex patterns, optional numpy import for numerical comparison.",
  "sinks": "Internal string processing, regex substitutions, float comparisons; no external or system sinks.",
  "flows": "Input strings -> regex normalization -> float parsing -> comparison functions -> output normalization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation; regex and float handling are standard for testing utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code extends doctest.OutputChecker for output normalization, including string literal adjustments, dtype string modifications, and float comparisons with tolerance. It uses regex for string modifications and optionally numpy for numerical closeness checks. No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious system modifications are present. The code's purpose is solely for testing output correctness, with no malicious intent or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-specific extension for output normalization in doctests. It performs string and float normalization without any malicious or obfuscated components. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0, with high confidence in safety.",
