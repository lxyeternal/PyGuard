  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states that the code is a custom output checker for doctest, handling normalization, floating point comparison, and string adjustments. Sources are internal strings, regex, and optional numpy.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or dangerous sinks; data flows are within string processing and comparison functions.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity; heavy use of regex for normalization is standard. Numpy import is optional and used solely for numerical comparison.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purpose-built extension for testing. No malware or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 (full confidence in safety).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, focusing on normalization and float comparison.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network/system commands; internal normalization flows.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; regex and numpy usage are standard for output normalization.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purpose-specific code. No malicious intent.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (high confidence).\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar purpose, normalization for testing outputs, float comparisons, numpy usage.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or dangerous sinks; data processed internally.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; uses standard regex and comparison functions.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign extension for doctest.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, normalization, float comparison, numpy.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or system commands.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity; standard regex and float comparison logic.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Purposeful, safe code for testing.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with previous, normalization and float comparison.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious sinks.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; standard regex and optional numpy usage.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate testing utility, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is solely for output normalization and comparison in testing contexts.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard techniques. No obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The code's purpose is to facilitate testing, with no external or system-impacting actions. The only minor concern could be regex manipulations, but these are standard and benign in this context.\n\n**Estimated final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (very low; primarily the potential for misuse if inputs are untrusted, but in testing contexts, this is minimal)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a safe, purpose-built extension for doctest output normalization and comparison. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk components. The high confidence scores from reports support this conclusion.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No security concern. The code is benign and suitable for use in testing environments.",
