  "purpose": "Define a hook function for pytest to handle doctest differences",
  "sources": "No input reading or data fetching sources present in the code",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified",
  "flows": "No data flow present, as the function is empty and contains only a docstring",
  "anomalies": "Lack of implementation; only a placeholder function with a docstring and license comment",
  "analysis": "The code includes a license comment and a single function definition with no implementation. It appears to be a placeholder for a pytest hook. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code does not perform any operations or data processing, thus presenting no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple placeholder function with no functionality, malicious intent, or security risks. It is likely part of a larger test suite setup and contains no malicious or suspicious activity.",
