  "purpose": "Placeholder function for pytest hook, likely used in testing or documentation validation.",
  "sources": "No data sources; function contains only a docstring and no implementation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; function is a stub with no logic.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of implementation, no data handling, no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, benign placeholder for a pytest hook, with no logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as non-malicious, with no signs of obfuscation or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pytest hook placeholder with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
