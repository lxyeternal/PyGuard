  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the validity of their conclusions, scores, and assumptions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a placeholder or hook function for pytest, with no implementation, data handling, or external interactions.\n- The code is minimal, with only a license comment and a function with a docstring.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is a benign placeholder with no logic or data handling.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, security risk:** All scores are 0, which is accurate.\n- **Behavior:** No data flows, no external inputs/outputs, no suspicious patterns.\n\n### Potential errors or flaws in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and placeholder in nature.\n- No overestimations or underestimations are apparent.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; there's no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely a stub with no logic, data handling, or external interactions, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The reports' confidence levels are high, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The code's purpose as a pytest hook placeholder is standard practice and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\nThe code is a simple, benign placeholder function intended as a pytest hook, with no malicious or security concerns. The reported scores and reasoning are appropriate and justified.",
