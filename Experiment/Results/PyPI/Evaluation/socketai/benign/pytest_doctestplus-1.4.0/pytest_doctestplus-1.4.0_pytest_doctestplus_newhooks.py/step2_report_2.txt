  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code snippets are minimal, consisting of a single function with only a docstring and no implementation logic. There are no data flows, no external interactions, and no handling of untrusted data. The code is a placeholder for a pytest hook, likely used in testing or documentation validation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The analysis appropriately notes the lack of implementation and data handling.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the clear and straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or vulnerabilities, risk scores higher than 0.5 are unjustified. The current scores are reasonable.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is zero across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious intent or activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as a placeholder with no logic or data handling.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThe code is a benign, standard placeholder for a pytest hook, with no security concerns.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nI concur with the reports' assessments. No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions. The code is safe, and the reports accurately reflect its benign nature.",
