  "purpose": "Define a hook function for pytest that handles diff output, likely used in testing or documentation validation.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, especially untrusted data handling, are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function is a placeholder with no implementation.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, with no complex or suspicious logic; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single function definition with a descriptive docstring. It lacks any logic, data handling, or external interactions that could indicate malicious activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The license comment at the top references open-source licensing but does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, placeholder function with no malicious or suspicious content. It appears to serve as a hook for pytest to handle diff outputs, with no indications of malware or security risks.",
