{
  "purpose": "The function appears to be a hook for pytest to handle diffs in doctests, likely used for testing and development purposes.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink since the function body is empty.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and contains only a function definition with no implementation or suspicious behavior; no anomalous or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a license comment and a single function that serves as a pytest hook. The function is empty and does not perform any operations. There are no data inputs, no processing, and no outputs. The absence of logic reduces the risk of malicious behavior. The code appears to be standard boilerplate or a placeholder for future implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a stub for a pytest hook with no active functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks present.",
