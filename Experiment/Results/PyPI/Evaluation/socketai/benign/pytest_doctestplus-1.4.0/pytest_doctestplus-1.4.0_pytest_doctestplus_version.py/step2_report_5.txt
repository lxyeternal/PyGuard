  "review": "Let's carefully analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code Review of the Original Snippet:**\n\n- The code is a standard auto-generated version file by `setuptools_scm`.\n- It conditionally imports type hints for static analysis (`TYPE_CHECKING`) and sets version variables (`__version__`, `version`, `__version_tuple__`, `version_tuple`) with fixed, hardcoded values.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, or external data handling is present.\n- The code's purpose is purely to define version metadata, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n**2. Review of the Reports:**\n\n- All five reports consistently state that the code is boilerplate, auto-generated, and benign.\n- They mention no untrusted data sinks, no external data flows, and no suspicious behaviors.\n- The analysis in each report aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, reflecting no malicious activity.\n\n**3. Logical Consistency and Scores:**\n\n- The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the analysis.\n- No report claims or implies any suspicious or malicious intent.\n- The code is typical for package versioning and is safe.\n\n**4. Critical Evaluation:**\n\n- There are no hidden behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` and static assignment is standard practice.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code does not process untrusted data.\n\n**5. Final Assessment and Recommendations:**\n\n- The code is benign, with no security risks.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should be 0.\n- The risk score, reflecting potential security impact, should also be 0.\n\n**6. My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll evidence points to this being a standard, auto-generated version metadata file with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scores are appropriate and should not be changed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a typical, safe version information snippet generated by setuptools_scm. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.",
