{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm, primarily used for package version management and type checking.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables, including the import within the TYPE_CHECKING block.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sources or data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string and tuple to variables, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected; the code is standard version declaration boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports typing types during type checking and sets version-related variables to maintain package version information. It uses standard Python syntax and conventions without external input, malicious code, or obfuscation. The only potential concern is that the code runs during package setup but contains no malicious or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, boilerplate for package versioning, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
