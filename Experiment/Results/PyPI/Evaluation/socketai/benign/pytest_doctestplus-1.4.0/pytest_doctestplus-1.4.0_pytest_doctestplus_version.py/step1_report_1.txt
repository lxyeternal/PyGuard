{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and is intended for version tracking and metadata purposes.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples, and the import within the TYPE_CHECKING block.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no user input or external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A, as this code does not process untrusted data; it only sets static version variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; the code contains standard version assignment and conditional import based on type checking.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if TYPE_CHECKING is True to conditionally import typing components for static analysis purposes. It then sets version-related variables with fixed strings and tuples. There are no data flows involving untrusted input, no dynamic execution, and no hidden behaviors. All parts serve a clear purpose of defining version metadata, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign version information snippet automatically generated by setuptools_scm. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe to use.",
