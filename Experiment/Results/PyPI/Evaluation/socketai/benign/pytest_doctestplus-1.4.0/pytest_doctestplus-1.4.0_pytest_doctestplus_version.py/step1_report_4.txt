{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to manage and track package versions.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples, and import statements within a TYPE_CHECKING conditional block.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data handling; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignments are used.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and contains no unusual code patterns, obfuscated elements, or hardcoded secrets. It is a standard versioning setup.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version-related variables using static strings and tuples. The import statement is conditional on TYPE_CHECKING, which is a common pattern for type hinting. No input, no data leaks, no external communication, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be auto-generated by setuptools_scm and is intended solely for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign versioning utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets version information for the package.",
