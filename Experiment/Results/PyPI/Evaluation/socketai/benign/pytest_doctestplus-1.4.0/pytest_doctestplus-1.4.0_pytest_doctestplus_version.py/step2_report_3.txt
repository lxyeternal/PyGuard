  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, auto-generated version file created by setuptools_scm. It conditionally imports typing components for type checking and sets version variables (`__version__`, `version`, `__version_tuple__`, `version_tuple`) to static, hardcoded values ('1.4.0' and (1, 4, 0)). There are no dynamic behaviors, no external data handling, and no user input processing.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, the code is straightforward and does not exhibit any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No, the code is a standard boilerplate for version info, generated by a well-known tool. It follows common conventions.\n\n- **Scores given in reports:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n1. **Malware Score:**  \n   The reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions, dynamic code execution, or external communications.\n\n2. **Obfuscated:**  \n   The code is not obfuscated; it is clear and straightforward.\n\n3. **Risk Score:**  \n   The risk score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n   - The code does not process untrusted data.\n   - No hidden or suspicious logic.\n   - No obfuscation or code that could be exploited.\n\n5. **Any inconsistencies?**  \n   No. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a boilerplate versioning file, generated automatically, with no malicious intent.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, standard, and safe. All reports correctly identify it as such. No further action or concern is warranted.",
