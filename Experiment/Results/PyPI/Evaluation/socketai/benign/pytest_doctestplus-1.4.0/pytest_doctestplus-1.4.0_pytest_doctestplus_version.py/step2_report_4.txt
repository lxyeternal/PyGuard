  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code Review of the Original Snippet:**\n\nThe code is a standard auto-generated version file by `setuptools_scm`. It defines version variables, uses conditional import for type checking, and assigns static version strings and tuples. There are no dynamic behaviors, no external data handling, and no obfuscation.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as boilerplate, benign, and standard for package versioning.\n- They correctly identify that there are no data flows involving untrusted input, no external data, and no suspicious behaviors.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.\n\n3. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; they do not contain any apparent logical errors or misinterpretations.\n- They correctly interpret the purpose and behavior of the code.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond what the code logically supports.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version metadata snippet with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n6. **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign, standard nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is safe, non-malicious, and typical for package versioning.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed in scoring or interpretation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis supply chain component poses no security risk, malware, or obfuscation concerns. It is a straightforward, auto-generated version info file.",
