  "purpose": "Define static version information for the package, generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version strings and tuples, conditional import for type checking.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assigned directly to variables.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, boilerplate code with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated version file, with static version strings and tuples, and conditional type hint imports. It contains no dynamic code, external data, or user input handling. All reports correctly identify it as benign, boilerplate, and safe, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or contain hidden behaviors. The scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard version metadata snippet with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The existing scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and require no change.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
