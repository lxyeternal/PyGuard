{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and manages version variables.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables, import statement under TYPE_CHECKING conditional.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flow from untrusted sources, no external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; all assignments are static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard auto-generated version info file with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version information using hardcoded strings and tuples, with conditional import statements based on TYPE_CHECKING for type hints. There are no external inputs, data leaks, or malicious behaviors present. The structure is typical for auto-generated version files from setuptools_scm. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated version definition file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
