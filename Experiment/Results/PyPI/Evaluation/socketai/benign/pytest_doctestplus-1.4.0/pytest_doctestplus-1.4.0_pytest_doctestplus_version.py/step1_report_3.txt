{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a package, generated by setuptools_scm, and includes type hints and version tuple assignments.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ and version), and the import statement within the TYPE_CHECKING block.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or input; no execution or data flow that involves external or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; the code merely assigns static version information.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a standard pattern for version handling with no suspicious or unusual constructs. The use of TYPE_CHECKING and type hints is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated version file created by setuptools_scm. It defines version-related variables, with a conditional import for type checking purposes. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code's structure and content are consistent with normal package version metadata management.",
  "conclusion": "There is no malicious behavior, no security risks, and the code is straightforward version information assignment. It appears to be a safe, standard generated file for package versioning.",
