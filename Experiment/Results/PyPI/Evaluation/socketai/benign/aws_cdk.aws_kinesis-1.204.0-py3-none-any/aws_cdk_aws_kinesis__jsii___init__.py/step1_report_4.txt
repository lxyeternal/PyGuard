{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an import and setup script for an AWS CDK module related to Kinesis, primarily for infrastructure as code (IaC) deployment.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and package metadata, including jsii assembly load information.",
  "targets": "There are no explicit sinks for untrusted data or code execution points within this script.",
  "flows": "The code loads modules and metadata necessary for AWS CDK constructs, with no evident source-to-sink data flows that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses jsii to load a compiled assembly and publishes it via publication.publish(). No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles module imports and assembly loading for the AWS CDK library, with no user input handling, no network communication, and no suspicious code behavior. The use of __jsii_assembly__ to load a specific version of an AWS CDK module and publishing it does not indicate malicious activity. All imports are standard for AWS infrastructure code, and there are no signs of hardcoded secrets, data leakage, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for AWS CDK constructs, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a CDK-based infrastructure deployment process.",
