{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and imports modules related to the napalm network automation library, verifies Python version compatibility, and retrieves the napalm package version.",
  "sources": "Reading system information (__version__), importing various napalm modules, and retrieving package version using pkg_resources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network communications, file writes, or execution of untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and version checks are straightforward; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The only data flow is from package info and environment to internal variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. All imports are standard for a network library setup. The version check is a normal compatibility check.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs module imports, Python version validation, and retrieves package version info. All operations are standard and do not involve untrusted data inputs or potentially malicious operations. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard setup and initialization script for the napalm network automation library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code.",
