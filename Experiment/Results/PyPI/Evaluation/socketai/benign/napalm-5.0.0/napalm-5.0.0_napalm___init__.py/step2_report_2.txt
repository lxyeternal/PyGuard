  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is standard initialization logic with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code performs typical environment checks, module imports, and version retrieval.\n- No untrusted data sources, network activity, or file operations that could be malicious are identified.\n- The malware scores are all zero, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n### Report 1\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is standard setup.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, risk=0.1. The small risk score is acceptable given minimal environment checks.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely setup; no reason to increase risk or malware scores.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** Safe initialization, no suspicious activity.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** Standard version check and module import.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** Typical setup code.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All zero, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable for such setup code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk associated with environment checks and module imports, which are standard.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No adjustments are necessary.",
