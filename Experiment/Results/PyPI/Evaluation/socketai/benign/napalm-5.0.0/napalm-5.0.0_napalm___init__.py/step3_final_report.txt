{
  "purpose": "Initialize the napalm package by importing necessary modules, verifying Python version, and retrieving package version information.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version, pkg_resources.get_distribution for package version, static module imports for napalm drivers",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs, no network or file operations",
  "flows": "N/A - static setup code without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward environment setup, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard environment validation and module imports for the napalm library. It checks Python version >= 3.7, retrieves package version safely with fallback, and imports driver modules to prevent threading issues. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and adheres to best practices for setup routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
