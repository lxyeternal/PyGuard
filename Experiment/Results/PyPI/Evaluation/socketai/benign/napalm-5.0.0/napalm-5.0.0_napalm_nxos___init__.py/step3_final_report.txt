  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package, importing necessary modules, retrieving package version information, and defining exported classes.",
  "sources": "pkg_resources.get_distribution() call to retrieve package metadata",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output external data",
  "flows": "Retrieving package version (source) to setting __version__ (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package setup code with standard practices",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package initialization script that imports standard modules, safely retrieves package version info, and defines exports. It contains no suspicious or malicious patterns, no obfuscated code, and performs no network or data handling. The version retrieval is a common, safe operation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code's purpose is solely to set up package metadata and exports, with no external inputs or outputs that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free from malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate a safe package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
