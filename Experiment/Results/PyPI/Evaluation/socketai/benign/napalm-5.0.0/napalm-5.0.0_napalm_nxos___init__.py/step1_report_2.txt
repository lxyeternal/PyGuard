  "purpose": "This code initializes the napalm.nxos package, imports necessary modules, and sets the package version.",
  "sources": "pkg_resources.get_distribution('napalm-nxos').version",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data processing or output is present.",
  "flows": "Source (package version retrieval) to no further sinks or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard package initialization and version retrieval code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard library modules and local modules, then attempts to retrieve the package version using pkg_resources. It handles the case where the package is not installed by setting the version to 'Not installed'. There are no external inputs, user data, or sensitive data handling. The structure is typical for Python package initialization files, with no suspicious or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
