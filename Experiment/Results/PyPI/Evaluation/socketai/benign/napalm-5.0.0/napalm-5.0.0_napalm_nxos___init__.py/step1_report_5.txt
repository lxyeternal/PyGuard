{
  "purpose": "This module appears to initialize and expose classes for the napalm.nxos package, primarily importing and defining module metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version using pkg_resources.get_distribution and imports classes from local modules.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the assignment of __version__, which stores the package version; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "The source (package version retrieval) flows into the __version__ variable without any further processing or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present. The code strictly handles module setup and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and local modules, sets a version string based on package distribution info, and defines exported classes. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscated logic. The version fetching is standard practice for package metadata. No user input, external data processing, or network operations are present. The code is straightforward and consistent with typical package initialization scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing typical package setup and metadata management. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
