  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard package initialization script that imports modules, retrieves version info via `pkg_resources.get_distribution()`, and exports classes.\n- No report indicates any suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code.\n- The code does not process user input, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data.\n- The `pkg_resources.get_distribution()` call is a common pattern for retrieving package version metadata and is generally safe.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code's purpose is purely to set up package metadata and export classes.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The version retrieval is handled with exception handling, which is standard practice.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is reasonable.\n- The confidence score is 1 across all reports, indicating high certainty of benignity.\n- The malware score is 0, consistent with the code's content.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly reflecting the lack of obfuscation.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- There are no signs of supply chain attack vectors, malicious code, or vulnerabilities.\n- The code is typical for package setup and does not introduce any security risks.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, safe package initialization script.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the actual code content.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The scores reflect this accurately.",
