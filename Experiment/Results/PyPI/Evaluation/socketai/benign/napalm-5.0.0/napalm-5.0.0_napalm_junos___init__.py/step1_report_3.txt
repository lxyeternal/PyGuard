  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks related to untrusted data or output in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The only flow is the static import of a module, with no runtime data flows or user input handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. The license comments are standard licensing notices.",
