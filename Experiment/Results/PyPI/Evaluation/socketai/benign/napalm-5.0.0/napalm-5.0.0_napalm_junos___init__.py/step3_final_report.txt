{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal package header with licensing information and imports a local module, likely for package initialization.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from napalm.junos.junos import JunOSDriver' reads from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process external input or perform actions that could leak data.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present; the code is static and only imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple license header followed by a single import statement, with no dynamic behavior, data processing, or network activity. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No further analysis or action is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package header with a straightforward import statement. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The current scores are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
