  "flows": "File read -> regex substitution -> YAML safe_load -> FactoryLoader.load",
  "anomalies": "Replaces 'unicode' with 'str' in YAML files; this is a harmless preprocessing step for Python 3 compatibility",
  "analysis": "The code reads a YAML file derived from the script's filename, modifies it by replacing 'unicode' with 'str', and then loads it using a factory loader with safe YAML parsing. There is no evidence of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity. The replacement of 'unicode' with 'str' is a compatibility fix and does not introduce security issues. The use of safe_load() further minimizes risk. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward data loader with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign YAML loader with a simple preprocessing step for compatibility. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
