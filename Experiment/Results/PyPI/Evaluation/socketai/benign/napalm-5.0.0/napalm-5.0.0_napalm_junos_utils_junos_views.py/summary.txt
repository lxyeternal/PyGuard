  "conclusion": "The code is a benign YAML configuration loader with a minor compatibility fix. No malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation is present. The low security risk score is justified given the minimal potential for misuse, especially with safe_load(). The regex substitution, while potentially exploitable if YAML content is malicious, does not pose significant risk in this context. Overall, the script is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
