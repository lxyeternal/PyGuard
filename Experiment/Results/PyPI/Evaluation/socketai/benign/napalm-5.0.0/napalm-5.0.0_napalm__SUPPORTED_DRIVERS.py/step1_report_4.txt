  "purpose": "Define a list of supported network driver names",
  "sources": "The list of string literals assigned to SUPPORTED_DRIVERS",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external effects are present",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code declares a list of supported driver names as string literals. There are no dynamic inputs, no external data processing, no code execution, nor any potentially malicious constructs. The list appears to serve as a configuration or constant for supported drivers. The structure and content are simple and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign declaration of supported driver names, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
