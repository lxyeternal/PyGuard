  "purpose": "Define a list of supported driver names for network devices or systems.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading; the code solely defines a static list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling; no processing of untrusted data or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the list is a static constant.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple list definition with no unusual constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of supported driver names as string literals. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external interactions, and no suspicious patterns. The list appears to be used for configuration or validation within a larger application context. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign list of driver names used for supporting different network device types. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
