  "purpose": "Define a list of supported network driver names.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded list of driver names assigned to SUPPORTED_DRIVERS.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static data assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward list definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of supported driver strings, which appears to be a static configuration. There are no inputs, no dynamic execution, no external data, or code that could be malicious. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The list simply enumerates driver names, likely used elsewhere in the larger project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple static list definition with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is a benign configuration snippet.",
