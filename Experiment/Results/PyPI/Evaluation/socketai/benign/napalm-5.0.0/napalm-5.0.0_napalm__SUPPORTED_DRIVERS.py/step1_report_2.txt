  "purpose": "Defines a list of supported network driver identifiers",
  "sources": "None; the list is hardcoded and does not read external input",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output functions present",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from external sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "List appears straightforward, no signs of obfuscation or hidden code",
  "analysis": "The code declares a list of driver names related to network hardware or software components. It is static data with no dynamic or external data handling, no user input, no configuration reading, and no code execution. There are no apparent security issues or malicious indicators such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple static list definition with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves as a configuration or constant list within a larger program.",
