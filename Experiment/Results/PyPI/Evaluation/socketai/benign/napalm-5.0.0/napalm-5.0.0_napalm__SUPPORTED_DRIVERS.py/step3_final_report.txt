  "purpose": "A static list of supported driver names used for configuration or reference within a larger system.",
  "sources": "The list is a hardcoded array of string literals defining driver names.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external outputs; the code does not process untrusted input or write data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static list of driver names with no dynamic behavior, input handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static list with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the current scoring reflects the code's safety. No modifications are needed.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
