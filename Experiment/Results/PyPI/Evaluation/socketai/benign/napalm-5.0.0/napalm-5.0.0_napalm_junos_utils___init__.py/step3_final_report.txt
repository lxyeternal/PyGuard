{
  "purpose": "This code snippet contains only a UTF-8 encoding declaration, serving as metadata for Python files.",
  "sources": "The encoding declaration comment itself; no external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions are present in this minimal code.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code does not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is a simple encoding comment with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line comment specifying UTF-8 encoding, which is standard boilerplate in Python files. It contains no executable logic, data inputs, or outputs. All previous reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are present, and the code does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is harmless, containing only a standard encoding declaration. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
