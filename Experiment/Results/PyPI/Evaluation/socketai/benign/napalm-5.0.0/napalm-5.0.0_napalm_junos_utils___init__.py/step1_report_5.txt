{
  "purpose": "The code specifies encoding for the Python source file but does not perform any other operations or define functions.",
  "sources": "The only source is the file header comment specifying utf-8 encoding.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present as no executable or data handling code exists.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable due to lack of executable statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a minimal file with only an encoding declaration and no actual logic, functions, or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a single line comment indicating UTF-8 encoding for the source file. There is no executable code, no data input, no data processing, and no interaction with external systems. This minimal content presents no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The encoding declaration is standard and harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely a file encoding declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security threat.",
