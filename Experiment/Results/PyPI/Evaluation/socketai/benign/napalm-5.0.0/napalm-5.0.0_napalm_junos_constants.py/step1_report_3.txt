  "purpose": "Define constants and mappings related to JunOS driver and network configurations for use within the napalm library.",
  "sources": "Static string definitions, imported constants from napalm.base.constants",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing or output",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only establishes mappings and constants",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants, then defines several dictionaries and constants for network configurations and device capabilities. All data is static, well-structured, and documented. No user input handling, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be standard, configuration-related definitions without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of constant definitions and mappings relevant to network device configuration. No malicious behavior, no signs of supply chain attacks, and no security risks detected.",
