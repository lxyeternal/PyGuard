{
  "purpose": "Define constants and mappings related to JunOS driver functionality, including OpenConfig model types and LLDP capabilities.",
  "sources": "Import statement from napalm.base.constants and the defined constant dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No sink points or untrusted data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows or processing logic; only static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code solely contains static constant definitions and a standard import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants from an external module, then defines several dictionaries and constants related to network configurations and capabilities. There are no data inputs, no processing, no execution logic, and no code that interacts with external sources or untrusted inputs. The dictionaries appear to be static mappings used for configuration purposes. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of static constant definitions and an import statement, serving as configuration data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this code snippet.",
