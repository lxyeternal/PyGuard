  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code snippets are simple constant definitions and mappings.\n- All reports correctly identify the code as static configuration data with no dynamic or external data handling.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs are evident.\n- The import statement uses a wildcard (`from napalm.base.constants import *`), which is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review per report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identified as static constants and mappings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All agree that the code is benign, purely static, and configuration-related.\n- **Confidence & Scores:** Confidence is 1, malware and security risk are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The use of wildcard import (`from napalm.base.constants import *`) could be flagged as a style concern but not a security risk.\n- No evidence of supply chain attack or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Justification of scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 is correct; no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Any inconsistencies or adjustments?\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The only minor point is the wildcard import, which could be flagged as a coding style issue but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Additional comments:**\n- The code is safe, static, and intended for configuration purposes.\n- No changes needed to the scores based on the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary. The only note is the wildcard import, which is a style concern but not a security issue.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Confirm that the scores remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- No further security review needed for this code snippet.",
