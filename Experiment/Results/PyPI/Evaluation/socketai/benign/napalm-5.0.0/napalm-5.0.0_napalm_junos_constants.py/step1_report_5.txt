{
  "purpose": "Define constants and mappings related to JunOS driver functionality, including OpenConfig mappings and capability tables.",
  "sources": "Static data structures (dictionaries and string constants); import statement for constants from an external module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only establishes static mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The import statement uses a wildcard which can be considered poor practice but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines static constants and mappings used for network device configuration or interpretation. It imports from a base constants module, which could contain more relevant data, but within this snippet, no malicious behavior is evident. The mappings appear to be straightforward lookups without any dynamic execution or external input. The import with a wildcard could potentially import unintended variables, but this is a coding style concern, not malicious. Overall, the code appears to serve configuration purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only static data definitions and a simple import statement. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign configuration snippet.",
