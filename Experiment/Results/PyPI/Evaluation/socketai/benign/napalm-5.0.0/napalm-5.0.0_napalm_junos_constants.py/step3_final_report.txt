{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and mappings related to JunOS driver configuration, including OpenConfig types, LLDP capabilities, and null level indicator.",
  "sources": "Static constant definitions and mappings within the code; import from napalm.base.constants",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration data with no external input or output",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static data assignments",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (`from napalm.base.constants import *`) which is a style concern but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is static, configuration-related, and contains no dynamic or external data processing. It imports from a trusted library, defines constants and mappings, and does not perform any data manipulation or network operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The wildcard import is a style issue but does not impact security. All signals indicate benign static configuration data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, static, and intended solely for configuration purposes. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The supply chain risk is negligible, and the current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.",
