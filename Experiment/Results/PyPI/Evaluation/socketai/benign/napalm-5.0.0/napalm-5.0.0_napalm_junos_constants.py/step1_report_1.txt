  "purpose": "Define constants and mappings for the JunOS driver used in network automation.",
  "sources": "Imports from napalm.base.constants, and local constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or user input processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; purely static data definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static constant definitions, including mappings for OpenConfig network types and LLDP capabilities. It imports from a trusted library (napalm.base.constants), which is a standard dependency in network automation. No user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears well-structured and straightforward, serving configuration and mapping purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, containing only static constant definitions and mappings related to JunOS driver configuration. There is no evidence of malware or security issues.",
