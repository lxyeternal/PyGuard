  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, reading dependencies and description files, and defining package metadata and CLI entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies and 'README.md' for long description; static strings for metadata; defines CLI commands via 'entry_points'.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows; no network calls or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Static file reads during setup; no runtime data flows or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies; author emails are hardcoded but typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. It reads dependencies and description from local files, defines package metadata, and CLI commands. No external network activity or code injection points are present. The 'entry_points' invoke functions within the package, which is standard for CLI tools, not suspicious. Author emails are typical package metadata. Overall, the script is benign and aligns with common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign 'setup.py' script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
