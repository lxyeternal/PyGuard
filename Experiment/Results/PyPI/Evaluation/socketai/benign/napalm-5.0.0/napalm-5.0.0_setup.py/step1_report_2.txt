{
  "purpose": "This setup.py file configures the packaging, dependencies, and entry points for the napalm project, facilitating installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements from 'requirements.txt', reading long description from 'README.md', and static string assignments for author info and package metadata.",
  "targets": "Potential data leaks if author or email information is maliciously altered, or if external inputs are used insecurely (not in this code).",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow present; static files are read and used internally, with no dynamic or external input affecting code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic behaviors are present. The code is standard setup script with no hidden mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The script reads dependencies from a requirements file and long description from a markdown file. It defines package metadata and entry points for CLI tools. All actions are static and typical for Python package setup. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious logic detected. The author and contact details are explicitly set and are not used dynamically.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package without malicious intent or security risks. There are no signs of malware or suspicious behavior.",
