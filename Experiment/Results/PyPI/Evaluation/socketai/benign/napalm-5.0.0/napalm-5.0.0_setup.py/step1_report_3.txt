{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'napalm' Python project, configuring dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reading 'README.md' for long description, and static metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or executes untrusted data; no external sinks like network or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Reads dependencies and long description from files; no untrusted data flows into code execution or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs detected. Author emails are publicly available but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures: reading dependency list from a requirements file, loading a markdown file for description, and calling setuptools.setup with static metadata. No dynamic code execution, no input from untrusted sources, and no malicious logic are present. It follows common Python packaging practices without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It solely handles package configuration and metadata.",
