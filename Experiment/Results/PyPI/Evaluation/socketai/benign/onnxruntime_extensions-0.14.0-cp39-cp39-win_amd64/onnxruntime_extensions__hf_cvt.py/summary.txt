  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility for tokenizer conversion with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is minimal, justified by standard file handling and data processing. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical low-level risks associated with file I/O in such utilities."
