  "purpose": "Utility functions for ONNX model processing, file handling, Mel-filterbank computation, and graph cleanup/merging.",
  "sources": "File system operations, inspect module for current file, numpy for computations, onnx for model graph manipulations.",
  "sinks": "None; functions do not write untrusted data to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "File paths are constructed from current file location; model graphs are modified internally; no external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard utility functions for signal processing and ONNX model graph management. It performs file I/O, mathematical computations, and graph cleanup without any network activity, code injection, or obfuscation. The model merging functions handle graph composition safely, and the constants removal functions ensure model integrity. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purpose-specific, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. It operates solely on models and files with standard libraries. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal potential misuse but no actual threat.",
