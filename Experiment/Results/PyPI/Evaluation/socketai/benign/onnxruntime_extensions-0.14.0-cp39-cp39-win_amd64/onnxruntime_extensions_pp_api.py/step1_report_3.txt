{
  "purpose": "The code provides wrappers around native C API functions for tokenization and image processing, facilitating integration with machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "os.path.isdir, os.path.exists, os.path.dirname, load_images, cached_file, create_tokenizer, create_processor, batch_tokenize, batch_detokenize, tensor_result_get_at, delete_object",
  "sinks": "create_tokenizer, create_processor, batch_tokenize, batch_detokenize, tensor_result_get_at, delete_object",
  "flows": "Input paths or data (tokenizer_dir, images, text) -> calls to create or load resources -> processing functions -> deletion of objects",
  "anomalies": "Use of __del__ methods for resource cleanup; reliance on external cached_file for tokenizer files; dynamic creation and deletion of native objects; no hardcoded secrets or obvious malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code safely wraps native C API functions for tokenization and image processing, handling resource management via __del__ methods. It verifies directory existence, utilizes transformers' cached_file for model files, and performs standard checks. No suspicious data flows or code injections are present. Use of delete_object suggests proper cleanup of native resources. The reliance on external libraries and standard file checks indicates typical design, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, functioning as a wrapper around native machine learning processing APIs with appropriate resource management and input validation. No malicious behavior or sabotage indicators are observed.",
