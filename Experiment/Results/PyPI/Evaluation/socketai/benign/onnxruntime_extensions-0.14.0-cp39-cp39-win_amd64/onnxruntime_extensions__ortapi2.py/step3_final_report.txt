{
  "purpose": "Provides utilities for ONNX model manipulation, including model extension, hooking, input expansion, and inference management.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., device info), loads models from file or object, and accesses model graph inputs/outputs.",
  "sinks": "Modifies model graphs, adds nodes, and creates or updates models; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Loads model -> modifies or extends graph -> sets up inference session -> runs inference with provided inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Version checks are standard; no malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility library for ONNX models, performing model extension, hooking, input expansion, and inference setup. It employs standard libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscation. Version checks and environment queries are benign. Functions like 'hook_model_op' and 'expand_onnx_inputs' are typical in model debugging and extension workflows. No suspicious or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility library for ONNX model handling and inference. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score (0.2) reflects potential misuse if models are untrusted, but this is inherent in such tools and not indicative of malicious activity.",
