  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the scores, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard ONNX model extension library with no malicious activity. It includes model modification, hooking, and inference functions, with proper version checks and safe API usage.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the benign nature.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code review. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing model management, hooks, and inference. It notes potential misuse if models are untrusted but clarifies that the code itself is standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — still low, justified.\n- **Assessment:** The functions for injecting nodes and modifying models are typical in model debugging or extension workflows. No malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on model modification, inference, and extension registration. No suspicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a utility library for ONNX models, with standard practices. No signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing model handling, inference, and safe API usage. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is a utility library for ONNX models, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The detailed analysis aligns with the code's functions and safe usage.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature. The code does not perform any network activity, system commands, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Ranging from 0.1 to 0.2, justified by the fact that model manipulation functions could be misused if models are untrusted, but the code itself is safe.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the functions involve model modification and inference, which could be misused in untrusted environments, a slightly higher risk score of **0.2** seems reasonable. However, since no malicious intent is evident, keeping it at **0.2** is acceptable.\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Estimate |\n|-------------------|----------------|\n| Malware           | 0              |\n| Obfuscated        | 0              |\n| Security Risk     | 0.2            |\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate utility library for ONNX model handling and inference, with no malicious or suspicious features.",
