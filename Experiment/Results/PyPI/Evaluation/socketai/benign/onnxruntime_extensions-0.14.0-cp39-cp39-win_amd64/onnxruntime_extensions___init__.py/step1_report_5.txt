{
  "purpose": "This source code provides an API for interacting with ONNX Runtime and custom operations, including model generation, inference, and extension registration.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules (_version, _ocos, _cuops, _ortapi2, cvt), conditional imports of onnx and onnxruntime, and environment handling for missing dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily loads modules and defines functions or raises exceptions if dependencies are missing.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code loads modules and defines functions, with no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import with try-except for optional dependencies; conditional function definitions raising NotImplementedError; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a package for ONNX Runtime extensions, carefully handling missing dependencies by defining placeholder functions. It imports several internal modules and conditionally exposes functionalities based on the environment. There are no indications of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. All operations appear consistent with standard package initialization and API exposure patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate open-source package setup for ONNX Runtime extensions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The structure and content are typical for a Python package managing optional dependencies and exposing APIs.",
