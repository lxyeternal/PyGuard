{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer for the 'onnxruntime-extensions' Python package, providing API functions, handling optional dependencies, and setting up module exports for model pre/post-processing and custom operation registration.",
  "sources": "Reads input from import statements, conditional dependency checks, and module attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present; the code primarily sets up internal module functions and handles optional dependencies.",
  "flows": "The code flows from import statements to conditional function definitions, setting module attributes, and exporting functions and classes, with no external data or untrusted inputs involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad import statements (`from ._cuops import *`) which can obscure imported functionalities but are common in SDKs; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK setup script that manages optional dependencies with try-except blocks, defines module exports, and conditionally assigns unimplemented functions if dependencies are missing. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The use of wildcard imports is typical in SDKs but can reduce clarity. The overall structure is straightforward, with no external data leaks or malicious activity. The low risk and malware scores are justified by the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, benign package initialization script for the 'onnxruntime-extensions' library. It handles dependencies gracefully, uses standard patterns, and contains no malicious or obfuscated code. The assigned scores (malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
