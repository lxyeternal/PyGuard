{
  "purpose": "This package provides APIs for working with ONNX models, including custom operation registration, model optimization, and inference.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (. _version, ._ocos, ._cuops, ._ortapi2, .cvt), environment checks for onnx and onnxruntime, and conditional definitions based on library availability.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks for untrusted data processing or network transmission are present; code mainly defines functions and imports modules.",
  "flows": "Conditional flow based on whether onnx and onnxruntime are installed; import and expose various functions accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or hidden code. Use of try-except for optional dependencies is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Python package for ONNX model handling. It includes license and author information, imports, and conditional definitions to handle missing dependencies gracefully. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The code manages optional dependencies, exposes functions appropriately, and adheres to standard package design. No anomalies or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, legitimate package initialization script for an ONNX extension library. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
