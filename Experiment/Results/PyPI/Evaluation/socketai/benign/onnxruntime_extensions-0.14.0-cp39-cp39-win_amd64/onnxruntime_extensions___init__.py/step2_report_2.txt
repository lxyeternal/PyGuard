  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard package initializer, importing modules, defining functions, and handling optional dependencies with try-except blocks. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity evident.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to optional dependency handling.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — very high, given the straightforward nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the standard package setup, conditional imports, and exception handling. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — appropriate, given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence in benign assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical package setup with conditional dependencies, no signs of malicious code. Use of `import *` is noted but common in SDKs.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — slightly elevated due to broad imports, but not malicious.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, standard structure, no suspicious activity, no external data flows involving untrusted sources.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, typical package initialization, optional dependencies handled gracefully, no malicious signs.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports consistently show no signs of malicious code or activity. The package is a legitimate SDK component for ONNX Runtime extensions.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Scores:** Appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature of the code. The small risk scores are justified by the use of broad imports and optional dependency handling, which are common in SDKs but not malicious.\n- **Potential Concerns:** The only minor concern is the use of `from ._cuops import *`, which can obscure imported functions, but this is typical in SDKs and not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0.0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0.0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign analysis, a slightly higher but still low score (e.g., **0.1**) is appropriate, reflecting the standard optional dependency handling and broad imports but no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, open-source SDK setup with no malicious or security-compromising behavior.",
