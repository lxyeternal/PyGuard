{
  "purpose": "The code provides an API for working with ONNX Runtime, enabling custom operations, model processing, and inference functions, primarily for model pre/post-processing and extension.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules (_version, _ocos, _cuops, _ortapi2, _cvt), dynamic imports of onnx and onnxruntime, and code that raises NotImplementedError if dependencies are missing.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows involving untrusted input; no network or file operations present; mainly internal function and class definitions.",
  "flows": "Code imports and assigns functions and classes, with conditional handling based on dependency availability; no untrusted data flow or external interaction identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except for import dependencies; conditional unimplemented functions that raise exceptions if dependencies are missing; no suspicious or malicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package entry point with conditional imports based on dependencies. It defines functions and classes for model processing and custom ops. There are no signs of code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The structure is typical for a Python package with fallback implementations when dependencies are missing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, serving as a framework for ONNX Runtime extensions and custom operations. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The only potential concern is the raising of NotImplementedError in absence of dependencies, which is normal for optional components.",
