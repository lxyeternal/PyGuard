  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and the provided information, and determine the accuracy of their assessments, potential risks, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is a standard package initialization for ONNX extensions, with no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and high confidence (1.0). It assigns malware score 0.0 and security risk 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code indeed is a typical setup script for a Python package, with conditional imports and placeholder functions if dependencies are missing. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The use of try-except and raising NotImplementedError for missing dependencies is standard.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are reasonable and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the code, with no suspicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Confidence is slightly lower (0.9), but still high.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code structure, conditional imports, and exception handling are typical. The only minor concern noted is the raising of NotImplementedError, which is standard for optional dependencies. No malicious patterns or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the use of wildcard imports (`from ._cuops import *`), which could mask hidden functionalities but are common in SDKs. No malicious behavior or suspicious activity detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The wildcard import is a potential concern in terms of code clarity and maintainability but not inherently malicious. The rest of the code aligns with standard SDK setup practices. No evidence of malicious intent.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; the security risk score of 0.1 is appropriate given the wildcard import but does not indicate malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the handling of dependencies, lack of data leaks, and standard structure. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or sabotage.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical SDK module with conditional loading, exception handling, and import statements. The wildcard imports are noted but not suspicious in this context.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a legitimate setup for ONNX Runtime extensions, with no malicious activity, and handles dependencies gracefully.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code structure, and no malicious patterns are detected.\n\n- **Verdict:** The scores and conclusions are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Check and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports correctly identify that there are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** None of the reports mention obfuscated code, and the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** The risk scores assigned are very low (0.1), which is appropriate given the code's benign nature. The only minor concern is the wildcard import (`from ._cuops import *`), which can obscure functionality but is common in SDKs and not malicious.\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.0.\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal risk due to wildcard import, but not malicious.\n\n**Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, standard SDK setup with no malicious intent or security risks.**",
