  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the validity of their claims, the accuracy of their scoring, and any potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard package initialization for ONNX Runtime extensions, with no malicious behaviors or anomalies detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies the code as a typical SDK setup, with no signs of malicious activity. The use of try-except for optional dependencies is standard. The low malware score aligns with the absence of suspicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the code, with conditional imports and exception handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly notes that the code is typical for a Python package with fallback implementations. The raising of NotImplementedError in missing dependencies is standard and not malicious.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard setup for an extension package, with conditional imports and exception handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n- **Analysis:** The use of 'import *' is noted, which can be considered poor practice but not malicious. The overall assessment aligns with the code's purpose.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the legitimate setup, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n- **Analysis:** The wildcard imports are a concern from a code clarity perspective but do not indicate malicious intent. The overall security assessment is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code as a legitimate package setup with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the code. This is reasonable, considering the code's purpose as a package initializer with standard patterns.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- The absence of any malicious activity or suspicious patterns aligns with the code's function as an open-source SDK setup script.\n- The only minor concern is the use of 'import *', which is not best practice but not malicious.\n\n### My Own Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no evidence of malicious intent)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (clear code, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard package setup)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, benign SDK initialization script with no security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
