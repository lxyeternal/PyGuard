  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the validity of their conclusions, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard package initialization for ONNX Runtime extensions, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code mainly sets up imports, conditional functions, and handles optional dependencies. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident. The malware score of 0.0 aligns with the absence of malicious code. The low risk score (0.1) is reasonable, considering the code's benign nature.  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard package setup, with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The code's use of try-except and conditional function definitions are typical for optional dependencies. No signs of malicious behavior. The risk score being zero is appropriate. The slightly lower confidence reflects cautious acknowledgment but remains justified.  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages module imports, dependencies, and raises NotImplementedError if dependencies are missing, with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis correctly notes the broad import statements and conditional functions. While 'import *' can sometimes mask hidden functionalities, in an SDK context, it's standard practice. No malicious activity is apparent. The low malware and risk scores are justified.  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, focusing on the package setup, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's observations align with the code's structure. The wildcard imports are noted but are typical in SDKs. No malicious intent is evident. The scores are appropriate.  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate setup for ONNX Runtime extensions, handling dependencies properly.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe conclusion is consistent with the code review. No malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns. The zero malware and risk scores are justified.  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code, with scores at 0.0.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0.0, which is consistent; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly very low (0.0 or 0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the code, with some being slightly cautious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — Slightly cautious due to broad imports and optional dependencies, but overall very low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard open-source SDK setup for ONNX Runtime extensions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
