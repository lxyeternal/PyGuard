      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for tokenizer and ONNX model processing with no embedded malicious code. The primary security concern is the use of trust_remote_code=True, which can execute untrusted code from remote repositories, posing a significant risk if the source is malicious. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. To mitigate risks, avoid using trust_remote_code=True with untrusted sources and ensure dependencies are secure."

The low security risk score (0.2) reflects potential misuse if models are untrusted, but this is inherent in such tools and not indicative of malicious activity."

The assigned scores (malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate extension component for ONNX Runtime, handling CUDA DLL loading and custom operator registration. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The main security consideration is the reliance on environment variables for DLL paths and execution of user-defined functions with untrusted inputs, which could be exploited if the environment is compromised. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting standard environmental risks without active malicious behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for defining custom operators with standard file I/O for model and vocabulary loading. No malware or malicious intent is present. The main security concern is the potential misuse if file paths are supplied from untrusted sources, which can be mitigated through input validation. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, though some overestimate the risk. Overall, the code is safe with standard practices, and no active threats are detected."
