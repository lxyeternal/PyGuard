  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of the version string `__version__ = \"0.14.0\"` with an auto-generated comment.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and typical for package versioning.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No reports identify any suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n   - The comments indicating auto-generation are standard and do not imply malicious intent.\n\n3. **Error or Flaws in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, auto-generated, and contains no security issues.\n   - No logical flaws or errors are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (high confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and the analysis.\n\n5. **Potential for Change in Scores**:\n   - Since all assessments agree on the benign nature, no score adjustments are necessary.\n   - The malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The risk score should stay at 0, as there's no indication of any security concern.\n\n6. **Overall Justification**:\n   - The code is a standard, auto-generated version string assignment.\n   - No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.\n   - The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**Final Evaluation & Recommendations**:\n- Based on the evidence, I concur with the reports' assessments.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at **0**.\n- No further action or deeper analysis is necessary for this snippet.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis code is benign, and the reports correctly reflect that.",
