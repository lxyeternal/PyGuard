  "purpose": "This code defines the package version as a simple string assignment, auto-generated by setup.py, serving as package metadata.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ from setup.py, with no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment with no data movement or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward, auto-generated version string with no suspicious features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string (__version__ = \"0.14.0\"), generated automatically. No inputs, outputs, data flows, or external communications are present. The code lacks obfuscation, malicious logic, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The simplicity and standard practice of such version declarations justify these assessments. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, auto-generated package metadata with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
