  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code snippet in question is a simple assignment of a version string: `__version__ = \"0.14.0\"`.\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is auto-generated, minimal, and only serves as package metadata.\n- No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is straightforward and does not contain any issues.\n   - The reports correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly interpret the purpose and nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree on zero risk, and the code is trivial, there is no justification for higher scores.\n   - The assigned scores are reasonable.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as auto-generated metadata.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n- The code is a simple, auto-generated version string assignment.\n- All reports are accurate and reasonable.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is benign, standard, and carries no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
