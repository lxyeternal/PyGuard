  "purpose": "This code defines the version string for a Python package, typically generated automatically during setup.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment '__version__ = \"0.14.0\"' is the only source reading data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an auto-generated comment indicating it is generated by setup.py; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and serves to define a version identifier for a package. It is generated automatically, which is common practice. There are no inputs, data processing, or external interactions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and typical of automatically generated package metadata. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
