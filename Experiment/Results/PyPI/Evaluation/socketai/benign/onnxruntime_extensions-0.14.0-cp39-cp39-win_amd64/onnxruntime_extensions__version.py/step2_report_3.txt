  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the claims and ensure consistency with the code.\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - All reports reference the line `__version__ = \"0.14.0\"` as the sole code element.\n   - The code is a simple variable assignment, generated automatically by setup.py.\n   - No inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions are present.\n   - The comments indicate auto-generation, which is standard practice.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues or Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code is minimal, static, and typical for package versioning.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or data exfiltration.\n   - No code patterns that could be exploited or that suggest malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (high, as the analysis is straightforward)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risks identified)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - Since the code is auto-generated, it’s unlikely to contain malicious content.\n   - No evidence suggests that the version string assignment could be exploited.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n   - The code is indeed safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Based on the evidence, I would assign the following scores:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `risk`: 0\n\n- The existing scores are already aligned with this assessment.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify this as a benign, auto-generated version string assignment with no security concerns. No further action or concern is warranted.",
