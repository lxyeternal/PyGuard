  "anomalies": "Comment indicating auto-generation; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a version string to a variable, with an accompanying comment. There are no inputs, outputs, external data handling, or executable logic. It appears to be an auto-generated snippet typical for Python package versioning. No malicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign auto-generated version assignment, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
