{
  "purpose": "The code performs model export, ONNX graph manipulation, and feature extraction for speech-to-text processing, including custom operator replacement and graph merging.",
  "sources": "Reads input audio tensor, ONNX model graph nodes, and parameters for model conversion and graph editing.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include the modified ONNX model; no untrusted data or external data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input audio tensor flows through feature extraction and custom ONNX operator, then through graph modifications and model merging, resulting in a final ONNX model ready for inference.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The custom operator 'StftNorm' is replaced with standard ONNX nodes in a controlled manner.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pipeline for exporting a PyTorch model to ONNX, replacing a custom operator with standard ONNX nodes, and merging models for speech processing. No malicious patterns, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The scores reflect a low risk environment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a minimal security risk score of 0.2 justified by the complexity of model conversion but no active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, transparent, and free of malicious activity. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
