{
  "purpose": "The code provides deprecated wrapper functions for accessing and modifying thread-local Zipkin tracing attributes and span storage, facilitating context propagation in distributed tracing.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules (`py_zipkin.storage`, `py_zipkin.util`, etc.) and internal thread-local storage via the `ThreadLocalStack` class, and logs warnings.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write or pass untrusted data to external systems or sensitive locations.",
  "flows": "The functions obtain or modify thread-local Zipkin attributes and span storage by calling methods on `ThreadLocalStack` and `get_default_tracer()`, with data flow mostly from internal thread-local storage to return values.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses deprecated functions and issues warnings to inform users. No suspicious or malicious code, such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or code injection, is present. All external interactions are limited to logging and standard method calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several wrapper functions for deprecated features related to Zipkin tracing context management, mainly interacting with thread-local storage. Each function logs a warning about deprecation and then calls methods on `get_default_tracer()` or `ThreadLocalStack()`. The logic is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden code. The usage of deprecated functions suggests maintenance of legacy code rather than malicious intent. No external data transfer or unsafe operations are observed. Overall, the code appears safe, serving as legacy wrappers with appropriate warnings.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of deprecated wrapper functions for thread-local Zipkin context management, with no signs of malicious intent. It mainly provides access to internal thread-local storage, issuing warnings for deprecated usage. There are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or security risks evident in this module.",
