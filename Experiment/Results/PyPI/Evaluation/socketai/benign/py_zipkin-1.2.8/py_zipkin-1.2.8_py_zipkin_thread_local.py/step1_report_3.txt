{
  "purpose": "The code provides deprecated utility functions for accessing and manipulating thread-local Zipkin tracing attributes and span storage in a Python distributed tracing context.",
  "sources": "The functions read from the default tracer's internal thread-local storage and import ThreadLocalStack from py_zipkin.storage.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only interacts with internal storage and logs warnings.",
  "flows": "Functions retrieve or modify thread-local Zipkin attributes and span storage via the get_default_tracer() and ThreadLocalStack().",
  "anomalies": "All functions are deprecated and emit warnings advising migration to the Tracer interface; no code injections, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code solely interacts with internal, trusted data structures. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple utility functions for accessing thread-local tracing data, all marked as deprecated and emitting warnings to inform users. These functions access internal storage via get_default_tracer() and ThreadLocalStack, which are standard internal components. No external data sources, user inputs, or untrusted data are processed. No suspicious or malicious code behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection, is present. The code's structure is straightforward and adheres to standard practices, with no obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of deprecated internal utility functions for managing tracing context, with no signs of malicious activity. It primarily warns users about deprecation and encourages migration to newer APIs. There are no security risks or malware indications in this code fragment.",
