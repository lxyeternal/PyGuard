  "purpose": "Deprecated wrapper functions providing access to internal thread-local Zipkin tracing attributes and spans for backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Internal storage attributes such as _context_stack._storage and _span_storage, accessed via get_default_tracer() and ThreadLocalStack().get()",
  "sinks": "No external data, network operations, or untrusted input; internal attribute access only",
  "flows": "Functions call internal storage accessors, returning internal data structures without external influence",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal, underscore-prefixed attributes which are fragile and internal implementation details; no obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of deprecated functions that serve as backward compatibility wrappers for internal thread-local storage related to Zipkin tracing. They emit deprecation warnings and access internal attributes like _context_stack._storage and _span_storage, which are internal and potentially fragile but not malicious. No external data processing, network communication, or code execution occurs. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The reliance on internal attributes introduces minor stability concerns but does not constitute security risks. The code's purpose is solely to support legacy systems, not to perform any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as deprecated internal accessors for Zipkin tracing context. There is no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior present. The low security risk stems from reliance on internal attributes, which could cause stability issues if internal implementations change, but do not pose security threats.",
