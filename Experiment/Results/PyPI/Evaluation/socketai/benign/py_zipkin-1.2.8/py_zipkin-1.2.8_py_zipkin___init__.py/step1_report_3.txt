  "purpose": "The code exports specific functions and types from private modules within the py_zipkin package, likely to be used elsewhere in the project for tracing and encoding purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'py_zipkin.encoding._types' and 'py_zipkin.storage' modules, which are internal to the package.",
  "sinks": "No data is processed or sent to external systems; the code only imports symbols.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only imports and re-exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed. All imports are from internal modules and are used to expose certain classes and functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from internal modules of the py_zipkin package, likely to provide an API or facilitate tracing functions. There is no evidence of data handling, user input, or malicious actions. The imports appear standard for a package designed for distributed tracing.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs straightforward imports from internal modules for use elsewhere. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be part of a module or package setup for exposing certain functionalities.",
