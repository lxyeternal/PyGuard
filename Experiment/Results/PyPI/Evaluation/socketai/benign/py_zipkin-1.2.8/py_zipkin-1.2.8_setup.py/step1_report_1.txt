{
  "purpose": "The script defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'py_zipkin', including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'CHANGELOG.rst' files for long description; importing standard modules; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input; setup configuration is static.",
  "flows": "Reading files for long description during setup; no flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior; no hardcoded credentials or secret data; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup process for a Python package, reading static files and defining dependencies and metadata. The 'read' function simply opens and reads files relative to the script location. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation based on external input. The script does not contain any obfuscated or malicious code segments. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for package installation purposes.",
