  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the py_zipkin library for distribution on PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md and CHANGELOG.rst files; importing modules; defining version string.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior or leaks.",
  "flows": "Read files during setup to include long descriptions; no flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Read function opens files without context management, but this is standard in setup scripts; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily uses standard setup() functions from setuptools to package the library. The read() function reads content from files for long descriptions, which is typical. No untrusted input, code injection, or malicious behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or other suspicious activities are present. The code follows normal packaging patterns without obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is intended solely for packaging purposes.",
