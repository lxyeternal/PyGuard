  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of a Zipkin HTTP transport. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident. The network activity involves sending data to user-specified endpoints, which is expected for such a component. The risk scores are justified and accurate."
