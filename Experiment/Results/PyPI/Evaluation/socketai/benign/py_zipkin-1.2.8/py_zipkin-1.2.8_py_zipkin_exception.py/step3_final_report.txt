  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for Zipkin-related errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code is a class definition with a docstring.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the class is a simple exception subclass with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal class inheriting from Exception, serving as a custom error type. It contains no input/output, embedded code, or dynamic behavior. The class is a standard pattern in Python for custom exceptions. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. The confidence score of 1 is justified given the simplicity and clarity. Overall, the code poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with its content. No modifications are necessary.",
