  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling Zipkin-related errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as there are no input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "Simple class definition with no unusual or suspicious constructs; nothing out of the ordinary.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, intended for specialized error handling related to Zipkin. It contains only a docstring and class declaration without any functional code, data processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It appears to be a standard pattern for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and intended solely for custom error management. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
