  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling Zipkin-related errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the class is a simple exception subclass definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only defines an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class 'ZipkinError' inheriting from 'Exception', with a docstring explaining its purpose. It does not include any code that reads input, writes output, or performs computations. No external data handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The class is purely for error handling within a larger system, and there is no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign class definition for a custom exception with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
