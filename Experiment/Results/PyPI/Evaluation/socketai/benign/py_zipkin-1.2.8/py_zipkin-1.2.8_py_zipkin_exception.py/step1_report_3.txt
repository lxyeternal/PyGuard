  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling Zipkin-related errors.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths as the code only defines an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception with a docstring. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or security-sensitive actions. There are no embedded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns. The class is straightforward and intended for error handling related to Zipkin, a tracing system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign custom exception class with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
