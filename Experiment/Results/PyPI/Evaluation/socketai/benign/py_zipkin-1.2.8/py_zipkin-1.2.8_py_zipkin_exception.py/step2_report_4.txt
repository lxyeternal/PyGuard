  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code verification**: The code in all reports is a minimal class definition inheriting from `Exception` with a docstring. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, no embedded code, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The code is syntactically correct and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes**: No errors or flaws are evident. The class is simple and serves a clear purpose.\n\n3. **Scores review**:\n   - **Obfuscated score (0)**: Correct, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - **Malware score (0)**: Correct, no malicious activity or code.\n   - **Security risk score (0)**: Correct, no vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores**:\n   - Since the code is purely a class definition for error handling, with no external interactions or complex logic, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The malware score is 0 because there's no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0 because the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The security risk score is 0 because it doesn't introduce any vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent are present.\n\n6. **Score consistency**:\n   - All reports assign scores of 1 for confidence and 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Summary of my assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Final note**: The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
