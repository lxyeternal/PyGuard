    "no data sinks or output functions that transmit data externally."

  "flows": [
    "generate_random_64bit_string() and generate_random_128bit_string() produce IDs from random bits and current time.",
    "create_attrs_for_span() calls these functions based on parameters to generate trace IDs and span IDs.",
    "sampling decision made via _should_sample() based on random number and sample rate."
  ],
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. Functions use standard library functions in typical ways. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utilities for trace ID generation, conversion between hex and signed integers, and sampling decisions for distributed tracing. Randomness is generated via Python's random module, and timestamp inclusion in 128-bit IDs aligns with common tracing practices. No external network communication, file manipulation, or data exfiltration routines are present. The functions appear to serve legitimate purposes within a tracing system without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of tracing utilities with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses standard techniques for ID generation, conversion, and sampling. No malicious or maliciously intended code is detected.",
