  "purpose": "To provide a main interface for interacting with the kinesis-video-media service through a client class.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing KinesisVideoMediaClient from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external communications present.",
  "flows": "The code only imports and exposes a client class; there are no data flows or input/output handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for a service interface.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a simple interface wrapper, importing a client class and defining an alias. It includes a docstring with documentation link, copyright info, and example usage. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external calls that could be malicious are present. It does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module defining a client interface for the kinesis-video-media service. No signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected.",
