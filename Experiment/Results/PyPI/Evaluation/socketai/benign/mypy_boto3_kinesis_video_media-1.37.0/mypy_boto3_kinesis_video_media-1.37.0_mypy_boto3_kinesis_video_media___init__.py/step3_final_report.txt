  "purpose": "Provides an interface to the Kinesis Video Media client for AWS SDK usage.",
  "sources": "Imports the KinesisVideoMediaClient class from a local module (.client).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "Import of client class -> assignment to Client -> exposure via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year 2025.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal wrapper module that imports a client class and exposes it. It contains no runtime data processing, external inputs, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The documentation and structure are typical for SDK modules. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. The future date in the copyright is not suspicious. Overall, the code poses no security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward SDK interface module with no malicious intent, security vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
