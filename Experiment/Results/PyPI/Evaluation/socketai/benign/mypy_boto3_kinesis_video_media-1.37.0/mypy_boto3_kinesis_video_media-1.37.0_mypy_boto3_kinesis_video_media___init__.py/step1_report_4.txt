  "purpose": "Provides an interface to interact with the kinesis-video-media service, including documentation and client setup.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing KinesisVideoMediaClient from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code primarily imports and assigns references.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only standard module import/export patterns; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a client class, assigns it to a variable, and exposes it via __all__. It includes documentation and usage examples. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or suspicious behaviors are present. No signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module for interfacing with the kinesis-video-media service. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks detected.",
