  "sources": "Import statement importing KinesisVideoMediaClient from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform unsafe actions.",
  "flows": "User imports the client class, which can then be used to interact with the service.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual patterns are present. The code appears to be standard module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a client class, defines a Client alias, and specifies export variables. The comments and documentation are benign. No external data sources, user inputs, or data flows are present. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues. The structure aligns with typical SDK or library entry points.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a service client, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
