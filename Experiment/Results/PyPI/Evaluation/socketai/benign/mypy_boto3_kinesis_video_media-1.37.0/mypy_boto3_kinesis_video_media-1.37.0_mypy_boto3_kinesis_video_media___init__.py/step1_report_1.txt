  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the kinesis-video-media service by importing and aliasing the client class for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports the KinesisVideoMediaClient class from a local module (.client).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not process or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code imports a class and exposes it via an alias and __all__, with no data flow from external sources into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily serves as a module interface, importing a client class and defining exports. It contains a docstring with usage instructions and documentation link, but no runtime logic or data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a straightforward module interface for the kinesis-video-media service client. There are no indications of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks in this snippet.",
