  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a set of type annotations and data structure definitions for the boto3 kinesis-video-media service.\n- It uses conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- It defines TypedDict classes representing request and response data structures.\n- There are no functions, dynamic code, network operations, or data processing.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The code appears to be a benign utility module for static type checking.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for boto3 stubs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No anomalies, no suspicious code, no malware. The report correctly identifies the code as a straightforward type definition module.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **reasonable.**\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type hints.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent, no suspicious behavior. The code is safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **appropriate.**\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, defining data structures.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, just type definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **justified.**\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, for type checking.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **appropriate.**\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, for type annotations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence of malware or obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk level:** The code is purely for static type annotations, with no runtime or external data handling.\n- **Scores assigned by reports:** All are zero for malware and obfuscated, and zero for risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risk; purely static type definitions.\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign, serving as type annotations for static analysis.\n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a safe, standard set of type definitions for boto3's kinesis-video-media service. The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all remain at **0**.",
