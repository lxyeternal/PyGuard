{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the kinesis-video-media service in boto3, used for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, botocore.response, and internal literals; data is received via type annotations, not external input.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data processing or external output involved.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code solely defines types and constants without processing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code strictly defines data structures and includes documentation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type definitions, conditional imports for compatibility, and documentation. It imports modules, defines typed dictionaries for AWS response structures, and handles Python version compatibility. No data is processed or transmitted; no dynamic code execution or external interactions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard type annotation definitions for boto3 SDK, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It functions as documentation and type hints for developers, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
