  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is purely a set of static type annotations and data structure definitions for the boto3 kinesis-video-media service.\n- It employs conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No functions, runtime logic, data processing, or external input handling are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code does not process untrusted data or perform any network operations.\n- The malware score is consistently zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and aligns with standard practices for defining TypedDicts and type aliases.\n- **Security implications:** Since the code only defines types, there are no security risks, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None are evident; the code does not handle external data or perform any logic that could be exploited.\n- **Malware potential:** Zero, as no malicious activity is suggested or possible given the static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of each report:\n\n**Report 1-5 Summary:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward type annotations for boto3 SDK stubs.\n- They consistently note the absence of untrusted data handling, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n- The confidence level is 1, which is appropriate given the clear, benign nature.\n- The \"malware\" score is 0 in all cases, which is correct.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score is 0, matching the analysis.\n\n**Any issues with the scores?**  \nNo. The scores are consistent and reasonable for this kind of code.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code, a score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified. All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** Also correctly assigned as 0, since there's no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the analysis, I concur with all the reports' conclusions and scores.** The code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations with no security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe set of type definitions for boto3 SDK, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified.",
