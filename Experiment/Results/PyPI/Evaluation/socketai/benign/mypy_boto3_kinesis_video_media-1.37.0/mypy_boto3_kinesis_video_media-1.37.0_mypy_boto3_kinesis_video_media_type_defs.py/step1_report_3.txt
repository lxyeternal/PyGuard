  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the kinesis-video-media service in boto3 stubs",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, botocore.response, and internal literals",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform dangerous operations",
  "flows": "Data structures are defined for input/output types; no flow of untrusted data leading to execution or leak",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns; use of type annotations is standard",
  "analysis": "The code provides type definitions for the AWS boto3 kinesis-video-media service. It imports standard libraries and boto3 components, defines data classes using TypedDict, and manages compatibility with different Python versions. There are no functions executing untrusted input, no network operations, or other side effects. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage are present. The code appears to be a benign type stub for static type checking purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type definitions for AWS service responses and requests, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a legitimate part of type stubs for static analysis, with no security concerns.",
