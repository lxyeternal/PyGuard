  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a set of type annotations and data structure definitions for the boto3 kinesis-video-media service.\n- It uses conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No functions, runtime data processing, or external data handling are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The code appears to be a benign, static type stub for aiding static analysis and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is purely for type annotations and documentation, with no runtime logic or data processing. This matches the code content.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and standard for type stubs.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n1. **Malware & Obfuscation:**\n   - The code contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data handling.\n   - The only complexity is conditional imports, which are standard practice.\n\n2. **Security Risks:**\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or external data processing.\n   - The code is purely for static type checking.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities:**\n   - Since the code is static type definitions, the likelihood of vulnerabilities is negligible.\n   - No assumptions about runtime behavior are necessary; the code does not process untrusted input.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code)\n   - **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n   - **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign and serves as a static type stub.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My Personal Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and free of security concerns. It is a standard type definition module for boto3 SDK, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
