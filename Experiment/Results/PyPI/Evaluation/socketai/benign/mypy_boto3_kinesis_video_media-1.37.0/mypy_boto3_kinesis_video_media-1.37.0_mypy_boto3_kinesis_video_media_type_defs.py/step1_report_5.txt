  "purpose": "Type annotations for kinesis-video-media service type definitions for boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, botocore.response, and local literals; class definitions; type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not process untrusted input or output data directly.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only defines data structures without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type definitions for AWS SDK response structures and input parameters using Python's TypedDict and type annotations. It imports necessary modules and conditionally imports types based on Python version, which is standard practice for compatibility. There are no external data sources, user input handling, or data processing that could introduce security risks. The code strictly defines data types for documentation and static analysis purposes, with no active execution or data manipulation involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of type definitions for AWS boto3 stubs related to kinesis-video-media. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and purely serves as type hints for developers.",
