  "purpose": "Type annotations for kinesis-video-media service type definitions, providing structured data types for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Code reads no external input; defines data structures and type aliases using TypedDict and Union.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; static type definitions do not process runtime data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow at runtime, only static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; conditional imports are standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions for boto3's kinesis-video-media service, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It contains no functions, runtime logic, network operations, or data processing. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The malware score is 0, security risk is 0, obfuscation is 0, and confidence is high (1). The code's purpose is purely for static analysis and documentation, posing no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for boto3's kinesis-video-media service. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
