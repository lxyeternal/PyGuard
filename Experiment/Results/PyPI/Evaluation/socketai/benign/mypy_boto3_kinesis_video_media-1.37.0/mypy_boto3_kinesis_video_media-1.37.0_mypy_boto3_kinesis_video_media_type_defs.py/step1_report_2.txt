  "purpose": "Type annotations and definitions for the kinesis-video-media service in boto3, providing type hints for better code clarity and validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, and botocore.response, as well as local literals.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; the code primarily defines data structures and type hints.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process or handle untrusted data at runtime but defines types for such data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscated code present. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type hints and TypedDict classes for boto3 kinesis-video-media service. It uses conditional imports based on Python version for typing compatibility. No external input handling, network activity, or data processing occurs. The code is purely for type annotations and documentation purposes, with no dynamic code execution or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe set of type definitions and documentation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The use of version-dependent imports and type annotations is typical for maintaining compatibility across Python versions.",
