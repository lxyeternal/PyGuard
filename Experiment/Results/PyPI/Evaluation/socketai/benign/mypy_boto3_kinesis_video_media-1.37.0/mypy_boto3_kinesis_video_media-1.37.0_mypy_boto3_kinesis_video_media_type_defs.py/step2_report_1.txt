  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a set of type annotations and data structure definitions for boto3's kinesis-video-media service.\n- The code relies on conditional imports for Python version compatibility, defines TypedDict classes, and includes documentation.\n- No functions, runtime logic, data processing, or network operations are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The malware score is consistently zero across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validity of Reports:\n\n**Are the reported issues present?**  \nYes. The reports correctly identify that the code is purely for type annotations and documentation, with no runtime or security risks.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning?**  \nNo. The reasoning in all reports is sound, noting the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Scores assigned:**  \n- `malware`: 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- `securityRisk`: 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- `obfuscated`: 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- `confidence`: 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes. The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of the Reports:\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying that this is a benign set of type definitions.\n- No report claims or implies any malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The use of version-dependent imports and type annotations is standard practice for compatibility and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or malicious behavior?**  \nNo. The code only defines data structures; it does not process untrusted data or execute any logic that could be exploited.\n\n- **Could the code be malicious or obfuscated?**  \nNo. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs.\n\n- **Is there any reason to increase the malware or risk scores?**  \nNo. Given the content, scores should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n| Metric          | Score | Justification                                                      |\n|-----------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware         | 0      | No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.     |\n| obfuscated      | 0      | Clear, straightforward type definitions with no obfuscation.       |\n| securityRisk    | 0      | No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions.       |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for boto3's kinesis-video-media service. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that the code remains unchanged and is obtained from trusted sources. Given the current analysis, there are no security concerns with this code snippet.",
