  "purpose": "Type annotations for kinesis-video-media service type definitions for boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.version_info checks, and the definition of TypedDict classes and type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No explicit untrusted data sinks; the code primarily defines type annotations and data structures.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process runtime data flows or handle untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type annotations for boto3 kinesis-video-media service responses, using conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility. It imports standard libraries and third-party types (typing_extensions), defines TypedDict classes representing response and request structures, and includes documentation comments. There are no functions executing logic, data processing, or network operations. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type definitions for boto3 SDK stubs, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility module intended to aid static type checking.",
