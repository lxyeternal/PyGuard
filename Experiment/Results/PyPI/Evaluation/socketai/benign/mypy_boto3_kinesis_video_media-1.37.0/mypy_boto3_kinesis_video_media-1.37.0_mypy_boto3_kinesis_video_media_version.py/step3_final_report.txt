{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a static source of truth for the package version, defining __version__ as '1.37.0'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it contains only a comment, a copyright notice, and a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the future copyright year '2025', which is likely a typo but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string with no dynamic code, external dependencies, or obfuscated elements. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The only unusual aspect is the future year in the comment, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores as zero. The code's simplicity and clarity support these conclusions. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. The minor typo in the copyright year does not affect security assessment.",
