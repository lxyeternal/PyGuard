  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is just a static assignment to `__version__`.\n- No untrusted data sinks, no data flow, no anomalies.\n- Conclusion: benign, standard version declaration.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Notes the future copyright year (2025) as suspicious or a typo.\n- No malicious code or data flow.\n- Conclusion: no security risk, just an unusual comment.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the straightforward static assignment.\n- No anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: benign version declaration.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to others, no anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- No external data or dynamic code.\n- Conclusion: safe, standard version info.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern: static assignment, no anomalies.\n- No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — suitable.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is just a static version string assignment.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0 in all cases; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk score:** Properly 0; no vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The only minor point is the future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n- No report suggests any dynamic or external data handling, which is consistent with the code.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes needed.\n- The code is a typical, benign version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with all reports and the code content.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a simple, static version declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
