  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module",
  "sources": "Assignment to __version__ variable",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "None, as the code only assigns a static string to a variable",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only a version string with a comment, no suspicious code or logic",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment, a copyright statement, and a variable assignment setting __version__ to '1.37.0'. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity is evident. The structure is typical for a version declaration in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It serves as a package metadata indicator and contains no security concerns.",
