  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their conclusions, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code, or data flows are present.\n- The code is minimal, typical for Python package version declarations.\n- The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or oversight but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and evaluations:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code is straightforward: a comment, a copyright notice, and a static assignment.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**\n- The only potential flaw is the mention of the future year (2025). While this might be a typo, it does not impact security.\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or very close to 0.\n- These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- The only \"anomaly\" is the future copyright year, but it does not constitute a security risk.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- No malicious activity is indicated or implied.\n- The code does not perform any network calls, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n- Malware score should remain at 0.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected or implied.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is plain, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** **0** — the code is a simple version declaration with no security implications.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The only minor anomaly is the future year (2025), which is likely a typo. It does not elevate the security risk.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Score | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0            | No malicious activity or indicators present.               |\n| Obfuscated        | 0            | Code is straightforward and human-readable.                |\n| Security Risk     | 0            | No vulnerabilities, no dynamic or unsafe code.             |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores and note the minor typo in the copyright year as a non-security concern.",
