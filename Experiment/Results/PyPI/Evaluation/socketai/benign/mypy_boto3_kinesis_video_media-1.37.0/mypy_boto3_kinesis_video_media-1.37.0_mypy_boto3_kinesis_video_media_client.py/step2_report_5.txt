  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, assessing the scores, and ensuring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward type annotations and class definitions for the Kinesis Video Media client, with no external or untrusted input sources, no data leaks, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic execution, network calls, or data processing from untrusted sources. It is purely a static SDK interface.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Security Risk = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Confidence = 1.0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code content. The code is standard SDK wrapper code with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code provides type annotations and client class for AWS Kinesis Video Media, with no suspicious logic or external data handling.\n- **Findings:** No external data processing, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Security Risk = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code is standard SDK interface code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard interface with no malicious behavior. It mentions the code is for type annotations, with no suspicious constructs.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic execution, no external data processing, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Security Risk = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is justified. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Slightly more cautious, noting that generate_presigned_url and get_media could be misused if inputs are malicious, but no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Findings:** These functions are standard in SDKs; potential misuse is inherent but not specific to this code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Security Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The security risk score of 0.2 reflects a minimal concern about potential misuse, which is reasonable given that URL presigning can be exploited if inputs are malicious. However, the code itself is not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the code's standard nature and lack of malicious intent.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code or obfuscated constructs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Security Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.0, Confidence = 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score is justified, considering the functions could be misused but are standard SDK features.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. I agree with the malware score of 0.0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports correctly assign 0.0.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Most reports assign very low scores (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk due to functions like URL presigning. This is appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is standard SDK interface code with no malicious intent.\n- The only point of contention is the security risk score in report 4 (0.2). Given that URL presigning can be exploited if inputs are malicious, this is reasonable, but the code itself does not facilitate such misuse directly.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious code present)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (minimal inherent risk due to URL presigning, but no actual vulnerabilities in the code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation. The slight security risk is inherent to the nature of URL presigning functions but does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are accurate and consistent.
