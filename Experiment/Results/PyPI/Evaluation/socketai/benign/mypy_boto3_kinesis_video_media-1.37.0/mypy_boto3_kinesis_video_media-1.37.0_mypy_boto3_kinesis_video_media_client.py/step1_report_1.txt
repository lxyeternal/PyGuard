{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for the Kinesis Video Media client in boto3, facilitating type-safe interactions with AWS services.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type definitions, sys version info, and imports from botocore modules; no external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or could leak data are present; the code primarily defines classes and methods with annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines method signatures and class properties.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior. The code appears to be standard SDK wrapper code with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for the AWS Kinesis Video Media service with associated exceptions and properties. It uses conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility. No dynamic execution, network calls, or data processing from untrusted sources are implemented. It solely provides type annotations and class structure aligning with boto3 documentation. No suspicious code, obfuscated constructs, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface for type safety and documentation purposes. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a benign, auxiliary code module for AWS SDK type annotations.",
