{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the Kinesis Video Media service in boto3, enabling type-safe interactions with AWS Kinesis Video Streams.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; the code reads data from version info, system modules, and imported dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions appear to process or output untrusted data directly; generate_presigned_url returns a URL string, but this is standard for AWS SDKs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., operation names, params, kwargs) are passed to boto3 client methods; the get_media method unpacks kwargs into API call parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is purely interface and type definition for AWS SDK usage.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class and method definitions that facilitate interaction with AWS Kinesis Video Streams. It includes type annotations, property accessors, and method signatures with documented links. No dynamic execution, input/output processing, or suspicious logic is present. The use of standard library modules and botocore is consistent with normal SDK client implementations. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured interface definition for the Kinesis Video Media client in boto3, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It serves as a type-safe wrapper for AWS SDK calls, with no suspicious behavior.",
