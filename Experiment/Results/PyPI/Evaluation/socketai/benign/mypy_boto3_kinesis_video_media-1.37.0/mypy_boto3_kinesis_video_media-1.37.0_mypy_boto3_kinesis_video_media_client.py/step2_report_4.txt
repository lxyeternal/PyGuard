  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a type annotations and class definitions for the Kinesis Video Media client, with no external or untrusted input sources, no data leaks, and no anomalies.\n- **Findings:** The report correctly identifies that this is a standard SDK wrapper with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Fully benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes that the code is a straightforward type annotation for AWS SDK client, with no suspicious logic.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code, no external data processing, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the code providing type annotations, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no external data handling, just interface definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes that generate_presigned_url and get_media could be misused if inputs are malicious, but this is inherent to SDK functions, not the code itself.\n- **Findings:** The functions are standard SDK methods; potential misuse is a risk but not indicative of malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, SecurityRisk = 0.2 — this is reasonable, considering that URL presigning can be misused if inputs are malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; standard SDK wrapper.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing standard patterns and no suspicious code.\n- **Findings:** No obfuscation, no malware, no malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 — acceptable, given the functions could be misused but are not malicious themselves.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0.0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports due to potential misuse of functions like `generate_presigned_url`, but this is inherent to the SDK's design, not a flaw or malicious intent.\n\n### Overall estimate:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is purely a type annotation and SDK interface wrapper with no malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements.\n\n**My final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect potential misuse of SDK functions, but not a security flaw)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security threat. The potential for misuse exists but is inherent to the SDK's functionality, not the code itself.",
