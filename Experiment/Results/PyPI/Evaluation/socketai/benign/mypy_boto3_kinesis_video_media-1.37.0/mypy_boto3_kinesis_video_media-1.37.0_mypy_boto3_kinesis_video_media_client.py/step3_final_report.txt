{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for the AWS Kinesis Video Media client, serving as a structured SDK interface with no runtime logic.",
  "sources": "Class properties, method signatures, and documentation links; no external input or data processing.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of generate_presigned_url and get_media functions with untrusted inputs, which could be misused but do not constitute malicious code.",
  "flows": "Method calls to generate_presigned_url and get_media with parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources within the code itself.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely structural, providing type annotations and SDK interface classes. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The functions could be misused if inputs are malicious, but this is inherent to SDK features, not the code. Scores assigned across reports are consistent and justified, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and minimal security risk scores reflecting potential misuse rather than actual vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security threat. The slight security risk scores are appropriate given the functions' nature but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
