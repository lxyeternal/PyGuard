{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the Kinesis Video Media service in boto3, including exception handling and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; properties and functions that interact with AWS SDK.",
  "sinks": "Method calls such as generate_presigned_url and get_media that could process or generate URLs and media streams; potential data flow from input parameters to AWS services.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., Params, ClientMethod, kwargs) flow into method calls that interact with AWS SDK; generate_presigned_url produces a URL string; get_media returns media content (not detailed here).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; use of standard SDK patterns; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution; no suspicious network activity or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and a wrapper class for the boto3 client, following standard patterns. It defines exception classes and method signatures aligned with AWS SDK. The generate_presigned_url and get_media functions are typical SDK methods without custom logic. No evidence of malicious behavior or unusual code segments. The code appears to be a well-structured type annotation module for AWS Kinesis Video Media, with no suspicious activities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate type annotation and client wrapper for the AWS SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured SDK interface module.",
