  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code to identify any inconsistencies, potential issues, or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SDK wrapper with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code, which is primarily type annotations and class definitions for boto3.  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — correct, no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — justified, no security concerns.  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is straightforward SDK interface code with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** The code is consistent with the description, with no signs of malicious intent.  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — correct.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — justified.  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a standard interface with no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; the code contains no obfuscation or malware.  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — correct.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — correct.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — justified.  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Slightly more cautious, noting that `generate_presigned_url` and `get_media` could be misused if inputs are malicious, but no malicious code is present.  \n- **Assessment:** This is a reasonable observation. These functions are inherently capable of being misused if inputs are malicious, but the code itself is standard and safe.  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — correct.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — perhaps slightly overcautious, but acceptable given the functions' nature.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — aligns with the cautious stance.  \n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but reasonable. No malicious code detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing that the code is standard, with no signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no obfuscation or malware is present.  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — correct.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — acceptable, given the functions involved.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — justified.  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code content:** Purely type annotations and class definitions for AWS SDK interaction.  \n- **Malware potential:** None detected.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.  \n- **Security risk:** Very low; functions are standard SDK wrappers.\n\n### Final Justification:\nAll reports are consistent with the code's nature. The only minor point is the cautious security risk scores for functions like `generate_presigned_url`, which could theoretically be misused if inputs are malicious. However, since the code is just an interface with no logic, the risk is minimal and inherent to the functionality, not the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — clear, standard code.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — no security risk beyond standard SDK use.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, well-structured, and purely serves as a type-safe interface for AWS SDK. No changes needed to the existing scores or analysis.",
