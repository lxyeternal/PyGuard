{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class for interacting with AWS Kinesis Video Media service using boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and relative import of type definitions; class methods and properties that define API interactions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network or data leaks are apparent; no code injection points; no use of environment variables or sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Method definitions with parameters that interact with AWS API endpoints; no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; code appears to be straightforward type annotations and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for AWS SDK client, including exception classes, method signatures, and property definitions. It imports standard modules and conditional imports based on Python version, all consistent with library code. No external data is read at runtime; no suspicious logic or external connections are embedded. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. The code seems to serve as a type-annotated interface for the boto3 client, with no malicious or security-compromising behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, type-annotated client wrapper for AWS Kinesis Video Media, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily provides type hints and structured exception handling, with no evidence of malware or security threats.",
