{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entrypoint for a package, providing version and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments via sys.argv, writing output to stdout via sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Writing data to stdout, which is generally safe and not a security sink.",
  "flows": "Input (sys.argv) is checked for '--version' and if present, triggers print_version(), otherwise triggers print_info(). No other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code simply outputs static information.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys for command-line argument parsing and output. It defines functions to print static package info and version info. The main() function checks for a '--version' argument and calls the appropriate print function. The script executes main() if run as main. The logic is straightforward and only outputs static strings, with no data processing, network access, or untrusted data handling. No anomalies, malicious patterns, or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility that outputs package information. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It performs simple, static outputs based on command-line arguments.",
