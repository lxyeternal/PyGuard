  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version info.\n- It checks for the \"--version\" argument to decide which info to print.\n- It uses standard library functions (`sys.argv`, `sys.stdout.write`) and outputs static strings.\n- No dynamic code execution, no external data sources, no network activity.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code appears benign, straightforward, and purpose-specific.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code\n- The reports correctly identify that the code only outputs static information.\n- No issues such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign and functions as intended for a CLI info utility.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Review and critique the report logic and scores\n\n**Analysis of each report:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** All reports accurately describe the purpose and flow of the script.\n- **Sources & sinks:** Correctly identified as `sys.argv` and `sys.stdout`.\n- **Anomalies:** All reports note the absence of anomalies, secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Consistent, noting that the script is straightforward, static, and benign.\n- **Confidence:** All reports assign a confidence of 1.0, which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0.0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0.0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- No report suggests any reason to increase the malware or risk scores.\n- The reasoning is consistent across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Justify risk and malware scores\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- No obfuscation, dynamic code, or external data handling.\n- The static output and straightforward logic pose no security threat.\n\n**Therefore:**\n- Malware score should remain **0.0**.\n- Obfuscated score should remain **0.0**.\n- Security risk score should remain **0.0**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final assessment\nBased on the review, the code is a benign CLI utility with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and should not be increased.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, with no security concerns. The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future modifications, but based on the current static code, there is no security risk.",
