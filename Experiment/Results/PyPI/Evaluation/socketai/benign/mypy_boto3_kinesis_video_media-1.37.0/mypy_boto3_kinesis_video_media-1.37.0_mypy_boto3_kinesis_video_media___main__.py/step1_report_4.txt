  "purpose": "CLI entrypoint script for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and outputs data to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "targets": "Outputs information about package details and version to stdout.",
  "flows": "If '--version' argument is provided, calls print_version() and outputs version; otherwise calls print_info() and outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. No network activity or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles CLI argument parsing and outputs static information about the package. It uses standard libraries (sys) with no user input processing beyond command-line args. No external data sources, no environment variable usage, no file I/O beyond printing. No suspicious behavior, no data leaks, and no malicious code detected. The structure is straightforward and adheres to typical CLI script patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign CLI utility designed to display package information and version. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
