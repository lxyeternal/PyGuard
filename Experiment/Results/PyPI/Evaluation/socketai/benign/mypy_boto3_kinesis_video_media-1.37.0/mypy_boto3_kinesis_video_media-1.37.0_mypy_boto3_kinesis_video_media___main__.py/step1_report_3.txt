  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint that outputs package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout.write for outputting info.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs to stdout; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check flows to version print; otherwise, info print to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a CLI interface that outputs static package info and version. It only reads command-line arguments and writes static strings to stdout. No untrusted data inputs or external network interactions are present. No suspicious or malicious logic is detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical CLI patterns. No obfuscation or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple CLI tool for displaying package info and version, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
