  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- A minimal CLI script that outputs static package info or version.\n- Checks for '--version' argument; if present, prints version; otherwise, prints package info.\n- Uses only standard library functions (sys.stdout.write, sys.argv).\n- No dynamic code, no network activity, no data manipulation, no obfuscation.\n- No signs of malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, static, and contains no vulnerabilities or malicious elements.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent with the code. They correctly identify the script as benign, simple, and static.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All reports assign 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Each Report:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurately describe the script's function.\n- **Sources & sinks:** Correctly identify sys.argv and sys.stdout.\n- **Anomalies:** Correctly note the absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Consistently describe the code as benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n**No issues with the reports' reasoning or scoring.**\n\n---\n\n### Additional observations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports is correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate, given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying static package info and version.\n- No vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or obfuscation present.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the script as safe, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
