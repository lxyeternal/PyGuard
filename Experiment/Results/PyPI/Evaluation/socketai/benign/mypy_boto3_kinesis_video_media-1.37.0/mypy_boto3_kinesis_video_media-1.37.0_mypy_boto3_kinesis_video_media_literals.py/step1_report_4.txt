  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS service and region identifiers used in boto3 stubs for type checking.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and typing, and the definitions of string literal variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs present in the code.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only declares constants and types without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code consists solely of type alias declarations and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines a series of string literal types for AWS services, regions, and resources. The docstring provides usage examples and links to documentation. The content is static, purely for type annotations, with no runtime logic or data handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. No obfuscation or suspicious language features are used.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module for defining type annotations for AWS service names and regions. It serves as part of a type-stub package and contains no malicious or security-related concerns.",
