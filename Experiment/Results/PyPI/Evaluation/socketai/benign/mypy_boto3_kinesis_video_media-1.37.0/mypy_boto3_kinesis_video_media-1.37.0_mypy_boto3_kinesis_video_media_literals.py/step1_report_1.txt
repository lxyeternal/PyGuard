  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various AWS service literals, including service names, regions, and specific identifier types.",
  "sources": "Type annotation definitions, imported modules (sys, typing), and the module's global constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that process untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely defines constants and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. Usage of version-dependent imports is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type annotations for various AWS service identifiers, with conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version. No data processing, user input handling, or external data fetching occurs. All constants are static string literals used for type hinting. No obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious logic is found. The purpose appears to be for static type checking support in a Python project involving AWS services.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module defining string literal types for AWS services and regions, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It is purely for type hinting purposes, enhancing code correctness and IDE support.",
