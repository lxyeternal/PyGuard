  "purpose": "To define type annotations for AWS service literal strings used in boto3 stubs for type safety.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and typing; assignment of string literals for type aliases.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing or external outputs observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The code primarily defines constants and type aliases.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice. It defines various string literal types for AWS services, regions, and resource types. The purpose appears to be for type hinting in boto3 stubs, with no external data input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and intended solely for type annotation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining type annotations with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or sensitive operations.",
