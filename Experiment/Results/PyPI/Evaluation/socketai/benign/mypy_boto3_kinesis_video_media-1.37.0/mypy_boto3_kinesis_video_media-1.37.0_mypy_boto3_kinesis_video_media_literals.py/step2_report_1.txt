  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Vulnerabilities:**  \n   All reports consistently state that the code is solely defining static string literals and type annotations for AWS services, regions, and related identifiers. There are no signs of data processing, user input handling, external data fetching, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n\n2. **Code Functionality and Logic:**  \n   The code is a straightforward static type definitions module, designed to support static type checking with mypy or similar tools. It uses conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions, which is standard practice.\n\n3. **Potential Security Risks:**  \n   Since the code only defines constants and type aliases, there is no attack surface for injection, code execution, or data leakage. The absence of any runtime logic, external dependencies (beyond type hints), or network interactions further minimizes risk.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity or code is present.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — The code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.  \n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk or vulnerabilities are introduced by this static definitions module.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns:**  \n   The reports seem accurate and comprehensive. They correctly identify that the code is benign and solely for type safety purposes.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS SDK literals, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It serves as a static type support utility, and its scores should reflect that.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores of zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk. No further action needed.",
