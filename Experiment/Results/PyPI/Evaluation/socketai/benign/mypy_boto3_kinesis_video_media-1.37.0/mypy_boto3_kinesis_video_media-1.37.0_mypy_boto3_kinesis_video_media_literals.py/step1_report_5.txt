{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS service names, region names, and other constants to ensure type safety in code that interacts with AWS SDKs.",
  "sources": "Importing sys module, reading Python version info.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; no data processing or external data output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code mainly defines constants and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. Use of conditional import for typing extensions based on Python version is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for AWS-related string literals, ensuring correct usage in client code. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version. All definitions are static, hardcoded string literals serving as type constraints. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications. It strictly defines constants for type safety.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is purely for type hinting and constant definitions related to AWS services and regions. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no obfuscated or harmful code. It is safe and intended to improve code correctness.",
