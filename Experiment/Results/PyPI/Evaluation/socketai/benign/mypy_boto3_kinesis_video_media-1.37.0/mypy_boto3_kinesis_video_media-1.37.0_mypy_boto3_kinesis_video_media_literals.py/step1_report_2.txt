{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS service literals, including service names, regions, and specific string literals for API usage.",
  "sources": "Constant string literals assigned to variables such as StartSelectorTypeType, KinesisVideoMediaServiceName, ServiceName, ResourceServiceName, RegionName.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external output functions; code primarily defines constants and type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only declares constants and types.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of extensive literal string definitions and conditional import for typing.Literal, which is standard for type annotations; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for AWS SDK service identifiers and related literals. It includes conditional import for compatibility across Python versions, which is common and benign. There are no user inputs, data processing, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. The large list of literals appears to be comprehensive AWS service and region names, serving as type safety aids. The code does not perform any operations beyond definitions. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or security issues are detectable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type annotations module defining AWS service and region literals for static type checking. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a safe utility module purely for type safety and documentation purposes.",
