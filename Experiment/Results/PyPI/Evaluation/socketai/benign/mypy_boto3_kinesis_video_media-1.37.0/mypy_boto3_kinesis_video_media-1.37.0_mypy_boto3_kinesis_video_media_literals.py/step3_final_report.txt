  "purpose": "Static type annotations for AWS service names, regions, resource types, and identifiers to support type checking and IDE features.",
  "sources": "Definition of string literals and type aliases, including conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains only static definitions with no data input/output or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static string literal types for AWS services, regions, and related identifiers, using conditional imports for compatibility. It contains no runtime logic, external data handling, secrets, or obfuscated code. All signals indicate benign static definitions intended for type safety and documentation support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility module for AWS SDK type annotations, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves purely as a type hinting aid, and scores should reflect its safe nature.",
