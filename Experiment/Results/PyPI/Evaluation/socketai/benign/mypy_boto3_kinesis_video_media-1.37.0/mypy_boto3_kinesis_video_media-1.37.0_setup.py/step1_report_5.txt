  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-kinesis-video-media package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; reading static package data; no external or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; no network or system modifications beyond standard package setup.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the script only reads static files and defines package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of standard setup procedures with static data. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and setuptools for package setup. It reads a markdown file for long description, and defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. All data appears static and intended for package configuration. No dynamic code execution, no user input handling, and no external network activity. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The code adheres to typical Python package setup conventions without suspicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or security-risk elements. It is a typical package configuration script for distributing a Python library.",
