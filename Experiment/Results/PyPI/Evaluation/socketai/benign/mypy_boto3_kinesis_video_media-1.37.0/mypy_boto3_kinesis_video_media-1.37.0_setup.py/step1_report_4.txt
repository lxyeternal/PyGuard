  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-kinesis-video-media package, used for package installation and metadata definition.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data leaks or external data effects identified.",
  "flows": "Reads static file content and passes it to setup; no external data flow or untrusted inputs are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code activities detected. All code is standard for a Python setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and reads a local README file for long description. It then calls setuptools.setup with package metadata and dependencies. No user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution observed. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely performs static configuration tasks.",
