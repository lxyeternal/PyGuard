  "purpose": "Setup script for publishing the mypy-boto3-kinesis-video-media package.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'README.md' for long description; imports from 'setuptools'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or sensitive data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and defines package metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily loads a README file and calls setup() with static metadata. All data sources are from local, controlled files. No dynamic code execution, user input, or network activity observed. Usage of 'setuptools' and 'Path' is standard for packaging. No embedded or obfuscated code; no suspicious variable usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It performs straightforward package configuration without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
