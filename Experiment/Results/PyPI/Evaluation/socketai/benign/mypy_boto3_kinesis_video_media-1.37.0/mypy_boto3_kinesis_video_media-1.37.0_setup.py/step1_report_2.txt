  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-kinesis-video-media package, used to configure and install the Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; reading input data from environment or external sources is not explicitly present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no network or system modifications are performed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identified; code is primarily configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs detected. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with static package configuration data. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. There are no data inputs from external sources, no execution of untrusted code, and no malicious payloads or behaviors. The code is straightforward and consistent with standard setup scripts. No anomalies or suspicious activities are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and configuration.",
