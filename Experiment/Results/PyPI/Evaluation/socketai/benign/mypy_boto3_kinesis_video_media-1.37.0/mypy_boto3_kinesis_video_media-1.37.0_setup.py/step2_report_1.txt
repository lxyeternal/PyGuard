  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the security aspects.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a standard setup.py script for a Python package.\n- It reads a local README.md file for the long description.\n- It imports from setuptools and uses Path to access local files.\n- There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, user inputs, or external data sources.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- All reports uniformly conclude that the script is benign and standard.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0.\n- The code does not contain any code that could be malicious or obfuscated.\n- The package data and dependencies are static and typical for a setup script.\n- No signs of supply chain attack vectors, such as malicious payloads, backdoors, or hidden code.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is straightforward, not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate; no security risks identified.\n\n**Potential points of concern (if any):**\n- The only dynamic operation is reading a local file (`README.md`), which is safe.\n- The dependency specification `typing-extensions; python_version<\"3.12\"` is standard.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical, benign package setup script.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent, supply chain compromise, or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with all reports and the actual code content.\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future updates or code changes, but based on the current state, this package setup script is secure and benign.",
