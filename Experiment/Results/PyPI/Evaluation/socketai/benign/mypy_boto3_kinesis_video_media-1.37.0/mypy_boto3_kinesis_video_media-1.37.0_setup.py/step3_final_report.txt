{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a library, performing static configuration without dynamic or external data sources.",
  "sources": "Reading the local README.md file for long description, static package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; all operations are static and configuration-based without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; the script is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads a local file and calls setup() with static parameters. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these scores, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup script is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code content and analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
