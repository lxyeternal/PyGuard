  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-kinesis-video-media package to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads environment variables or command line inputs indirectly via setup tools (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct data leakage or external untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flows; primarily static configuration for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Uses standard setup.py conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a conventional Python setup configuration using setuptools. It reads a markdown file for the long description and specifies package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and URLs. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or user inputs processed at runtime. All modules and variables appear standard for a Python package setup. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical package configuration file with no suspicious or harmful elements.",
