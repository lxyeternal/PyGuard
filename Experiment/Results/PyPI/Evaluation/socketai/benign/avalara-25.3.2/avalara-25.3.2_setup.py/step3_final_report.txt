  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the Python module 'Avalara'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; package metadata and dependencies are specified directly in the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; dependencies are standard and no dynamic code execution occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content; proceeds to call setup() with package info; no external data flows beyond initial file read.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and follows typical packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The reports provided are empty responses with no detailed findings, making it impossible to identify vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. Given the absence of suspicious activity, the code appears benign. The lack of detailed report content suggests either a failure in report collection or no issues found. Therefore, the malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score 0, aligning with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe packaging script with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The reports lack substantive data; thus, the scores should be minimal. No further action is necessary based on current information.",
