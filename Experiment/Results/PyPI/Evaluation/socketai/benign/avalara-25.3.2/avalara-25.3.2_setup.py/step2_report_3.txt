  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The provided code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python module.\n   - It reads the README.md for the long description.\n   - The package is named 'Avalara' with version '25.3.2'.\n   - The source code is expected to be in the 'src' directory, with a package named 'avalara'.\n   - The author list and contact email are specified.\n   - It specifies dependencies (`requests`) and extra test dependencies (`pytest`, `pytest-cov`, `tox`).\n   - Classifiers include support for Python 2.7 and 3.6, indicating some legacy support.\n\n**Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code appears standard and does not contain any obvious malicious or insecure patterns.\n- No suspicious imports or code execution.\n- No obfuscation or hidden code.\n- No signs of malware, malicious dependencies, or code injection.\n\n2. **Review of the Reports:**\n- All reports indicate `\"error\": \"Empty response\"` with no raw response content.\n- There is no detailed information, no code snippets, no explanations, just empty responses.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n- The reports do not provide any concrete findings, vulnerabilities, or malicious indicators.\n- The \"Empty response\" suggests either a failure in report collection or a lack of issues found.\n- Without detailed content, it is impossible to identify specific vulnerabilities, malware, or flaws.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n- Since no issues are reported or evident, the malware score should be **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should also be **0**, as there's no evidence of obfuscation.\n- The risk score should be **0** unless there is evidence of a security concern.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns:**\n- The only minor concern could be the support for Python 2.7, which is deprecated, but that is not a security issue per se.\n- The package dependencies are standard (`requests`), with no known malicious packages.\n\n6. **Final Assessment:**\n- Based on the provided code and the empty reports, there are no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores should be:\n  - Malware: **0**\n  - Obfuscated: **0**\n  - Risk: **0**\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code appears safe and standard.\n- The reports do not contain any actionable information.\n- No evidence suggests malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI recommend maintaining the scores at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk, given the current evidence.",
