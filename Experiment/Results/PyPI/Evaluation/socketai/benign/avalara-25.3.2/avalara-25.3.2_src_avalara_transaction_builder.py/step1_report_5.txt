  "purpose": "To provide a Python class for constructing tax transactions within the AvaTax SDK, enabling users to build transaction data programmatically.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: comp_code, type_, cust_code; Internal data: datetime.now() for the date field.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data directly or perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are stored in create_model; datetime.now() populates the 'date' field; no data flows to external systems within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of datetime.now() directly for 'date' without sanitization; no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes with user-provided parameters for building a transaction object. The 'date' field is set using datetime.now(), which is standard. The class references an external module transaction_builder_methods, but nothing suspicious is evident from this snippet. No external data is fetched or stored insecurely; no apparent malicious logic or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard SDK component designed for constructing transaction objects. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are detected. It is a typical implementation with no suspicious activity.",
