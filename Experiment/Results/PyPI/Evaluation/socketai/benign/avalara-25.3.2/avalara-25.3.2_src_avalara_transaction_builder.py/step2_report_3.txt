  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines a `TransactionBuilder` class for constructing transaction data for the AvaTax SDK.\n   - It initializes with parameters: `client`, `comp_code`, `type_`, `cust_code`.\n   - It sets a `create_model` dictionary, including a timestamp generated via `datetime.now()`.\n   - The code relies on an external module `transaction_builder_methods`.\n   - No network calls, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present.\n   - The timestamp is generated using a standard method, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n   - No untrusted data sinks or external outputs that could be exploited.\n   - The use of `datetime.now()` is standard for timestamping, not suspicious.\n   - The external module `transaction_builder_methods` is not provided, but its usage appears standard.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0 for all reports. The code shows no signs of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0, as no obfuscation is evident.\n   - **Risk score**: All reports assign very low (0.1) or zero risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - **Confidence scores**: Generally high (0.9-0.95), consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions**:\n   - The only slight concern could be the `client` object, which might be used later for network calls. However, within this snippet, there's no such activity.\n   - The timestamp generation is standard and not suspicious.\n   - No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Conclusion & Recommendations**:\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - The code appears to be a standard SDK component with no malicious intent.\n   - No changes to scores are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score**: **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score**: **0.1** (minimal, standard SDK code with negligible risk)\n\nThis code is a legitimate SDK component for building transactions, with no security concerns identified in this context.",
