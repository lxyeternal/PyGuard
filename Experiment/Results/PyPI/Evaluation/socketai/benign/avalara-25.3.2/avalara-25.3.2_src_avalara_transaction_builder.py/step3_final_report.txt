  "purpose": "Constructs a transaction data structure for the AvaTax SDK, initializing with provided parameters and current timestamp.",
  "sources": "Parameters: comp_code, type_, cust_code; External module: transaction_builder_methods; Standard library: datetime.now() for timestamp.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no external outputs or untrusted data handling within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Initialization of create_model with parameters and timestamp; no data flows outside this scope.",
  "anomalies": "Use of datetime.now() for timestamping is standard; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward SDK class for building transaction data, with standard imports and initialization. No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation is detected. The timestamping method is typical and not suspicious. The external module usage appears standard. No hardcoded secrets or vulnerabilities are evident. The code is benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign SDK component for transaction construction. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
