{
  "purpose": "Define a TransactionBuilder class to facilitate construction of tax transactions using AvaTax SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports 'datetime' module and local module 'transaction_builder_methods'. Uses input parameters in constructor.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (client, comp_code, type_, cust_code) initialize internal model; datetime.now() populates date field.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class intended for building tax transaction objects. It imports necessary modules and initializes internal state with provided parameters. The datetime.now() is used to set the transaction date, which is standard practice. No external data is read at runtime beyond constructor parameters. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior found. The class appears to be a straightforward implementation of a transaction builder as part of an SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign SDK class for constructing transaction objects with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
