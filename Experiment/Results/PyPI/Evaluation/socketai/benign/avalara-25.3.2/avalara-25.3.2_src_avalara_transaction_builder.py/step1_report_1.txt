  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data or external outputs observed.",
  "flows": "The timestamp from datetime.now() is stored within create_model; no further data flows are shown.",
  "anomalies": "Use of datetime.now() to generate a timestamp is standard; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for building transactions, with initialization of attributes including current datetime. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, hardcoded secrets, or malicious data handling. The use of the datetime module appears standard. No external network calls, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate SDK component for transaction construction. No malicious intent or security risks are identified based on the provided fragment.",
