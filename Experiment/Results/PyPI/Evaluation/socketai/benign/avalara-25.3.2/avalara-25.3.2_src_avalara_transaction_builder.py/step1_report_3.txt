{
  "purpose": "The code defines a TransactionBuilder class to construct tax transaction objects using AvaTax SDK, providing an interface to build transactions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the constructor parameters (client, comp_code, type_, cust_code) and the imported modules (datetime, transaction_builder_methods).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the creation of the 'create_model' dictionary that could be used in API calls, and the use of 'datetime.now()' which could be manipulated if untrusted input influences code (though currently it is system time).",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to internal class variables and used to initialize the 'create_model' dictionary, which could be sent to an API endpoint via 'client' object; datetime.now() provides timestamp data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors. The 'datetime.now()' usage is standard for timestamps, not suspicious. The class relies on external 'client' object, which is not part of this snippet, so cannot verify its trustworthiness.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard SDK component, with no evidence of malicious behavior. It initializes a data structure for a tax transaction, using inputs from the user or calling process. There is no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. The use of 'datetime.now()' for timestamping is typical and not inherently malicious. The imported module 'transaction_builder_methods' is external and cannot be assessed here, but its usage is not suspicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a straightforward SDK class for building transaction objects with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
