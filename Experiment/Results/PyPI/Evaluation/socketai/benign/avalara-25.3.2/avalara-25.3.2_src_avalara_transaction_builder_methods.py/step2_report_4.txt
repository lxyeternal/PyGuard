  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard SDK builder methods, which match the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into `create_model`, used in API calls. No external data leaks or malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, standard SDK pattern, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, given the nature of SDK code, no evident security risk)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the straightforward nature of the SDK, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (no issues)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on the mixin class, again standard SDK methods, no suspicious code or malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low, typical for SDK code)\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Continues the pattern: standard transaction builder methods, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar analysis, no signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, straightforward data handling.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is a typical SDK builder pattern.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—SDK utility functions for building transaction models—risk scores are low, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or data exfiltration points are evident.\n- The data flow is confined within the internal data structures, with external API calls happening outside the code scope.\n- The functions are standard, with no malicious logic or backdoors.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malware)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, typical for SDK utility code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate. The code appears safe and legitimate, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The overall assessment confirms that the code is a standard, well-structured SDK component with no security concerns.",
