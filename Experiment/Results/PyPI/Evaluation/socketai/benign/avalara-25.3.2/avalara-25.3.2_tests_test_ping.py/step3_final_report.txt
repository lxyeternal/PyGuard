  "purpose": "Unit tests for verifying client ping responses and authentication status.",
  "sources": "Static test credentials within test functions, response text assertions.",
  "sinks": "Response text checks for authentication status; no untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Test functions call ping methods, then assert response content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious code or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward unit tests with static credentials and simple assertions. No dynamic or malicious code, no data leaks, and no external interactions are present. All reports agree on the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk (~0.1). The code is clear, standard testing code with no signs of sabotage or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of unit tests for client authentication and connection validation. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate and should remain as such.",
