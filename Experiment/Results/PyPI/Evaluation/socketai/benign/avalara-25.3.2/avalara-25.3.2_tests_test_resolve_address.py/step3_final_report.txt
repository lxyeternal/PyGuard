{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for an address resolution API, verifying response status codes and JSON data structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from fixtures like 'valid_address' and 'bad_address'. It also calls API methods via 'auth_client' and 'unauth_client'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the API endpoints invoked by 'resolve_address', which could process untrusted input, but in this context, they are controlled test calls.",
  "flows": "Input data from fixtures flows into API calls; responses are checked for status codes and JSON content, with no malicious data or external data leaks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic API response validation with controlled input; no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The tests are typical and do not involve dynamic code execution or data exfiltration. The overall assessment indicates a benign, standard testing suite.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward set of API unit tests with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be set to malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
