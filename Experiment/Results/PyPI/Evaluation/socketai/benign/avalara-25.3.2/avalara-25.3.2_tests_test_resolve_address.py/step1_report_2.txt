  "purpose": "Unit tests for address resolution API endpoints to verify correct responses and behavior.",
  "sources": "Input data: valid_address, bad_address; Data from auth_client and unauth_client methods.",
  "sinks": "Response parsing and status code assertions; no data sinks or external data flows observed.",
  "flows": "Input data passed to resolve_address method; response JSON accessed for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward test functions that validate API responses based on provided input data. The inputs are static dictionaries representing address data, and the code checks status codes and response content. There are no dynamic or external data sources, no unsafe code execution, nor any suspicious data handling. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code is present. The tests are simple and serve to verify correct API behavior without involving any security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of API endpoint tests with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any external data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is very low.",
