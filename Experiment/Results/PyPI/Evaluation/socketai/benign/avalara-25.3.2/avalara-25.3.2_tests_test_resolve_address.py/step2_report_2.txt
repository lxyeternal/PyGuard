  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code is a set of straightforward unit tests for an address resolution API.\n- All reports agree that the code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.\n- No suspicious data flows, external data leaks, or malicious payloads are identified.\n- The tests only invoke API endpoints with controlled input data and verify response status codes and JSON structure.\n- The code appears to be standard testing code, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious logic.\n- The input data (`valid_address`, `bad_address`) are static and controlled.\n- The API calls are straightforward, with no indication of malicious payloads or obfuscated code.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No issues are present in the code.**\n\n---\n\n### Flaws, Errors, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is standard, safe, and free of malicious behavior.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n- The scoring for malware and security risk is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Note:**  \nThe reports assign `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n**Any change in scores?**  \nNo, the scores seem reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports suggest any risk that warrants a score higher than 0.5.\n- The code is purely testing API endpoints with controlled data, with no malicious or risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and Validity:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior and structure.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**These scores reflect the benign nature of the code.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is standard API test code, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0. The code is safe and typical for unit testing.",
