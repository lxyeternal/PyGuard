  "purpose": "Unit tests for address resolution API endpoints, verifying response codes and data formats.",
  "sources": "Input data: valid_address, bad_address; API response data.",
  "sinks": "Response JSON parsing, status code checks.",
  "flows": "Input data -> API request -> Response -> JSON parsing and assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; the code appears to be standard test cases.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple test functions that send requests via auth_client or unauth_client to resolve_address endpoints with various input scenarios. It checks response status codes and JSON data types. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. There are no suspicious data flows, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The code structure and formatting are typical for unit testing. All interactions appear to be within a testing framework for API endpoint validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward unit test code for an address resolution API, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply verifies expected responses and data formats.",
