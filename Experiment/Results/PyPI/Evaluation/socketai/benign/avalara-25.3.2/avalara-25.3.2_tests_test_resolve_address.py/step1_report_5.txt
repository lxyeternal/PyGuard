  "purpose": "Unit tests for address resolution API endpoints and response validation.",
  "sources": "Function calls to auth_client.resolve_address() with input data, and assertions on response status and content.",
  "sinks": "None. No untrusted data processing or external data handling beyond API calls.",
  "flows": "Input data (valid_address, bad_address) sent to resolve_address() method; responses checked for status and JSON content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded credentials detected. All code performs standard testing operations.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises straightforward test functions verifying API responses for address resolution endpoints. It sends input data to the API client, checks status codes, and inspects JSON responses. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious code, or security issues. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious payloads are present. The code structure and logic are typical for testing frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard unit testing code with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs validation of an address resolution API without any suspicious behavior.",
