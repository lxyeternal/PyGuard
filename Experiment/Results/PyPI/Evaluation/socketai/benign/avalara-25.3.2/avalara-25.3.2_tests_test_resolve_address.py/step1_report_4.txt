  "purpose": "Unit tests for address resolution API endpoints, verifying correct responses and behavior under various authorization and input conditions.",
  "sources": "Input data: valid_address, bad_address; Data read from these variables.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly interacts with external systems beyond calling API methods, nor does it handle untrusted data in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke API methods with different inputs; response status and JSON content are checked, but no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. Tests are straightforward and typical for API validation.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises unit tests that validate API responses for address resolution. It checks for correct status codes and response structure under different conditions, including authorization scenarios and incomplete input. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious payloads. The code does not process untrusted input beyond standard API testing, nor does it perform any dangerous operations like executing code, network exfiltration, or accessing sensitive data. The overall structure is conventional for testing frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign set of unit tests for API endpoint validation. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks in this code. It is a standard testing script with no malicious behavior.",
