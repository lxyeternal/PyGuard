  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code consists solely of unit tests for an address resolution API.\n   - The tests perform standard assertions on response status codes and JSON data types.\n   - No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident.\n   - The code appears to be straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n   \n   **Conclusion:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is standard, benign, and contains no malicious or security risks.\n   - They do not identify any logical flaws or inconsistencies.\n   - The analysis is consistent with the code provided.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each report:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - Given the straightforward nature of the code, these scores seem appropriate.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, and the code is purely testing API responses without any suspicious behavior, a higher score isn't justified.\n   - The malware score is also 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on static analysis; no assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made.\n   - The analysis correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated code score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard set of unit tests verifying API responses. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
