  "purpose": "Unit tests for the TransactionBuilder class to verify its functionality and correctness.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'src.avalara.transaction_builder', test input parameters like auth_client, mt_trans, valid_address, and ship_from_address.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data outputs or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Test functions call TransactionBuilder methods to modify internal create_model state, then assert expected values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; no suspicious data handling or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests verifying various methods of the TransactionBuilder class. No external data sources or sinks are present, and all assertions check the internal state or output of the builder. There are no indications of malicious payloads, network communication, or sensitive data exfiltration. The code structure is standard for testing purposes, with clear and straightforward method calls. No anomalies, hidden code, or obfuscated patterns are detected. The tests focus on expected behaviors and do not include any code that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the TransactionBuilder class, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard testing functions without any suspicious or harmful behaviors. Overall, the code appears safe and free from supply chain security threats.",
