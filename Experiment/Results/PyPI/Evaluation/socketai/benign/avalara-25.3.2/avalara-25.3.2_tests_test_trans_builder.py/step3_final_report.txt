  "purpose": "Unit tests for the TransactionBuilder class, verifying method functionality with controlled data.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded test data within test functions; no external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no data leaks, network activity, or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke methods that modify internal models; no external data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of standard unit tests with fixed, controlled data. No external inputs, network activity, or system commands are present. The tests verify method behaviors and data manipulations without any suspicious or malicious constructs. The absence of external data handling or network calls indicates minimal security risk. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are observed. The overall structure and content are consistent with benign testing code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of unit tests for the TransactionBuilder class. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero.",
