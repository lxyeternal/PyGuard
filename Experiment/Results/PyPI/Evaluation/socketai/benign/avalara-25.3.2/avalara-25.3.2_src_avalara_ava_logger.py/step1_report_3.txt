{
  "purpose": "The code provides a logging decorator for HTTP request/response logging within a client SDK, including a utility to decorate all class methods except specified exclusions.",
  "sources": "Reads environment for logger configuration, and accesses HTTP response headers and request/response bodies.",
  "sinks": "Logs JSON-formatted data to logger (which may write to files or other outputs); accesses request and response data.",
  "flows": "Decorator wraps functions, captures response details, and logs them; error handling logs exceptions with request/response info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code appears standard and focused on logging functionality. No unusual code patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard logging utility using decorators to wrap HTTP request functions. It accesses request and response objects, logs execution times, headers, URLs, and bodies when permitted. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious actions are evident. The get_ava_log_entry function extracts headers and bodies securely, with optional logging of request/response content based on a flag. The decorate_all_methods utility allows applying decorators to class methods, excluding certain method names. Overall, the code is a typical logging utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate logging utility intended for debugging and monitoring HTTP client requests. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It operates within expected parameters for a logging module.",
