{
  "purpose": "This code provides a logging decorator for functions, particularly for methods in a client class, to log request and response details including execution time, and a class decorator to apply the logging decorator to all methods of a class except specified exclusions.",
  "sources": "Reading function arguments, especially the 'result' object in get_ava_log_entry; accessing headers and request properties from the 'requests' response object.",
  "sinks": "Logging to a logger which could output logs to files or consoles; potential exposure of request/response details in logs.",
  "flows": "Decorator wraps functions -> during execution, logs request/response data if available -> logs error information if exceptions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code or backdoors; usage of dynamic attribute access; logging request and response details could leak sensitive data if such data is present in request bodies or response text. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious external connections are found.",
  "analysis": "The code defines decorators for logging function execution, capturing timing, and request/response details. It uses standard Python modules and the 'requests' library. The get_ava_log_entry function conditionally logs request and response data, which could potentially include sensitive information if present. The class decorator applies the logging decorator to class methods, excluding specific methods. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious external communication. The primary security concern is the potential leakage of sensitive data through logs if request bodies or responses contain secrets. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for logging purposes and does not contain malware or malicious behavior. However, it could pose a security risk if sensitive information in request or response data is logged without masking. Overall, the code appears to be a standard logging utility with no signs of supply chain attacks.",
