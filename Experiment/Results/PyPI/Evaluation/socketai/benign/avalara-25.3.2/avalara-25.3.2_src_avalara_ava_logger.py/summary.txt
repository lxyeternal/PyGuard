  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging utility designed for HTTP request/response monitoring. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The primary security consideration is the potential exposure of sensitive data via logs, which is a common trade-off in such utilities but not indicative of malicious activity. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and a low to moderate risk score reflecting data leakage concerns."
