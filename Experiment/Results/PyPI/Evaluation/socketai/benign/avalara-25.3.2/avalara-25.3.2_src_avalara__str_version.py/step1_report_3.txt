{
  "purpose": "The code sets up type checking variables based on the Python version, specifically defining 'str_type' as a tuple of string types.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'sys.version_info.major' attribute to determine Python version.",
  "sinks": "Uses the value of 'sys.version_info.major' to assign 'str_type', which could influence type checking elsewhere in the program.",
  "flows": "Source: sys.version_info.major -> Sink: str_type assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. The code relies on standard library attributes without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'sys' module and checks the Python major version to assign 'str_type' appropriately for version-specific string type handling. This is a standard compatibility pattern for Python 2 and 3. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code performs a benign environment check to facilitate proper type handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility utility for Python version differences, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
