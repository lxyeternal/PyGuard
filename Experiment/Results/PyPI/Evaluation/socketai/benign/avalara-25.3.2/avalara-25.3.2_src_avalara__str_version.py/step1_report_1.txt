  "flows": "Reading Python version info from sys module, setting str_type accordingly",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard version-based type assignment",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, checks the major Python version, and defines a tuple of string types accordingly. The purpose appears to be to facilitate version-compatible type checking, which is a common practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code is straightforward and follows standard conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple environment check and type assignment without any malicious intent. It is a benign utility snippet used for compatibility across Python versions.",
