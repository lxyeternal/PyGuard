  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. Code is straightforward version check.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, checks the major Python version, and sets a tuple for string type checking accordingly. No external input, no data leaks, no malicious logic. It is a simple environment check for compatibility. There are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign environment setup snippet for compatibility, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
