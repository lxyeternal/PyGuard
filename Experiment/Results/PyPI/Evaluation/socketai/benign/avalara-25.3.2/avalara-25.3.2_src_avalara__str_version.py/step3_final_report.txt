  "anomalies": "None",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, checks the major version of Python, and assigns a tuple to str_type accordingly for Python 2 or 3. It is a straightforward compatibility utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The logic is correct, and the code is clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version check for compatibility purposes. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
