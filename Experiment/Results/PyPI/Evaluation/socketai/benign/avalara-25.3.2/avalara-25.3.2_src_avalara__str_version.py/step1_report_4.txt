  "purpose": "Define string type checking based on Python version for the AvaTax SDK.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info.major",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input (Python version info) influences the setting of str_type variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys module, checks the Python major version, and assigns a tuple to str_type accordingly. This is a standard environment check and type definition pattern, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscated logic, or security risks. No external inputs, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward environment check and type definition, typical for compatibility purposes. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
