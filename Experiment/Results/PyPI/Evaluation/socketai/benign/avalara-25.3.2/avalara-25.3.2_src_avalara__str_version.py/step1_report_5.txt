  "purpose": "Define a type tuple for string types based on Python version for use in type checking.",
  "sources": "Reads the sys.version_info.major attribute to determine Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks; no data flows to external sinks.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.version_info.major flows into setting the str_type tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version check and type assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python major version using sys.version_info.major. If Python 3, sets str_type to (str, type(None)); else includes unicode for Python 2. No external input, no data leaks, no suspicious behavior. No obfuscation, no malicious code. The code is a simple version check and type assignment relevant for compatibility handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign, version-dependent type assignment for string types, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
