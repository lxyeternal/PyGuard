{
  "purpose": "The code imports a class named AvataxClient from a module named client within the same package, likely used for interacting with an API or service related to Avalara's Avatax system.",
  "sources": "The import statement reading from the local module 'client'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing; only an import statement is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no apparent anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "This code only contains an import statement for a class within a local module. It does not execute any logic, handle data, or contain any risky patterns. There are no hardcoded secrets, network operations, or dynamic code execution. As such, it cannot be malicious by itself. The security assessment depends on the implementation of 'AvataxClient', but the import statement itself shows no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It is a standard code pattern for importing a class from a local module, and no malicious behavior is evident from this fragment.",
