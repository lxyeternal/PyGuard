  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this single line; it only imports a class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious activity are evident in this import statement; it appears to be a standard import.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement bringing in a class from a local module. It does not involve dynamic code execution, data processing, or external network activity.
