  "purpose": "This code snippet appears to be the header and licensing information for a Python package or module, specifying license, copyright, version, and encoding details.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the file's comments, license information, and metadata variables like __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no points where untrusted data could be exploited to cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident since the code only contains static comments and variable assignments without dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present; this is standard boilerplate license and version info.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments, copyright notices, and a version string assignment. It does not perform any operations, input/output, or dynamic behavior. The structure is straightforward and typical for open-source project headers. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as metadata and licensing information for a Python package. No signs of malware or security risks are detected.",
