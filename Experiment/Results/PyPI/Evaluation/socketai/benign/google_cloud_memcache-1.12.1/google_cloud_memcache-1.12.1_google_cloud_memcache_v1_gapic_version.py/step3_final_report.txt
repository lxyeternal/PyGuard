  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; only comments and a version variable.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and a single static variable assignment (__version__). There are no functions, data processing, input/output, or dynamic code. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is standard boilerplate for open-source packages, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The confidence level is high (1), and no further action is necessary.",
