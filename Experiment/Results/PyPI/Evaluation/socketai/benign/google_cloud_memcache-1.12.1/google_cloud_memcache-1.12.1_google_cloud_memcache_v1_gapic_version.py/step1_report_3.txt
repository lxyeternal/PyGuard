{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a header or metadata block for a Python module, providing licensing, copyright, version, and encoding information.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this code fragment.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sinks are present; this code does not perform data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists, as there are no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard licensing comments and a version variable assignment, with no suspicious or unusual code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comment headers detailing licensing and copyright information, along with a single variable assignment for the module version. There are no functions, data processing, external input handling, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be a typical, benign module header with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard metadata header without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any source-to-sink data flows, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. The overall risk is negligible.",
