  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is solely composed of license and copyright comments.\n   - There are no executable statements, data flows, or input/output operations.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign and contains no malicious activity.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the content.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree on zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk, there is no justification for higher scores.\n   - The code is purely informational comments with no potential for harm.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n   - No malicious behavior is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the actual content.\n   - They recognize that license headers are standard and pose no security threat.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the content described.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a benign license header with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis is a standard, non-threatening license header. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.",
