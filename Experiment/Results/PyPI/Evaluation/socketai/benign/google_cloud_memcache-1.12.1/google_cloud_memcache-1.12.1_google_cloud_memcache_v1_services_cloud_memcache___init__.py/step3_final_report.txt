{
  "purpose": "Defines and exports client classes for the CloudMemcache SDK, serving as a module initializer.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.async_client and .client).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Importing classes and exposing them via __all__, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard module setup with licensing comments and straightforward import/export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, containing only import statements and an __all__ declaration, typical for a package's __init__.py. It does not process data, execute dynamic code, or interact with external systems. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code's simplicity and lack of runtime logic indicate a benign purpose. The security risk score assigned in the last report (0.1) is slightly conservative; given the code's nature, it should be 0. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0, reflecting no malicious or obfuscated content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK module setup with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
