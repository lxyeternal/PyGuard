  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard import/export setup for SDK classes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or dynamic execution.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical SDK module with no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence & Scores:** High confidence (1). Malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the code.\n- No untrusted data, no anomalies, and standard import/export pattern.\n- **Scores:** All zero, matching the benign assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the straightforward SDK setup, with no data processing or dynamic code.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent with a benign SDK module.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, describes a typical SDK initialization file with no malicious activity.\n- No external data handling or dynamic execution.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, confirming the code's role as a benign SDK setup.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All zero, fitting the context.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard SDK module for Google Cloud Memcache, involving imports and exports without any data processing, dynamic code, or external input handling.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- **Security Risks:** The code is purely structural, with no evident security risks.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Justification:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. The code is a typical, benign SDK setup file, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive elements.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and poses no security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
