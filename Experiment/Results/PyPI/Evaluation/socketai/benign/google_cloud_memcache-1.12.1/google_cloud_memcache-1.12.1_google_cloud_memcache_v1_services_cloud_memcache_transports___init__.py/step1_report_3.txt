{
  "purpose": "Define and compile a registry of transport classes for CloudMemcache, enabling selection among gRPC, gRPC AsyncIO, and REST transports.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, and dictionary assignment for transport registry.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leakage points; the code primarily manages class references and imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; initialization of registry is static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. No dynamic code execution or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python modules and internal classes, then creates an ordered dictionary to register transport classes. No user input, network activity, or data processing occurs. The module exports transport classes and interceptors for external use. Overall, it appears to be a straightforward configuration/setup module without malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for registering transport classes for a client library. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It is safe and purposeful.",
