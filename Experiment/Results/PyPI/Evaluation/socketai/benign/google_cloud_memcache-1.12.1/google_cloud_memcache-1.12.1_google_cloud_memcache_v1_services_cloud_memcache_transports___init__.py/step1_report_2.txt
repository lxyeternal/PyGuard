{
  "purpose": "Define and register different transport classes for CloudMemcache, including gRPC and REST transports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest) and local variable assignments (_transport_registry).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaks occur; no external data outputs or network connections.",
  "flows": "Imports and class registrations are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. The code is straightforward, with standard Python syntax and structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports transport classes and creates an ordered dictionary to register these transports. It then defines the __all__ list for exports. All actions are static and consistent with typical package setup for modular transport management. No user input, external data, or dynamic code execution present. No malicious patterns, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python module for registering transport classes for CloudMemcache. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
