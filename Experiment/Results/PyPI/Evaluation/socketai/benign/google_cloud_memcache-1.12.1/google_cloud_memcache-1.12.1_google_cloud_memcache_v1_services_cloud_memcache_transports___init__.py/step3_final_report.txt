  "purpose": "Registry setup for transport classes related to CloudMemcache.",
  "sources": "Imports of transport classes and module-level dictionary assignment.",
  "sinks": "None; static registration without external data or untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Static registration of classes into an ordered dictionary, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific transport classes, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, user input handling, network activity, or embedded secrets. The code is a typical SDK internal setup module, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the benign and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard registry setup for transport classes with no malicious intent or security issues. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
