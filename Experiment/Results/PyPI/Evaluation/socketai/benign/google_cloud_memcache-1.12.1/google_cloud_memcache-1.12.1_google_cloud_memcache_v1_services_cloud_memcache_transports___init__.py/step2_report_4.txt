  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward registry setup for transport classes related to CloudMemcache.\n- No untrusted data flows, external inputs, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is standard, with typical Python module patterns, imports, and class registration.\n\n**Code Verification:**\n- The code imports specific modules and classes, then registers them in an ordered dictionary, and finally exposes them via `__all__`.\n- There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.\n- The license and comments are standard and do not indicate any suspicious intent.\n- No dynamic code, environment variables, or external data sources are involved.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5, with some at 0. This is appropriate because the code is purely structural and configuration-oriented, with no security risks identified.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- Since the code is static and contains no dynamic or external data handling, the risk of malicious activity is extremely low.\n- The only point to consider is whether the imported modules or classes could be malicious, but they are standard SDK components, and no suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Summary of Recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent.\n- No adjustments are necessary based on the provided analysis.\n- The overall assessment is that this code is safe, benign, and typical for SDK setup modules.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering minimal inherent risk, but given the analysis, 0 is appropriate)\n\nThis code poses no security threat and is a standard, safe component of a client library.",
