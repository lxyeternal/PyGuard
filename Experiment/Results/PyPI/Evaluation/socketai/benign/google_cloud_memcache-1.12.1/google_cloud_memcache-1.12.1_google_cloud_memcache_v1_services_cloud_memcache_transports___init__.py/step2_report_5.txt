  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code is a straightforward Python module that imports transport classes and registers them in an ordered dictionary, then exports them via `__all__`.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or data processing.\n   - The code appears to be a typical SDK setup component.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that there are no anomalies, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious patterns.\n   - The code is static, well-structured, and standard for package initialization.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The code is minimal and clear, with no suspicious or malicious constructs.\n\n4. **Score Justification**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, aligning with the absence of obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which seems appropriate given the analysis.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Scores**:\n   - Since the code is purely registry setup with no external input, no dynamic code, and no network activity, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unjustified.\n   - The malware score remains at 0, as there's no malicious activity or payload.\n   - The obfuscated score remains at 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - No claims in the reports are based on unfounded assumptions; all are consistent with the code's static and benign nature.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Final Expert Estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious intent or activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a standard, benign SDK module for registering transport classes. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are accurate and justified based on the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The reports are accurate; the code is safe.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n- The code poses no security threat.",
