  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library.\n- The code reads version info from a local file using regex, reads a README file, and calls `setuptools.setup()` with static data.\n- No dynamic data, network operations, or untrusted inputs are involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are detected.\n- The dependencies are explicitly listed with version constraints, and the code uses standard libraries and practices.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a package setup.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No untrusted data sinks; data flows are static.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious activity or security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, reasonable scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard setup operations.\n- Correctly notes that version extraction via regex is benign.\n- No suspicious code or external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also highlights the static nature of the script.\n- Mentions the explicit version extraction regex, which is safe.\n- Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1), perhaps due to cautiousness, but still reasonable given the context.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to previous analyses; confirms standard setup pattern.\n- No suspicious behaviors or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also confirms the script's benign nature.\n- No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No; all reports correctly identify this as a benign setup script.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; justified given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** All at 0 or very close to it; justified.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risk; standard package setup.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is a typical, safe setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, safe Python package setup script.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior detected.\n- Scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are; no adjustments needed.",
