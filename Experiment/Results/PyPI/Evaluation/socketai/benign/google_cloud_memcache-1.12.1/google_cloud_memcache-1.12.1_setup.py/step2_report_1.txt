  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Confirms that the script is a standard setup for a Python package, with no suspicious or malicious activity. The version is read via regex from a local file, dependencies are explicitly listed, and no untrusted data or code execution is involved.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate; the script is safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the setup script, with no dynamic or untrusted data processing beyond local file reads.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical setup script with explicit dependencies, static data sources, and no suspicious behavior. The only minor note is the regex version extraction, which is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — slightly above zero, but the reasoning is that the version regex could be considered a minor point of concern, though it’s standard practice.\n- **Justification for securityRisk:** Since the regex is applied to a local file with no external input, and the process is controlled, the risk is minimal. The score of 0.1 seems slightly high but acceptable given the minor concern about regex parsing, which is common in such scripts.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, confirming standard setup operations with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** The script is safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard setup script with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The script performs no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation with Report 3 at 0.1, but given the controlled environment and static file reads, this is acceptable. I would consider 0.0 or 0.1 as reasonable.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured setup script for packaging a Python library.\n- No dynamic or malicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- The version extraction via regex is common and safe in this context.\n- No external data or network operations are involved.\n\n### My estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.0 to 0.1** — minimal, primarily due to regex version parsing, which is standard practice.\n\n**Conclusion:** The package setup script is safe, standard, and free of security issues. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is acceptable given the context.",
