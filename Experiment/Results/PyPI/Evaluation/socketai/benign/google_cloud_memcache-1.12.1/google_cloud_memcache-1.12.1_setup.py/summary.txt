  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package, with no malicious or security issues. The minimal security risk score (around 0.0 to 0.1) reflects the standard nature of version parsing, which is safe. All reports correctly identify this as a safe, standard setup script. Therefore, the overall security assessment is that this code is safe with no malware or obfuscation concerns."
