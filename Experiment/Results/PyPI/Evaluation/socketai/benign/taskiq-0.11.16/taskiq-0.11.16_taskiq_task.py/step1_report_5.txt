{
  "purpose": "Defines an asynchronous task handler class for managing task status, results, and progress via a result backend.",
  "sources": "Reads input from method parameters, result_backend methods, and exception handling blocks.",
  "sinks": "Returns data from result_backend methods, raises custom exceptions, and performs sleep intervals.",
  "flows": "Inputs to methods trigger calls to result_backend methods; data flows from backend to return; exceptions are raised on errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious external calls, or unusual code patterns observed. The code primarily handles task status and results asynchronously.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward async task interface interacting with a backend, with exception handling. No obfuscated code, external network connections, or malicious actions detected. All methods serve expected functionalities without hidden or suspicious behavior. Usage of standard libraries and patterns suggests low risk of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard asynchronous task management class without malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious behavior identified. The design aligns with common async patterns for task handling.",
