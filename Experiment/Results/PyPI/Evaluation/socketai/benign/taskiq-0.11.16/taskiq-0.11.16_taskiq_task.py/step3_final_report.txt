  "purpose": "Asynchronous task result handler that interacts with a backend to check task status, retrieve results, wait for completion, and fetch progress.",
  "sources": "Backend method calls: is_result_ready, get_result, get_progress",
  "sinks": "Backend responses, exceptions raised from backend methods",
  "flows": "Backend method responses flow into return values or exceptions; data from backend determines task status and results",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward async wrapper for managing task results via a backend interface. It employs standard async patterns, exception handling, and relies on backend methods assumed to be secure. No user input is processed directly, and there are no external communications or obfuscated code. Exception handling correctly wraps backend exceptions into custom error types. The logic for waiting with timeout and polling is correctly implemented. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured async task result handler with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It operates as expected within a trusted backend environment. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal risk primarily due to reliance on backend trustworthiness.",
