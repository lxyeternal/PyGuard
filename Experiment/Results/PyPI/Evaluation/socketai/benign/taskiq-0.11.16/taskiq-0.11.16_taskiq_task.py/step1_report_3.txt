{
  "purpose": "Define an asynchronous task wrapper for retrieving task results, status, logs, and progress from a backend.",
  "sources": "Imports asyncio, time, typing; uses result_backend methods: is_result_ready, get_result, get_progress",
  "sinks": "Data flow from result_backend methods (assumed trusted) to caller; no user input or untrusted data processing present",
  "flows": "async methods call backend functions: is_result_ready, get_result, get_progress in source-to-sink sequences",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code, no obfuscated constructs, straightforward exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an asynchronous task management class, wrapping backend result retrieval and status checks. It includes exception handling that re-raises errors as custom exceptions. No external user inputs are processed directly; all data flows are from trusted backend calls. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical async task handler with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on trusted backend methods for task management and handles exceptions properly.",
