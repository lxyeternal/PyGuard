  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to identify any inconsistencies, errors, or potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code manages async task results via a backend interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted input processing or external data handling beyond backend calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward async result handler with proper exception handling, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9  \n*The security risk score is slightly above zero, but given the benign nature, this seems acceptable.*\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code interacts with backend methods, no suspicious logic, no external untrusted data processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9  \n*This is consistent and reasonable.*\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Also describes standard async task wrapper, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9  \n*Again, consistent.*\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Highlights that the code is a straightforward async wrapper, with no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9  \n*Zero security risk score is justified here.*\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar analysis, no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9  \n*Acceptable.*\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is consistent across reports, and none mention any actual vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign malware=0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1 or 0.2). Given the code's straightforward nature, these are reasonable and conservative scores. No actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a standard async task result handler, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary; the reports are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, with no security risks or malware. The minor security risk score is acceptable as a conservative estimate but could be zero for more confidence.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
