{
  "purpose": "The code implements an asynchronous task management class that interacts with a result backend to check task status, retrieve results, wait for completion, and fetch progress information.",
  "sources": "Reads include the 'task_id' attribute, calls to 'result_backend' methods ('is_result_ready', 'get_result', 'get_progress'), and exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks are present that handle untrusted input or data. The code mainly makes backend calls and raises exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input: 'task_id' and method parameters. Data flows from backend method calls ('is_result_ready', 'get_result', 'get_progress') to return values or exceptions. No external untrusted data is processed directly in a dangerous manner.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Exception handling re-raises exceptions with custom error types, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an async class to manage task results via a backend interface. It uses asyncio for non-blocking waits and handles exceptions to provide meaningful errors. No code injections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are apparent. The code does not process untrusted user input or perform insecure operations. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of asynchronous result management.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign implementation of an async task result handler, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It interacts with a backend via well-defined methods and handles exceptions properly. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
