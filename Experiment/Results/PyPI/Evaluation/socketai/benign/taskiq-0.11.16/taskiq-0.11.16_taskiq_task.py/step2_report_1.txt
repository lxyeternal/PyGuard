  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward async wrapper for interacting with a result backend, providing methods to check readiness, get results, wait for completion, and fetch progress.\n- No user input is processed directly; all data flows are from trusted backend methods.\n- Exception handling re-raises exceptions as custom error types, which is standard.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code relies on backend implementations for data handling, which are assumed to be secure and trusted.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or external communication beyond expected async result polling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code logic appears correct; no bugs or security flaws are apparent.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** Very low, mostly standard exception handling and async control flow.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The `wait_result` method correctly implements a timeout mechanism.\n- Exception handling is appropriate, wrapping backend exceptions into custom exceptions.\n- No suspicious data handling or external calls.\n- The code does not process untrusted user input directly, only backend responses.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports give 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports give 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which seems reasonable given the context.\n\n**Any adjustments?**  \nGiven the analysis, the scores seem appropriate. No report overstates or understates the risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2, reflecting low security risk, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The code is a typical async task result handler with proper exception handling.\n- No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The code's purpose and flow are transparent and standard for such systems.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the reports and the code, I concur with the given scores. The code is benign, well-structured, and poses minimal security risk.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's characteristics.",
