  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Describes a straightforward async task result handler.\n- Sources: Uses task_id and backend method calls.\n- Sinks: No untrusted data handling.\n- Flows: Data flows from backend methods to return values or exceptions.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. Exception handling is standard.\n- Conclusion: Benign, standard implementation.\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.2 (low).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar task wrapper for status/result/progress.\n- Sources: Backend method calls.\n- Sinks: Calls to backend, potentially handling untrusted data, but backend is assumed trusted.\n- Flows: Data from backend responses.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Standard, safe code.\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Asynchronous task handler.\n- Sources: Method parameters and backend calls.\n- Sinks: Backend responses.\n- Flows: Data from backend to caller.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical implementation, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: No security concerns.\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Async wrapper for task status/results.\n- Sources: Inputs and backend methods.\n- Sinks: Return data, exceptions.\n- Flows: Data from backend to output.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Straightforward, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard code.\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar async task management.\n- Sources: Inputs and backend.\n- Sinks: Backend responses.\n- Flows: Data flows as expected.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- Conclusion: Typical implementation.\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis:\n- **Code correctness:** The code snippets are consistent, with no signs of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign malware score 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal potential vulnerabilities, mostly related to backend interactions, which are assumed trusted.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- The code is standard for an async task result handler.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- Exception handling is appropriate and does not introduce security risks.\n- The backend methods are external and assumed trusted; the code itself does not process untrusted input directly.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, primarily due to reliance on external backend)\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.15 (average of the reports’ scores, rounded to reflect very low risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, well-structured async task result handler with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low risk scores are justified, and the code aligns with standard practices in asynchronous task management systems.",
