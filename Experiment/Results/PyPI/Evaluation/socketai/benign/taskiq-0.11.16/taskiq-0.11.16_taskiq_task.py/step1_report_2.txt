{
  "purpose": "This code implements an asynchronous task interface for checking task status, retrieving results, and progress from a result backend, likely used in a task queue or worker system.",
  "sources": "Reads the task ID, method calls to the result_backend object for status, result, and progress.",
  "sinks": "Calls to result_backend methods which may handle untrusted data or trigger external actions.",
  "flows": "The code calls result_backend methods with the task ID; the results are returned or used to control flow. No direct untrusted input is processed; the flow depends on external result_backend responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. The code is standard for task management; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns. Exception handling is generic, simply propagating errors from the backend.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an async class that interacts with a result backend to check task readiness, get results, wait for completion, and fetch progress. It employs exception handling for backend errors. No external input is processed directly; method parameters are controlled. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or secret exfiltration patterns are present. No obfuscation or malware-like behavior detected. The code structure appears straightforward and typical for such a system.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of an asynchronous task wrapper for interacting with a backend. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as intended for task status and result retrieval, with proper exception handling. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
