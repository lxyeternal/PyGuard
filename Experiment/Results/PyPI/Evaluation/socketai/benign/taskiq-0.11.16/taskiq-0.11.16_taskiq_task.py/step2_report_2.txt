  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Code Review Summary:**\n\n- The code defines an asynchronous class `AsyncTaskiqTask` that interacts with a backend to check task status, retrieve results, wait for completion, and fetch progress.\n- It uses standard async patterns, exception handling, and relies on backend method calls.\n- No untrusted user input processing, obfuscated code, or suspicious external calls are present.\n- The logic is straightforward, and the implementation appears to be a typical pattern for task result management.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description and appears functionally correct.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** Low, primarily related to backend trustworthiness, but nothing in the code indicates malicious intent.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No evident vulnerabilities, as the code does not process untrusted data directly or execute dynamic code.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** Benign, no malicious intent, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, standard backend interaction, no malicious behavior, high confidence.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Standard async task handler, no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, high confidence.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Straightforward wrapper, no malicious behavior, high confidence.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, standard async pattern, no malicious indicators, high confidence.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final thoughts:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, given the code's benign nature.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, mainly because it depends on the backend's trustworthiness, but the code itself is safe)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code provided. There are no indications of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks in this implementation.",
