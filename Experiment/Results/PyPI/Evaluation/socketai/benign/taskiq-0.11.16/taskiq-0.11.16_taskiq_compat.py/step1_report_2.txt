{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility functions for different versions of the pydantic library to handle data validation and serialization.",
  "sources": "Version retrieval from importlib_metadata, no user input, no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the functions mainly wrap pydantic methods and cache type adapters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports version info and defines functions based on pydantic version. For newer versions, it caches type adapters and uses model_validate and model_dump methods. For older versions, it defaults to parse_obj, dict, parse_raw, and json methods. All functions are standard wrappers around pydantic functionalities. No external data flows, no user input handling, and no dangerous code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign compatibility layer for pydantic, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
