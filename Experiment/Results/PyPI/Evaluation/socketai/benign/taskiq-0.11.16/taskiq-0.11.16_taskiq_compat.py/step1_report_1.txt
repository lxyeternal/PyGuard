{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility functions for different versions of the pydantic library, facilitating model validation, parsing, dumping, and copying.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version of the 'pydantic' package via importlib_metadata.version and uses the version information to determine which set of functions to use.",
  "sinks": "Function calls to pydantic's model validation, parsing, dumping, and copying methods; no external or untrusted input handling beyond standard library usage.",
  "flows": "Version check flows determine which set of functions are used. Input data for model validation functions (e.g., parse_obj_as, parse_raw, or model_validate) are potential sources. These are used internally in model validation routines; no direct network or file I/O is performed here.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present. The code adapts to library versions but does not perform any unusual or hidden operations.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the installed version of 'pydantic' and defines wrapper functions for validation, parsing, dumping, and copying models depending on whether the version is >= 2.0 or not. It uses standard Python practices, including cache caching for type adapters in newer pydantic versions. All functions are straightforward wrappers around pydantic's API. No external data sources, no system commands, no network calls, and no suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility layer for pydantic, with no malicious intent or malicious code present. It merely wraps existing library functions to handle different versions. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
