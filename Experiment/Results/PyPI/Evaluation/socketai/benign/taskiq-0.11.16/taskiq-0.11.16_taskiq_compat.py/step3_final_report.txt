  "purpose": "Compatibility layer for pydantic versions, wrapping validation, parsing, dumping, copying functions to ensure consistent API usage across different pydantic versions.",
  "sources": "Retrieving pydantic version via importlib_metadata, version-dependent function definitions, no external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no network calls, no external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Version check leads to different function implementations; functions invoke pydantic's validation and serialization methods directly.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward wrapper functions, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility wrapper for pydantic, utilizing standard library functions and pydantic's API. It performs version checks to define functions accordingly, avoiding external data sources or dynamic code execution beyond version-dependent function calls. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions are simple wrappers, and the version check logic is standard practice. No suspicious data flows or external data sinks are identified. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on external library functions and version checks, which are safe in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility layer with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It uses standard practices and does not introduce security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is effectively 0. The assigned scores in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
