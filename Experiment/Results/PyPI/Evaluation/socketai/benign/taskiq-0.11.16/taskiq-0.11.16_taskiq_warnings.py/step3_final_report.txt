{
  "purpose": "Define a custom warning class for indicating deprecated functionality in Python.",
  "sources": "Class declaration inheriting from UserWarning; no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the class is a static declaration with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a straightforward class definition with standard syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class inheriting from UserWarning, used for issuing deprecation warnings. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no dynamic behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0—are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code does not interact with external systems or handle untrusted input, further confirming its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless class definition for a custom warning, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The current scores are justified and should remain at zero across all categories.",
