  "review": "Let's review the provided reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code Confirmation**:\n   - The code snippet is a straightforward class definition:\n     ```python\n     class TaskiqDeprecationWarning(UserWarning):\n         \"\"\"Warning used to indicate deprecated functionality.\"\"\"\n     ```\n   - It matches the purpose described: defining a custom warning class for deprecation notices.\n   - No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All reports consistently state that the code is benign, a simple class declaration with no dynamic behavior, data flow, or external interactions.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or embedded malicious code are detected.\n   - The confidence level is high (1) across all reports, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - **Malware Score**:\n     - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**:\n     - All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Security Risk Score**:\n     - All reports assign 0, consistent with the lack of any security concerns.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - Since the code is trivial and clearly benign, there is no reason to adjust scores.\n   - The reports do not suggest any vulnerabilities or malicious intent, nor do they assume malicious behavior without basis.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The reports are accurate and consistent.\n   - The scores are appropriate.\n   - The code does not pose any security risks.\n\n**Final Justification**:\n- The code is a standard, harmless class definition.\n- No malicious or obfuscated activity is present.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence remains high, as the analysis is straightforward.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet. No changes are necessary.",
