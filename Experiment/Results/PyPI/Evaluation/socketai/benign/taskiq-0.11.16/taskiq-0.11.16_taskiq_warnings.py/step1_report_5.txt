  "purpose": "Define a custom warning class for deprecation notices in the codebase.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class declaration and string documentation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; this is a class definition only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; straightforward class declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom warning class 'TaskiqDeprecationWarning' that inherits from 'UserWarning'. It serves to issue deprecation warnings within a Python project. The class includes a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no potential for malicious behavior. The code is minimal, clear, and standard for defining custom warnings.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign class definition used for deprecation warnings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks present.",
