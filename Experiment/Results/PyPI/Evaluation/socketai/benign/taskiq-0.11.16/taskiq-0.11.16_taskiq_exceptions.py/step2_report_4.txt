  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Indicators:**\n   - All reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code appears to be a standard, well-structured error hierarchy for a task queue system.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code is straightforward and syntactically correct.\n   - The exception classes inherit from base classes, with string templates for error messages.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated score: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These are consistent with the analysis; no malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n   - The risk score isn't explicitly provided, but given the context, it should be low (near zero).\n\n4. **Justification for Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity or payloads are present.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is clear and readable.\n   - The overall security risk is minimal; the code only defines error classes and templates.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they carefully analyze the static nature of the code.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed; the analysis is cautious and accurate.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to zero, indicating no security threat)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for error handling in a task queue system. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- No malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- The code is safe and well-structured.\n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current assessment, reaffirming that this code poses no security threat.",
