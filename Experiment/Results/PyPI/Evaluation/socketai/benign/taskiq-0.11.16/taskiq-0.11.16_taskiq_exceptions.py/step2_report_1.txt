  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to a task queue system. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or external interactions. The code appears straightforward and purely for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a set of exception classes with static message templates, no dynamic or malicious behavior, and no suspicious patterns. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no security risks.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports indicate no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The code is standard, with no signs of sabotage or malware.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or harmful behaviors.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid speculative claims. They base their conclusions on observable facts: static class definitions, no external data handling, no network activity, and no obfuscation.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nThe scores are consistent with the detailed analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for a task queue system. There is no evidence of supply chain attack, malware, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \nNo changes needed. The current scoring accurately reflects the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is purely for error handling with no malicious intent.  \n- The scores are appropriate and should remain at 0 for malware and obfuscated, and 0 for overall security risk.",
