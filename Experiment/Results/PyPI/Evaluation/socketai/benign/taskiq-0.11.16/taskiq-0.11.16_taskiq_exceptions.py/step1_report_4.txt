{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error scenarios in a task queue system.",
  "sources": "No direct data input sources; class attributes and string templates referencing error details.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external communications in this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this is purely exception class definitions without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs; standard exception subclassing.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception classes for error handling in a task queue framework. It includes various specific errors for timeouts, broker issues, result backend problems, security, and task rejection. There are no dynamic data manipulations, external data processing, or system commands that could be malicious. The string templates serve as error messages. No evidence of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behavior is present. Usage of type hints and inheritance appears standard. Overall, the code appears to be a well-structured error hierarchy with no security risks or malware indications.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of exception class definitions intended for error handling in a task processing system. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or external communications. The structure is typical and safe. Based on this review, there is no evidence of malware or security threats.",
