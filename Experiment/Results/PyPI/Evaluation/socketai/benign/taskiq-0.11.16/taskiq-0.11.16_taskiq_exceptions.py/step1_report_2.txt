  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a messaging/task queue system, including errors related to task processing, broker communication, result backend, and security.",
  "sources": "Code defines exception classes and message templates; no data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leakage points; no data is processed or outputted from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling; exception classes and message templates are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward class definitions with static messages.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python class definitions for custom exceptions, primarily used for error handling in a task queuing context. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No user input handling, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The exception classes and message templates are static, and there are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes for a task queue system, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not process or leak sensitive data and contains no suspicious logic.",
