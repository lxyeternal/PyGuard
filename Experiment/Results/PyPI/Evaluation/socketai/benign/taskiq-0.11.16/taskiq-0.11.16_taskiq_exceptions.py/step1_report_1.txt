{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error scenarios within a task queue system.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs; the code only defines classes and string templates.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely class and template definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of class definitions inheriting from base classes, mostly for error handling. It uses string templates for error messages and defines various error subclasses related to task queue operations, security, and broker management. There are no signs of malicious behaviors such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be straightforward and purely for exception handling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes used for error handling within a task queue system. There are no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is well-structured, clear, and solely focused on defining error classes and messages.",
