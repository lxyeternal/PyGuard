  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling errors in a task queue system, including broker, result backend, security, and task-related errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, string templates, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Error messages and exception handling, primarily in string templates used for error reporting.",
  "flows": "Error occurrence triggers exception instantiation and possibly logging or user notification via string templates.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines custom exception classes inheriting from base classes, with no apparent malicious behavior. The string templates include placeholders for variables, used for error messages. No input handling, network operations, or data leaks are present. The imports are limited to typing and a module 'izulu', which appears to be a dependency for error base class. No anomalies such as backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for a task queue system, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
