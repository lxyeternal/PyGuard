{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a task queue system, providing structured error handling and message templates.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and string templates within the code; no external data input or dynamic sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external interactions; error messages are static templates.",
  "flows": "The code does not process data flows; it only declares exception classes with message templates.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from base error classes, with static message templates. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data handling, or network interactions. The code is clear, well-structured, and serves as a standard error hierarchy. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception classes for error handling in a task queue system. There is no evidence of supply chain attack, malware, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
