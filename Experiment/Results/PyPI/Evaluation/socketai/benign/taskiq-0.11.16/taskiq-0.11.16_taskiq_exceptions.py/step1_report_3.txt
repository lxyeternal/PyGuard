{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a task queue system, including error handling for broker, result backend, security, and task-specific errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' and 'izulu.root', class and attribute definitions, string templates, exception class initializations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data flows involving untrusted input are present; error messages are static or template-based.",
  "flows": "Error class instantiations and message formatting, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; use of templates is standard for exceptions; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of custom exception classes inheriting from base errors, with message templates and optional attributes. There are no external inputs, data processing, or network interactions. The code is straightforward and structurally simple, serving as error definitions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of structured exception classes for error handling in a task queue system. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign module for defining custom errors with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
