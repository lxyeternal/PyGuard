  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with no dynamic or malicious code present. The code appears straightforward, with no external data handling, network calls, or obfuscated segments.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious logic. No logical flaws or errors are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with their findings. Since there's no evidence of malicious code, these scores seem appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports suggest any risk above 0.5, and given the code's benign nature, this is justified. The code is purely for error handling, with no attack vectors.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior. No issues here.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code analysis—no malware, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes used for error handling within a task queue system. There are no signs of supply chain attacks, malware, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Recommendation**:  \nNo further action needed. The code is safe and well-structured for its intended purpose.",
