  "purpose": "A class 'TaskiqState' extending UserDict for dynamic attribute storage and access.",
  "sources": "Attribute access methods (__getattr__, __setattr__, __delattr__) interacting with internal 'data' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network calls, or code execution points present.",
  "flows": "Attribute access flows through __getattr__, __setattr__, and __delattr__ to the internal 'data' dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility class managing internal state via a dictionary with custom attribute access. It does not perform external operations, network activity, or execute untrusted code. The implementation is standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a dynamic attribute container extending UserDict. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening features are present. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
