  "purpose": "Define a custom state class 'TaskiqState' that extends UserDict for storing and managing attributes dynamically.",
  "sources": "Initialization of 'self.data' in __init__; attribute access via __getattr__; attribute setting via __setattr__; attribute deletion via __delattr__.",
  "sinks": "Potential attribute access and modification through __getattr__, __setattr__, and __delattr__, which interact with 'self.data'.",
  "flows": "Attribute access and modification flow: attribute name -> internal 'data' dictionary -> retrieval, assignment, or deletion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No use of eval, exec, or network operations. The code only manages internal state.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for internal state management, extending UserDict and overriding attribute methods to provide dynamic attribute access to an internal 'data' dictionary. It uses standard Python features without obfuscation or suspicious patterns. There are no external data sources or sinks involved. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a dynamic attribute storage class, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
