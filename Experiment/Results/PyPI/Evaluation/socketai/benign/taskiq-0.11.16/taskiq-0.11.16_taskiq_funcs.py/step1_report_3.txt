  "purpose": "Asynchronous utility function to gather and wait for multiple task results, with optional logging and timeout.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the list of tasks passed as arguments and from asyncio event loop.",
  "sinks": "Uses asyncio.gather and task.is_ready()/get_result() which are safe; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Collects task_ids, checks readiness, retrieves results, and handles timeout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code relies on external task objects.",
  "analysis": "The function manages asyncio tasks for checking readiness and retrieving results, using a loop with sleep for periodic checks. No external or untrusted data is processed in an insecure manner. The code handles exceptions during task ID removal gracefully. No obfuscated or malicious code detected. It uses standard asyncio constructs and external libraries safely.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for gathering task results asynchronously with timeout handling. No malicious behavior, no suspicious data leaks, and no malicious activity detected.",
