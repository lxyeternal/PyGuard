  "purpose": "Asynchronous collection of multiple task results with timeout handling.",
  "sources": "Task objects' methods: is_ready() and get_result(), task IDs, asyncio event loop.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Checks task readiness -> retrieves results -> stores in results dict -> returns ordered results.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated asyncio.get_event_loop(), no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard asyncio patterns to gather task results, checking each task's readiness and retrieving results accordingly. It manages timeouts properly and handles potential lookup errors. No suspicious external calls, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The external dependencies are typical for task management. The use of get_event_loop() is deprecated but not malicious. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility for managing asynchronous task results. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal concern, mainly due to reliance on external task objects and deprecated asyncio usage, which are not malicious.",
