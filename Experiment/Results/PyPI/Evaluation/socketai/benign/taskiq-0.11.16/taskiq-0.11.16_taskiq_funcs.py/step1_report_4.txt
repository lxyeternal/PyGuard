{
  "purpose": "The code provides an asynchronous function to gather results from multiple tasks, with optional logging, timeout, and periodic checks.",
  "sources": "Reads from task objects (`task.task_id`, `task.is_ready()`, `task.get_result()`), reads from asyncio event loop (`asyncio.get_event_loop()`).",
  "sinks": "Results stored in `results` dict; no external sinks or data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Inputs: task list and parameters -> checks task readiness -> gathers results -> returns tuple of results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious imports, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscated code. The use of `asyncio` functions appears standard. No suspicious network or system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code asynchronously checks the readiness of provided tasks, gathers their results, and handles timeout scenarios. The structure uses standard asyncio patterns and exception handling. No code appears to send data externally, modify system files, or perform any malicious activity. No use of sensitive environment variables, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated constructs. The task management and result collection are straightforward and seem legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of asynchronous task result gathering. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain threats. No suspicious or malicious code detected.",
