{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to asynchronously gather results from multiple tasks, with optional logging and periodic checks.",
  "sources": "The code reads task identifiers (task.task_id) and calls methods like is_ready() and get_result() on task objects, as well as accessing the asyncio event loop and system time.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if task.get_result() returns sensitive information; however, no explicit data exfiltration or external communication is present. No unsafe system commands or external network calls are detected.",
  "flows": "Tasks are checked for readiness, then their results are fetched, and results are stored in a dictionary. The flow involves task readiness checking followed by result collection, without any data passing outside the process.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard asyncio constructs and relies on external task objects. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. The use of get_event_loop() is standard, though deprecated in newer Python versions, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script employs standard asynchronous programming patterns to wait for multiple tasks to complete. It verifies task readiness, manages a timeout, and collects results. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The external dependencies (taskiq modules) are typical for task queue operations. No suspicious anomalies are identified, and the code’s purpose aligns with legitimate asynchronous task management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of asynchronous task result collection with timeout handling. No malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. It appears to be a legitimate utility function for managing task results.",
