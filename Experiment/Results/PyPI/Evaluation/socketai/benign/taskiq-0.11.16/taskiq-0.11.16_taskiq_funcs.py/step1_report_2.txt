{
  "purpose": "Asynchronous utility function to gather results from multiple tasks with timeout and logging options.",
  "sources": "Input tasks provided as arguments, task.is_ready() and task.get_result() method calls.",
  "sinks": "Results are stored in a dictionary and returned; no direct sinks to external data or network observed.",
  "flows": "Input tasks → check_task coroutine → results dictionary → return tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious loops, or obfuscated code detected. No external network calls or file manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward asynchronous task management utility, using asyncio features to monitor and retrieve task results. It uses standard asyncio constructs without any suspicious behavior. The functions called (is_ready, get_result) are assumed to be part of the task objects and are not inherently malicious. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious code patterns are present. The code handles timeouts and error conditions appropriately. The overall structure is clear and follows typical asyncio patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for managing asynchronous tasks. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data theft, or suspicious network activity. It is a standard, well-structured implementation for gathering task results with timeout handling.",
