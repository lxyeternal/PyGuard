{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to asynchronously gather results from multiple tasks, handle timeouts, and optionally fetch logs.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the list of AsyncTaskiqTask objects passed as *tasks, which are checked for readiness and results.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the retrieval of task results via task.get_result(), and removal of task IDs from the set, which could be exploited if tasks behave maliciously.",
  "flows": "Flow begins with receiving tasks, periodically checking each task's readiness, then collecting and returning their results in order.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden network connections. The code uses standard asyncio constructs and typical task management patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs an asynchronous wait for multiple tasks, monitoring their readiness and handling timeout scenarios. It manages task IDs and results using standard data structures. No obfuscated code features or suspicious logic are present. The task result retrieval and waiting pattern is typical and does not suggest malicious intent. No external network calls or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of asyncio.get_event_loop() is standard, and no secrets or environment variables are accessed. Overall, the logic appears safe and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical asynchronous task gather function with proper timeout handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. No indicators of malware or malicious activity are detected.",
