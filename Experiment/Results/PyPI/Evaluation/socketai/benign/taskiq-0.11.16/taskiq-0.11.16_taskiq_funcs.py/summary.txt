  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility for managing asynchronous task results. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal concern, mainly due to reliance on external task objects and deprecated asyncio usage, which are not malicious."
