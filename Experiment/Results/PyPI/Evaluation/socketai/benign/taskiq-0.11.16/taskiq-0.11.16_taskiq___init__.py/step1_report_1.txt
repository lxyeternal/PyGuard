{
  "purpose": "This source code defines and exports various components, classes, and functions related to a distributed task manager framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library ('importlib.metadata') and from multiple 'taskiq' modules and dependencies, mainly for configuration, broker setup, middleware, and task management.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data directly; code primarily consists of imports and module exports. No network or data handling is explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "The code imports dependencies, then creates a version identifier, and finally defines an '__all__' list for exports. No data flows are demonstrated within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. All elements are standard for a package initialization module.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as an initialization and export module for a Python package related to distributed task management. It imports various modules, retrieves package version info, and defines a public API. No input/output, network operations, or data processing are present. No signs of malicious behavior such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or code injection. The structure appears typical for a package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions to expose components of the 'taskiq' package for external use. No malware or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
