{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and organize imports and exports for a distributed task manager library called 'taskiq'. It sets up the module's public API and versioning information.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information via importlib.metadata and imports various classes, functions, and constants from multiple submodules within the taskiq package.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or write to sensitive locations within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing core components and exposing them as part of the module's API. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are observable in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and primarily consists of import statements and list definitions for exports. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes the package's version and constructs the module's public API through __all__. It imports core classes and functions essential for the task manager's operation. No suspicious code, malicious logic, or external data handling is evident. The code is structural, organized, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code snippet. It functions as a module initializer, setting up imports and exports without any malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
