{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports components for a distributed task manager framework, including brokers, middleware, errors, and utilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements loading modules and functions, including version retrieval and module dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no data leaks or security-sensitive operations evident.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports and re-exports modules and classes; no data flow from source to sink indicating security risks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected. The code appears standard for a package entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules related to task queue management, sets a version, and defines an export list. It uses standard importlib.metadata for version info, which is common. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or credential handling is present. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns observed. All elements serve to organize and expose package functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package module for a Python task management library. It performs no malicious activities, does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The structure is straightforward and intended for package setup and distribution.",
