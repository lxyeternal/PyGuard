{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various classes, functions, and constants related to a distributed task management system, likely for use in an application or framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'importlib.metadata', 'taskiq_dependencies', and various submodules of 'taskiq' which provide dependencies, classes, functions, and constants.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted input directly; the code primarily consists of imports and variable assignments.",
  "flows": "The code imports dependencies, then defines a version and __all__ list to expose certain symbols. No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks is visible.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports modules, sets a version, and declares exported symbols. All operations are standard and do not include data processing or network communication. There are no signs of malicious code such as code injection, data leakage, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that imports necessary dependencies and exposes a set of symbols. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks present in this fragment.",
