{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer (__init__.py) for the taskiq framework, importing modules, setting version info, and defining the public API.",
  "sources": "Imports from various taskiq modules and the importlib.metadata.version call to retrieve package version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or data processing operations.",
  "flows": "Import statements and setting __version__, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package __init__.py file, importing modules, setting version info, and defining __all__. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The use of importlib.metadata.version is a common, safe practice. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal security risk score assigned in some reports (0.1) is likely overly cautious; given the code's static nature, a score of 0 is appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization module with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature; the security risk score should be set to 0, and malware and obfuscation scores are justified as 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
