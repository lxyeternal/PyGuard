  "purpose": "Class for scheduling, message creation, middleware processing, and dispatching tasks via broker.",
  "sources": "Function args, kwargs, labels, task_id, schedule_id, broker, middleware hooks",
  "sinks": "Network transmission via broker.kick, schedule source for scheduling",
  "flows": "Create message from args/kwargs, process through middleware, serialize, send via broker, handle scheduling",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; middleware hooks are standard",
  "analysis": "The code implements a typical async task dispatch system with message serialization, middleware hooks, and scheduling features. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Network transmission via broker.kick is standard for message queues. Middleware hooks are configurable and do not indicate malicious intent. Serialization uses safe patterns (model_dump, asdict). No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an async task scheduler with message dispatching. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or high security risk is evident. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
