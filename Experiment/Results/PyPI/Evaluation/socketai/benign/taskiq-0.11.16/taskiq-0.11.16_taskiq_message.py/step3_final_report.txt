  "purpose": "Defines message data models for internal broker communication, including label parsing.",
  "sources": "self.labels, self.labels_types, external parse_label() function",
  "sinks": "In-place modification of self.labels via parse_label()",
  "flows": "labels -> parse_label() -> labels (modified in place)",
  "anomalies": "Use of external parse_label() without implementation; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code models message structures with Pydantic, including a method to parse labels using an external function. No network, file, or command execution occurs. The external parse_label() dependency could be a vector if malicious, but within this code, no malicious activity is evident. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is low (0.1-0.2) due to reliance on an external function whose safety is assumed but not verified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious activity. The only external concern is the parse_label() function, which should be reviewed separately. Based on the provided code, the overall security risk is minimal, and scores are appropriate.",
