{
  "purpose": "Define data models for task messaging in a broker system, including label parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data for label parsing (`labels`, `labels_types`), data passed into models (`task_id`, `task_name`, `message`).",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data flows into `parse_label()` function and assignments to `self.labels[label]`.",
  "flows": "Labels in `labels` are optionally parsed and replaced via `parse_label()`, but no external data flows into system outside input initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. `parse_label()` is an external function; its security depends on implementation, but is not inherently malicious here.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Pydantic models for message structures, with label parsing functionality. The parsing occurs only within the scope of the provided data, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior or data exfiltration. The `parse_label()` function's implementation is external; without its details, its safety cannot be fully assessed, but its usage appears standard. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected in this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured message data model with label parsing. There is no indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this code segment.",
