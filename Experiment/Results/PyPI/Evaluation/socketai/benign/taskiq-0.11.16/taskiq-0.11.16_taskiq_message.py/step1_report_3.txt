  "purpose": "Define message data structures for task handling in a broker system, including label parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data: labels, label types, message bytes.",
  "sinks": "parse_label function called on label data, potentially affecting label parsing.",
  "flows": "labels and labels_types -> parse_label -> modifies labels in place.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns, no dynamic code execution, no external data fetching or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models using pydantic for message serialization/deserialization, with an internal method to parse labels using an external parse_label function. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. The labels parsing is controlled, and no untrusted input handling appears insecure. The only external function used is parse_label, which is assumed to be a benign label parser from an imported module. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of message data models with label parsing, containing no malicious behavior or security issues. It appears safe based on the provided snippet.",
