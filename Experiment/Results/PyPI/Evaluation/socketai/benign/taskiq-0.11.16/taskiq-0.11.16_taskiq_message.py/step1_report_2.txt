  "purpose": "Define message structures for internal broker communication and label parsing in a task queue system.",
  "sources": "Self-contained data within class attributes (task_id, task_name, labels, labels_types, args, kwargs, message). No external data sources or inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as no external or untrusted data handling (e.g., network, file I/O, command execution) occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows within class methods, mainly parsing labels via parse_label function; no external or malicious flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. The parse_label function's implementation is not provided, but assuming it correctly sanitizes or processes input.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data models for task messaging using Pydantic. It includes label parsing logic, which relies on an external parse_label function. The models are designed for internal message formatting without external data fetching or command execution. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The parse_label function could introduce risks if maliciously implemented, but based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward data structure definition for internal messaging in a task queue system. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident within this snippet. The security risk is low, assuming parse_label is safe.",
