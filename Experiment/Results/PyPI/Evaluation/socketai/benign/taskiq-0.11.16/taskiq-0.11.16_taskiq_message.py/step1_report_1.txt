  "purpose": "Define message structures for task communication within brokers, including label parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data from external sources such as message payloads and label definitions.",
  "sinks": "Potential transformation of labels via parse_label; no direct data sinks like network or file writes present.",
  "flows": "Labels are parsed and transformed through parse_label function, which takes label data and label type as input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of parse_label function could be scrutinized, but it appears to be a standard label parsing utility. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data models using pydantic for message structures. It includes a method to parse labels based on label types, calling an external parse_label function. There are no dangerous or suspicious operations, external data transmissions, or credential handling. The code appears to be straightforward data modeling with label parsing logic. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for message data modeling with label processing. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and consistent with typical application code.",
