The main security consideration is the trust in the external coder implementation. Given the validation steps and structure, the overall security risk is low. The code can be considered safe for use provided the coder is secure and untrusted data is handled cautiously."

The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal concern, mainly due to reliance on external task objects and deprecated asyncio usage, which are not malicious."

It operates as expected within a trusted backend environment. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal risk primarily due to reliance on backend trustworthiness."
