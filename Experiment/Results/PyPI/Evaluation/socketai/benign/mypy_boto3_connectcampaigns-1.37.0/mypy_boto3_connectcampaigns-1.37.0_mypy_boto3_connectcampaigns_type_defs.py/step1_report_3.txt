  "purpose": "Type definitions for the connectcampaigns service, providing structured data models for API requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries, sys module for version checks, type annotations, and string literals.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or perform unsafe operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows mainly involve type annotations and structured data definitions; no execution or data processing flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed. Use of type annotations and conditional imports based on Python version are standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of TypedDict definitions and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. No dynamic execution, code injection, or malicious data handling mechanisms are evident. All code appears to be static type annotations and data structure definitions, with no external data inputs or execution paths. The use of sys.version_info checks and standard library imports is typical for compatibility and does not introduce security concerns. The code does not include any network operations, data leaks, or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or malicious obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward set of type definitions for a Python SDK or API client. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leakage, and no security vulnerabilities. It appears to be a benign, well-structured module intended for type hinting and code clarity.",
