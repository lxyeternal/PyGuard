{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and data structures for the connectcampaigns service, primarily for type safety and documentation purposes in Python projects.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, external modules, and imported type definitions. It does not process external untrusted data directly within the code snippets provided.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks such as network operations, file writes, or database queries are present in this code. The code only defines data types and request/response structures.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only declares types and data structures used elsewhere in application logic.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be standard type definitions and documentation comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Python type definitions using TypedDict and Union, conditional imports based on Python version, and module documentation. It imports standard and extension libraries, and uses standard patterns for version-dependent typing imports. There are no dynamic or executable behaviors, malicious functions, or data manipulations present. The code is purely declarative for data structure purposes. No malicious or suspicious activity is indicated by the structure or content of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard type annotations and documentation for a Python SDK. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is safe and aligns with typical SDK type definitions.",
