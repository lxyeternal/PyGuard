  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the context of supply chain security.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** The report states that the code defines type annotations and data structures for the connectcampaigns service, with no processing of untrusted data, no sinks, no data flows from untrusted sources, and no anomalies like obfuscation or malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely declarative, consisting of type definitions, conditional imports, and documentation. No runtime logic, network calls, or data processing that could introduce security issues.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. The report's confidence is high (1.0).\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. The code is safe and standard for SDK type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static type annotations, data structures, and no external data handling or dynamic code execution.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is static, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Use of standard typing patterns and conditional imports is normal.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security concerns. Confidence is high (1.0).\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Again, the code provides type definitions with no external data processing, network calls, or dynamic behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code. Use of sys.version_info checks and type annotations are standard.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or security risks. Confidence is high (1.0).\n\n**Verdict:** Correct; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** The same pattern—type definitions, no runtime logic, no external data handling.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior. The only minor note is the inclusion of a license date (2025), which is a future date but not malicious.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a standard type schema module, safe and benign. Confidence is high (1.0).\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar to others, with emphasis on no external data processing, no dynamic code, and no obfuscation. The only point is the copyright date (2025), which is in the future but not suspicious.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is static type definitions, with no malicious indicators. The slightly lower confidence (0.9) likely reflects the future date in the copyright.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or security issues.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type annotations and data schemas, with no runtime logic, external data handling, or network activity.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in the code snippets.\n\n- **Supply Chain Risk:** The code is standard for SDK type definitions, with no signs of malicious modification or malicious dependencies.\n\n- **Confidence & Scores:** All reports are consistent with the content. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated 0, and risk score 0 for all.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 for all reports, as there's no indication of security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for a Python SDK. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code content.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
