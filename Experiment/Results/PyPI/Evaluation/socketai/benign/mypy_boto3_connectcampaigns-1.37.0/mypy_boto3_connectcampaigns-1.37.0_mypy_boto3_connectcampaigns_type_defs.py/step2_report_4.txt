  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the provided code, and evaluate the validity of their claims, especially focusing on malware, obfuscation, and security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code defines type annotations for SDK type safety. No external data processing is involved.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows are present.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** The code is purely declarative, defining data structures with no runtime logic or external interactions.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; safe and standard.\n\n**Assessment:** This report is accurate. The code is standard type definitions with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the static nature of the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a straightforward set of type annotations, with standard practices for compatibility.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. The code is benign type annotation code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, accurately describes static type definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or dynamic execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime logic, no data processing, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Clearly safe.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as previous, accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Static type definitions only, no dynamic code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. The code is purely type annotations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code defines type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions the copyright date as 2025, which is in the future, potentially an inconsistency but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Static type definitions, no runtime or external interactions.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type annotations and data structure definitions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None of the reports find any signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n- **Security Risks:** The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Given the absence of any malicious logic, code injection, or suspicious patterns, the malware score should be **0.0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, with no obfuscation techniques. The use of conditional imports for version compatibility is standard. Score: **0.0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is only type definitions with no runtime logic or external interactions, the overall security risk is minimal. Score: **0.0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**The code is a standard, benign set of type annotations and data schemas for an SDK. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.**",
