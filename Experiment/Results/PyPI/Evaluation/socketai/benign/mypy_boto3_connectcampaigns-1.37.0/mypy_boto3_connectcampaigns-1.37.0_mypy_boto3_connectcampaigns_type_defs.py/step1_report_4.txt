{
  "purpose": "This code provides type definitions for the connectcampaigns service, primarily used for type checking and documentation within a Python SDK or application.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, typing_extensions, and local modules. Definitions of TypedDicts and literals for data structures and request/response schemas.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present. No network calls, eval, exec, or other execution-based sinks are found.",
  "flows": "Type definitions and data schemas do not process untrusted input or flow data in a way that leads to security issues. No runtime data flow analysis is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code. Use of conditional imports based on sys.version_info appears standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of static type definitions, import statements, and docstrings. There are no functions executing logic, no runtime data processing, and no code that interacts with external systems. It adheres to normal practices for defining data schemas in Python with type hints and TypedDicts. No malicious behavior, such as network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration, is present. The code does not handle untrusted input nor execute code dynamically. Its sole purpose is to define structured types for SDK use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of type definitions and documentation intended for SDK support. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It appears to be a benign, well-structured type schema module for a Python SDK.",
