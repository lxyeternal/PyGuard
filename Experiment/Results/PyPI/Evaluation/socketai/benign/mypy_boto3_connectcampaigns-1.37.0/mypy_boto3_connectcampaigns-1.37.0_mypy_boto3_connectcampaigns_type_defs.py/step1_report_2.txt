{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the connectcampaigns service API, used for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, and local literals module; hardcoded strings and literals within TypedDict definitions.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks such as network, file, or environment variable access are present; data is primarily used for type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks detected; mainly static type definitions and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected. Usage of Literal types and type annotations is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and conditional imports based on Python version. No runtime logic, user input processing, or network calls are present. All data structures define schema for API requests and responses. No obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The inclusion of license and documentation comments is typical and harmless. Import patterns and conditional typing imports are standard practice for compatibility and do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely static type definition code with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for inclusion in larger projects as a type schema module.",
