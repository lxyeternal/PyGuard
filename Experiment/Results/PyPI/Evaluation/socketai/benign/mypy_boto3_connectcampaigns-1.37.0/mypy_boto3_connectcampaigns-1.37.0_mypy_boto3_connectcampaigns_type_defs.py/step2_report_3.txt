  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is purely type annotations and data structures for SDK documentation. No processing of untrusted data, no network or file operations, no dynamic behavior.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no obfuscation, no malware indicators. The confidence is high (1.0).\n- **Assessment:** Completely benign, standard type definition code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static type annotations, conditional imports for compatibility, no runtime logic.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Safe, standard SDK code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—type definitions, static data schemas, no dynamic or external data processing.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Benign, well-structured type definitions.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Type annotations, no external input handling, no runtime logic. The only minor anomaly is the inclusion of a future date (2025) in the copyright statement, which is likely a placeholder or typo.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Assessment:** Safe, with a note on the future date as a non-security concern.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as others—type definitions for API schemas, no external data handling or code execution.\n- **Findings:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but no signs of malicious intent. The mention of a future date (2025) is probably a placeholder.\n- **Assessment:** Still benign, no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior. The code is purely static type definitions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any runtime logic, external data handling, or dynamic code execution, the risk score should be **very low (around 0.0)**.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard set of type annotations and data schemas for a Python SDK.\n- No network, file, or environment interactions.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future date (2025), which does not impact security.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, benign, and typical for SDK type definitions. No security concerns are present.",
