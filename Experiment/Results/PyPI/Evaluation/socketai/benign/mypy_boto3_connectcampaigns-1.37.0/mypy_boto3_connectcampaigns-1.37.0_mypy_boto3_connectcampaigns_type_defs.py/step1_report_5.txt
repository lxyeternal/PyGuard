{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the connectcampaigns service, facilitating type safety and clarity in API interactions.",
  "sources": "The code primarily reads static type definitions, imported modules, and constants; no external input sources are directly read or processed.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; the code only defines data types and constants without executing external commands or handling untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only declares type definitions and constants, not runtime data processing or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code includes a copyright statement with a future date (2025), which may be an inconsistency but not malicious. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or misleading variable names are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of type definitions using Python's typing system, including TypedDict, Union, and Literal, with conditional imports based on Python version. It imports standard modules and type extension modules, and defines various structured data types for API requests and responses. The implementation is straightforward, focusing on static type safety and documentation. No external data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. No indicators of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type annotations and data structures for the connectcampaigns API, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard SDK-like module for defining request and response formats.",
