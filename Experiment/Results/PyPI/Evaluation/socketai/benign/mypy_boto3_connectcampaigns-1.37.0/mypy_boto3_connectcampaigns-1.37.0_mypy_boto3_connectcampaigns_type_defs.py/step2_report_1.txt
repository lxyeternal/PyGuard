  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code to identify any discrepancies, suspicious elements, or inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely type annotations and data structures, with no processing of untrusted data, no sinks, no data flows, no anomalies, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that the code is static, standard SDK type definitions, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment that the code is benign and safe is accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate and well-justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is static type definitions with no external data processing or malicious intent.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is standard, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity suspected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, focuses on the static nature of the code, with no dynamic execution or external data handling.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the code is purely type annotations and data schemas, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n- **Analysis:** Appropriately notes the absence of malicious activity, dynamic code, or external data processing.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard SDK type definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also describes the code as static type definitions, with no external input processing or malicious behavior.\n- **Anomaly Noted:** Mentions the copyright date as 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date (2023). This could be a typo or an inconsistency but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is straightforward type annotations with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; appears benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.9 — *here, the risk score seems high given the benign nature.*\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n\n- **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:** All reports correctly identify that the code is not malicious or obfuscated. The scores reflect that.\n- **Risk Score (especially in Report 5):** While the code is safe, the risk score of 0.9 seems excessive. The only anomaly is the future copyright date (2025), which could be a typo or a placeholder, but it doesn't pose a security risk.\n- **No signs of supply chain attack, malicious code, or obfuscation** are present in any report or the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should be **0.0** for all reports, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be **0.0** for all, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, should be **less than 0.5**, ideally 0.0, unless there's an external concern like the future date, which is not a security issue.\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The high risk score in Report 5 appears unjustified and should be lowered.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- Adjust all malware and obfuscated scores to **0.0**.\n- Set the overall risk score to **0.0** or at most **0.1** if considering the future date anomaly.\n- No further action needed; the code is safe.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|----------------|------------------|------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0.0            | 0.0              | 0.0        | No malicious or obfuscated code. |\n| 2       | 0.0            | 0.0              | 0.0        | Same as above. |\n| 3       | 0.0            | 0.0              | 0.0        | Static type definitions only. |\n| 4       | 0.0            | 0.0              | 0.0        | No external data or execution. |\n| 5       | 0.0            | 0.0              | 0.0 or 0.1 | Future copyright date is not a security concern. |\n\n**Final note:** The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The high risk score in one report should be corrected to reflect the actual benign nature.",
