{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type annotations and data structure definitions for the connectcampaigns SDK, serving as type safety and documentation aids without executing logic.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class definitions, conditional imports based on sys.version_info, and documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "None; no runtime data processing, external data input, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; the code is declarative with no data flows or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type definitions, conditional imports for compatibility, and documentation. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security vulnerabilities are present. The future date in the copyright is likely a placeholder or typo, not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of SDK type annotations with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The high risk score in the original reports is unjustified; the appropriate security scores are zero across malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
