  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Describes type annotations and paginator class for connectcampaigns.  \n- Sources: Imports, including version info and type defs.  \n- Sinks: No external or sensitive data handling.  \n- Flows: The only flow is passing **kwargs directly to the parent paginator.  \n- Anomalies: Use of **kwargs is standard in boto3, though it could theoretically be exploited if untrusted input is supplied.  \n- Analysis: The report correctly notes that passing unvalidated **kwargs could be a concern but is typical in boto3. No malicious intent or backdoors are evident.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, standard implementation with minimal concern.  \n- Scores: malware 0, risk 0.2 seem reasonable.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Type annotations and paginator class for boto3 connectcampaigns.  \n- Sources: No external input reading; imports are static.  \n- Sinks: No data leaks or external outputs.  \n- Flows: No external data flow; internal class and method setup.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns.  \n- Analysis: Straightforward, with conditional import for Python version, no runtime data handling.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, standard code.  \n- Scores: malware 0, risk 0, confidence 1.0 are appropriate.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Type annotations and paginator class for listing campaigns.  \n- Sources: Static imports, no untrusted input.  \n- Sinks: No external or sensitive operations.  \n- Flows: No data flow from untrusted sources.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious code.  \n- Analysis: Standard class definition, no malicious behavior.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, legitimate boto3 stub code.  \n- Scores: malware 0, risk 0, confidence 1.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Type annotations and paginator class for connectcampaigns.  \n- Sources: Imports and class setup.  \n- Sinks: No data leaks or malicious effects.  \n- Flows: No external data flow, just class and method definitions.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns.  \n- Analysis: Clear, well-documented, standard pattern for boto3.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, no malicious activity.  \n- Scores: malware 0, risk 0, confidence 1.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Type annotations and paginator class for connectcampaigns.  \n- Sources: Imports with version handling.  \n- Sinks: No external or sensitive data handling.  \n- Flows: Conditional import based on Python version; no data flow from untrusted sources.  \n- Anomalies: Use of sys.version_info and conditional import is standard.  \n- Analysis: Typical pattern for compatibility, no malicious behavior.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, standard code.  \n- Scores: malware 0, risk 0, confidence 1.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe standard, well-structured boto3 paginator classes with type annotations.  \n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious logic.  \n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only minor concern is the use of **kwargs in `paginate`, which is typical for boto3 but could be exploited if untrusted input is passed. However, this is a known pattern and not malicious.  \n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code. Risk scores are low, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious code detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and well-documented.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, related to passing unvalidated kwargs, but standard in boto3 SDK.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured implementation of boto3 paginator classes with appropriate type annotations. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The slight concern about **kwargs passing is a known pattern and not indicative of malicious intent. Therefore, the overall security posture is very safe.",
