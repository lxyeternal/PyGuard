{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and a paginator class for the 'connectcampaigns' service client in boto3, specifically for listing campaigns.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own docstring, imports from system modules (sys, typing), third-party libraries (botocore.paginate), and internal type definitions from '.type_defs'. It does not read untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or external systems. The code mainly defines a class and method for pagination.",
  "flows": "The code sets up class inheritance and method signatures for pagination, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be standard type annotations and class definitions for boto3 paginators.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, imports, and a class definition for paginating AWS 'connectcampaigns' responses. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, and only defines a class with a paginate method that delegates to the parent class. No runtime data handling, network operations, or other malicious behavior is evident. The structure and content align with typical boto3 stub implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and a paginator class for AWS SDK usage. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a legitimate module for boto3 type hinting.",
