{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and a paginator class for the connectcampaigns service client in boto3, facilitating type-safe iteration over paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module and type definitions from '.type_defs', and imports from system modules, boto3, botocore, and typing extensions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform potentially dangerous operations such as network connections, data leaks, or code execution.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines a class that extends a paginator base class and a method that unpacks keyword arguments for pagination; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, primarily defining classes and type annotations; no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and boto3 components for pagination, defines a paginator class with a documented method, and handles conditional imports based on Python version. It includes type annotations for safer type checking and documentation. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be standard, well-documented, and intended for type-safe API interaction.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured type annotation and paginator class definition for boto3's connectcampaigns service. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
