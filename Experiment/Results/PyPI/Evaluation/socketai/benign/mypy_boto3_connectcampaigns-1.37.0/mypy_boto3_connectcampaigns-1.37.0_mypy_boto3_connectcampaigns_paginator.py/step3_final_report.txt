  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definition for boto3 connectcampaigns paginator, facilitating listing campaigns with type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data outputs; internal method calls only.",
  "flows": "The paginate method accepts **kwargs, which are passed directly to the parent Paginator class without validation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of **kwargs in paginate is standard in boto3 but could be exploited if untrusted input is supplied; no explicit validation or sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward paginator class with type annotations, conditional import for Python version compatibility, and a paginate method delegating parameters to the parent class. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The only minor concern is the passing of **kwargs**, which is typical in boto3 SDK design and not inherently malicious. The code is well-structured, documented, and aligns with standard SDK patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe boto3 paginator stub with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minimal security concern regarding **kwargs** is inherent to boto3's design and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
