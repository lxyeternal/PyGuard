  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definition for the connectcampaigns service client, facilitating type-safe iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Import statements for system info, type definitions, and boto3 paginator classes; class method for pagination.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; method calls are standard for boto3 paginator pattern, no data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Code reads system version info to determine import of Unpack, then defines a subclass with a paginate method returning PageIterator with response types.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of sys.version_info and conditional import is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a typed paginator class for boto3 connectcampaigns, including type annotations, conditional imports for compatibility, and a straightforward subclass implementation. No external input handling or data processing occurs, reducing risk. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code is documentation-oriented with standard patterns for boto3 SDK usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, well-documented type annotations and class extension for boto3 paginators, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues. It appears safe and intended for type-safe pagination in a larger project.",
