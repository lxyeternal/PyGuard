{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and a paginator class for the 'connectcampaigns' service client in boto3, facilitating type-safe iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads version info from sys.version_info, imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local modules (type_defs). It does not read external inputs or user data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present. The code does not process or output untrusted data or perform network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks. The only data flow involves internal type annotations and method overrides within the class hierarchy.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors, are present. The code follows standard Python typing and class inheritance patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a paginator class for the connectcampaigns client with type annotations. It conditionally imports Unpack based on Python version and assigns base classes for type checking. It contains no dynamic execution, external data reading, or security-sensitive operations. No malicious behaviors or suspicious code structures are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, well-structured type annotation and class extension for boto3 pagination. It appears to be safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
