  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-connectcampaigns package to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads environment variables indirectly via setup tools; gathers package data.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data output or external system calls present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no untrusted data flow from source to sink detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup.py structure. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code features.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path for reading the README.md file and setuptools for packaging. It constructs a long description from a local file.
