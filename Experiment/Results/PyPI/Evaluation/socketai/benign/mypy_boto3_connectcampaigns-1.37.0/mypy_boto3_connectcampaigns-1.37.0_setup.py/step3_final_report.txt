  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the Python library 'mypy-boto3-connectcampaigns'.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file; static package metadata; no untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data used for setup, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static setup script with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static setup.py script that reads a local README file and calls setuptools.setup() with predefined metadata. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. There are no signs of obfuscation, embedded secrets, or malicious payloads. All dependencies and package data are explicitly specified. The code's structure and content are consistent with benign package configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup file with no malicious or suspicious features. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
