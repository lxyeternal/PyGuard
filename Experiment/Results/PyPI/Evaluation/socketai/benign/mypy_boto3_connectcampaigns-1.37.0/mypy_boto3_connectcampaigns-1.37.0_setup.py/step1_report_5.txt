{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the mypy-boto3-connectcampaigns Python library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for the long description, and imports from standard libraries and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data processing; no external network or system commands are used.",
  "flows": "The script reads a file to generate metadata, then uses setuptools to package the library, with no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present; code is straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, reads a local README.md file for description, and calls setuptools.setup() with static package information. It specifies metadata, dependencies, and package data, with no dynamic or malicious code. The only external dependency is setuptools, used for packaging. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks that could leak data or cause harm, and no malicious code patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It performs expected operations for package configuration and distribution.",
