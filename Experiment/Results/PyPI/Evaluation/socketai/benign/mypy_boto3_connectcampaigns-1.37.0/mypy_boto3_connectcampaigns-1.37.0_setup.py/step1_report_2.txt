{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the package 'mypy-boto3-connectcampaigns' for distribution via setuptools, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, static package metadata, and dependencies from the code itself.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input data are present; the script does not execute or evaluate external input beyond standard setup procedures.",
  "flows": "The script reads a file for the long description and defines static configuration data, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic behavior are detected. The code is standard for a Python package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a static README file, and configures package setup parameters. All operations are static, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling. The code appears to be a typical setup script with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It follows common patterns for package distribution configuration.",
