{
  "purpose": "The script sets up the package 'mypy-boto3-connectcampaigns' with metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports setuptools and pathlib modules; reads environment variables via package data and install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data directly influences system state or network operations.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content -> passes data to setup() -> installs dependencies and package data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated parts present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script. It imports standard libraries and uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and other configurations. All data sources (file reading, static strings) are safe. There are no sinks or flows leading to potential malicious actions. No anomalies or obfuscation features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
