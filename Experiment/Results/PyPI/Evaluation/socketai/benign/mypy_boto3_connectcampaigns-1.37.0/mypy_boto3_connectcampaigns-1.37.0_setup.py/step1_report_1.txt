{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package called mypy-boto3-connectcampaigns, intended for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports setup from setuptools; uses hardcoded package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no data transmission or environment variable usage observed.",
  "flows": "Reads file content to assign to LONG_DESCRIPTION; uses package data; executes setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present. The license and author info are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and reads a local README.md file for description. It then calls setup() with static metadata, including package info, URLs, license, author, version, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no dynamic or untrusted inputs, no network calls, and no obfuscated code. The package dependencies are clearly specified with conditions, and no suspicious behavior or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. It solely provides configuration details for package distribution.",
