  "purpose": "Main interface for connectcampaigns service, providing access to client and paginator classes for AWS connectcampaigns API.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules (.client and .paginator). No external input or data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only defines imports and aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be straightforward module interface setup with documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a module for the connectcampaigns service, importing client and paginator classes from local modules. It defines an alias 'Client' for the service client class and specifies __all__ exports. The comments include documentation links and usage examples. There is no evidence of code injection, data leakage, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. The code is purely structural and documentation-oriented.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python module providing interface classes for AWS connectcampaigns, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It functions as a simple wrapper or interface layer, with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
