{
  "purpose": "Provide an interface for connecting to the connectcampaigns service, including client and paginator classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client and .paginator). No external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "None. No data processing, output, or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily defines imports and an alias.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The copyright date is in the future but is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple interface module that imports classes from local modules, creates an alias for a client class, and declares __all__ for export. The docstring provides usage instructions and documentation link. No input handling, no external data sources, and no sensitive data processing are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for SDK or API interface setup.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard interface wrapper for the connectcampaigns service SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is unlikely to be malicious or compromised.",
