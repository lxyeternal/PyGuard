  "purpose": "Main interface for connectcampaigns service, providing access to client classes and paginator.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator). No external data sources or input points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only sets up imports and class aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines module-level imports, class aliasing, and exports. It includes a documentation string with usage examples. There are no external inputs, no execution of untrusted data, and no suspicious logic. The code appears to be standard for a Python SDK wrapper module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
