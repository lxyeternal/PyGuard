{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface module for the connectcampaigns service, importing client and paginator classes and setting up exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), no external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "flows": "Import statements and class aliasing; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in documentation URL ('youtype' instead of 'youtube'), benign and likely a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface with no dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. The typo in the URL is a documentation issue, not a security concern. No obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious SDK interface module with no security risks. The minor URL typo does not constitute a security threat. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect the benign nature of the code.",
