  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the connectcampaigns service, including client creation and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), code comments, and docstring with usage instructions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code primarily sets up imports and assigns a class to a variable.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and defines variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes and functions, assigns a class to a variable, and provides usage documentation. No user input, network activity, or dynamic execution occurs. It is a straightforward module interface setup without any malicious or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module interface with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intentionally designed for SDK or library setup purposes.",
