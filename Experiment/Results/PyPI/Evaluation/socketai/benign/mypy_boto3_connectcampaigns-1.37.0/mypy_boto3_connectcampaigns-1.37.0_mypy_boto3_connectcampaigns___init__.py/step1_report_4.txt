{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the connectcampaigns service, including imports, type annotations, and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), static documentation string, and assignment of Client alias.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly module setup and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "Documentation contains a typo in the URL domain ('youtype' instead of 'youtube' or expected domain), but this is likely benign. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports local modules, sets an alias, and provides a docstring with usage examples. The import paths are relative, and the documentation is static. There are no data inputs, external data processing, or security-sensitive operations. The only notable point is the misspelled URL, which could be a typo or an indicator of a placeholder, but it does not appear malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard interface module with no malicious behavior detected. It functions as an API facade for the connectcampaigns service. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
