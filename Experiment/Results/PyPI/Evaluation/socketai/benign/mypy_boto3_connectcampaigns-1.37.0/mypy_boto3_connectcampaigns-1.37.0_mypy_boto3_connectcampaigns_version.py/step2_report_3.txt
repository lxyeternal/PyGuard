  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a static assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no dynamic behaviors, no external inputs, no data flows, and no suspicious constructs.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that there are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n   - No logical errors or omissions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated: 0`\n     - `malware: 0`\n     - `securityRisk: 0`\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity or vulnerabilities, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n   - No justification is needed for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware: 0`.\n   - The code contains no malware or malicious intent.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they rely on code inspection and logical reasoning.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code's nature.\n\n**Summary and my assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, static version string assignment.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should all remain at 0.\n- The confidence remains high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' findings.",
