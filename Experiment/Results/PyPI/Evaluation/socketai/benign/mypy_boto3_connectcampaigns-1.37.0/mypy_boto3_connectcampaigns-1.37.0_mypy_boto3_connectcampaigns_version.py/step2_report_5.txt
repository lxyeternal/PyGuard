  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - It includes a copyright comment.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or external data sources.\n   - The code is standard for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues or Malicious Behavior**:\n   - All reports agree that there are no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n   - The code is straightforward and static.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasonableness**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is consistent with the code content.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, also appropriate.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which makes sense given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Errors in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying the code as benign.\n   - No flaws or logical errors are evident in the reasoning.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is static and simple, there is no reason to assign any higher risk or malware scores.\n   - The reports are accurate in their assessment.\n\n6. **My Overall Evaluation**:\n   - The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and reasonable.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Summary**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThe code is a typical, safe version declaration with no security concerns.",
