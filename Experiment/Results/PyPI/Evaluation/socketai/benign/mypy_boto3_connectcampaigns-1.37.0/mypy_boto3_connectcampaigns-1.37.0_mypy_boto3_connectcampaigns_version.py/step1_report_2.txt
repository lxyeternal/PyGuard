  "purpose": "Defines the version string for the package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ variable from a string literal.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with a comment and a version string; no suspicious activity or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it contains a comment about the source of truth for versioning and assigns a version string to __version__. There are no inputs, no outputs, no external data sources, and no dynamic or insecure code constructs. The comment indicates a copyright notice, and the version string appears static and benign. No suspicious behavior, no embedded malware, or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version assignment with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a standard practice in Python packages to define a version string. No anomalies or risks identified.",
