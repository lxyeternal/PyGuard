  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Logic**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic code.\n   - The code contains only a comment, a copyright notice, and a static string assignment.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Anomalies**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python packaging practices.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the absence of any malicious indicators.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the clear, non-obfuscated code.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which aligns with the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Inconsistencies**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - No changes are necessary for the scores or conclusions.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is static, contains no external data handling, and is a standard version declaration, there is no reason to suspect any hidden malicious intent.\n   - The code's purpose is purely informational, serving as a version identifier.\n\n**Final Justification and Recommendations**:\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and should remain unchanged.\n- The overall assessment is that this code is benign, with no security concerns.\n\n**My Overall Estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
