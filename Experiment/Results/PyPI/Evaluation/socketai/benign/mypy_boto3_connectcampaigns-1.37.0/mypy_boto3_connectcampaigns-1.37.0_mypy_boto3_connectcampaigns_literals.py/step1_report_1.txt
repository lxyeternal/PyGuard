  "purpose": "Define type literals for the connectcampaigns service and related AWS resource identifiers.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string literals for type annotations and documentation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external or untrusted sources to sinks; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious patterns detected. The code primarily provides type aliases for documentation and type checking.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Literal' conditionally based on Python version and defines multiple type literals for use in type annotations. It includes a detailed list of AWS service names, regions, and other constants. No runtime data handling, external calls, or dynamic execution present. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The license and copyright information is benign, referencing documentation. Overall, the code is a standard static type definition file, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static definition module providing type annotations for AWS service names and related literals. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks present. The code is safe and serves its intended purpose of documentation and type hinting.",
