{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS connectcampaigns service and related resource, region, and service names for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type annotations and imports, primarily from the 'sys' module and 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or inputs; all data is static and hardcoded.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; the code solely declares constants and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed. The code contains standard conditional import for compatibility and static type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' to check Python version, then imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' accordingly. It defines multiple string literal types for AWS services, resource names, regions, and other enumerations. The purpose is to enable type hints for static analysis. All data are static string literals; no dynamic code execution, user input processing, or external data handling is present. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, providing type annotations for AWS service names and statuses. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured type declaration code intended for static type checking. No security concerns are identified.",
