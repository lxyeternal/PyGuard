  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-examining the code and the provided assessments.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a static type declaration module defining string literal types for AWS services, regions, and related constants.\n- No dynamic code, external data handling, or runtime logic.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n- The code uses standard patterns, including conditional import for Python version compatibility.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as static type definitions with documentation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1, justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes static string literals and version-dependent import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly states that the code is purely declarative with no dynamic behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns; the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, correctly identifies static definitions and compatibility handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly concludes the code is benign, with no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0, fitting.\n- **Confidence:** 1, justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern; no dynamic code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes no external interactions or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0, suitable.\n- **Confidence:** 1, justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states static string literals for AWS identifiers.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately concludes that the code is solely for type annotations, with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1, justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static, purely for type annotations, with no runtime or external data processing.\n- **Malware risk:** All scores are 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscation & security risk:** None detected or claimed.\n- **Scores consistency:** All are consistent with the code's content and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert judgment:\n\nGiven the comprehensive static nature of the code, absence of any dynamic or external data handling, and standard patterns used, I agree with all reports' conclusions.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, well-structured static type declaration module with no security concerns.",
