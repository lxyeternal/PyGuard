  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literals related to the connectcampaigns service and AWS resource types.",
  "sources": "Imported 'sys' module for version checking; defined string literal types for AWS services and regions.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is processed or transmitted; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines constants and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward type definitions with version-dependent import for 'Literal'.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up string literal type aliases for AWS service names, resource types, and other enums, with a conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version. It includes a module docstring with usage documentation and a license statement. No input processing, data handling, or external communication occurs. There are no indications of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The only dynamic aspect is the conditional import for 'Literal', which is a standard compatibility pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign type annotation module for AWS SDK stubs. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are present. The code's purpose is purely to provide type safety and documentation for the associated AWS client.",
