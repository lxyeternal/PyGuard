  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code to identify any discrepancies, potential issues, or inconsistencies.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS services, regions, and related constants.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version for compatibility.\n- No dynamic code, external data handling, or runtime logic.\n- No secrets, credentials, or external communication.\n- The purpose is for type hinting and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Define type literals for connectcampaigns and related AWS resources.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, purely static type definitions.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected. The report is consistent with the code.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Define type literals for AWS connectcampaigns and related resource, region, and service names.\n- **Findings:** Static string literals, no data flow, no external data, no anomalies.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a straightforward static type declaration. No malicious behavior.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Define type annotations for connectcampaigns and AWS components.\n- **Findings:** Same as above, static definitions, no dynamic code.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Define AWS SDK component type literals.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code, no data handling, purely static.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Define string literals for AWS service identifiers, operations, regions, etc.\n- **Findings:** Static string literals, no data flow, no external dependencies.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations & Critical Analysis:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely static, with no dynamic or external data handling.\n- The code does not contain any obfuscation, hidden logic, or suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose is to provide type annotations for static analysis, which is a benign and common pattern in SDK stub files.\n- The license and documentation references are benign.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or external calls.\n\n### **Scores Justification:**\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward static nature.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the static, documentation-like purpose.\n\n### **Potential Concerns or Challenges:**\n- The only dynamic aspect is the conditional import of `Literal` for Python version compatibility, which is standard and not suspicious.\n- No indication of any backdoors, code injection, or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n- **Justification:** The code is a static type declaration module, serving as documentation and type hints for AWS SDKs. It contains no runtime logic, no external dependencies, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a safe, standard static type definition file for AWS service and resource name literals. All reports are consistent and accurate. No changes are necessary to the scoring or analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is benign and appropriate for its purpose.",
