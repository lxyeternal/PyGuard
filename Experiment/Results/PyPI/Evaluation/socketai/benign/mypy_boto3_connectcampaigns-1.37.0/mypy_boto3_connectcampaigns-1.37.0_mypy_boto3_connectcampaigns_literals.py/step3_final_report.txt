  "sources": "Constants defining string literals for AWS services, regions, resource names, and paginator names.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; static definitions only, no external data or runtime data flow.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static string literal definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines string literal types for various AWS services, regions, and resource identifiers, using conditional import for Python version compatibility. It contains no runtime logic, data handling, or external dependencies. The code serves as type annotations for static analysis and documentation purposes. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The structure and content are consistent with standard SDK stub files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static type declaration module for AWS SDKs, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate it is purely for static type checking and documentation.",
