  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the conclusions are justified based on the code.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS services, regions, and related constants.\n- It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is a standard compatibility pattern.\n- There are no runtime data flows, external inputs, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code serves as type annotations for static analysis and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Static type literals for connectcampaigns service.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies that the code is static, benign, and purely for documentation/type checking.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Define type literals for AWS connectcampaigns and related resource names.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes static string literals, no dynamic behavior, no external data, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Set up type annotations for connectcampaigns and AWS resource types.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly describes the code as static, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Define type literals for AWS SDK components.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that the code is static, with no external data or malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** String literals for AWS services, operations, regions, etc.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as static, with no dynamic data or malicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there are no malicious behaviors or code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the static, documentation-like nature of the code, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The only dynamic aspect is the conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard and benign.\n- No signs of backdoors, hidden code, or malicious intent are present.\n- The code's purpose is purely to aid static type checking and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation**\n\nBased on the thorough review, I agree with the provided reports' conclusions. The code is safe, static, and serves its purpose well. No changes to the scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign static type declaration module with no security concerns.",
