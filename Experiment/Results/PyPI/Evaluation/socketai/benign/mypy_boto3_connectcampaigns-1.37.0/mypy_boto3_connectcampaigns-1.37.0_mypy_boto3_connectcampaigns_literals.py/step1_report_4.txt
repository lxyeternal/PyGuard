{
  "purpose": "Defines type literals for various AWS SDK components and service names for use with mypy static type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions, definitions of string literal types for AWS services and regions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data or lead to data leaks; no network or system calls present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines constants and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only type annotation definitions; no dynamic execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type aliases for AWS service names, regions, and specific string literals, conditional import for typing.Literal based on Python version, and exports these as module variables. There is no dynamic code, no data processing, and no interaction with external systems. No hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns are present. The code serves purely as type annotations to improve static checking and documentation. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign set of type definitions for AWS service and region names, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It is a straightforward, safe module meant to aid static type checking.",
