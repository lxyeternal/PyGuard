{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS service identifiers, operation names, regions, and internal types for the connectcampaigns service.",
  "sources": "The source of data is primarily static string literals assigned to type variables. No user input, external files, or environment variables are read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows to cause data leaks, system effects, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Since the code consists solely of type definitions with no data flow or processing logic, there are no source-to-sink flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors, are present. The code is straightforward and consists solely of type annotations and string literals.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version to conditionally import 'Literal' for type annotations, then defines multiple string literal types for AWS services, regions, and other categories. The types are used for type hinting in larger codebases, enhancing code clarity and type safety. The code is static, with no dynamic execution, external data reading, or suspicious constructs. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. All strings are standard AWS identifiers and service names, with no signs of tampering.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining type annotations for AWS service identifiers and does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, safe part of a larger codebase, likely used for static type checking and improving code correctness.",
