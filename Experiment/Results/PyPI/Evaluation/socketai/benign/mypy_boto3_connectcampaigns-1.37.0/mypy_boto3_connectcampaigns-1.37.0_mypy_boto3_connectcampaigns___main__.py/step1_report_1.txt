  "purpose": "Provides CLI commands to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "targets": "Outputs to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument, then either outputs version or package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that responds to '--version' command with the package version and otherwise prints package details. It uses standard Python sys module functions for input/output. No external data sources, no user input sanitization concerns, and no suspicious code paths or hidden behaviors are present. No evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code does not invoke external commands or access sensitive environment variables. It is a minimal utility script intended for informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves purely as a CLI interface for displaying package information and version. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
