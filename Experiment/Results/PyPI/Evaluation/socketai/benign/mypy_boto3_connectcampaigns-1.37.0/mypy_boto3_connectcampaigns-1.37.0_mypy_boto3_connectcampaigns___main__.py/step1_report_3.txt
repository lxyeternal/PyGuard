  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides information about boto3 ConnectCampaignService.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (for command-line arguments), sys.stdout (for output messages)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs info to stdout)",
  "flows": "Command-line input (e.g., '--version') triggers print_version(), which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info() is called to output package details.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, serving as a command-line interface that displays package information or version details. It relies on standard input and output without processing untrusted data or executing external commands. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code does not interact with external services, files, or environments that could be exploited. The only input is command-line arguments, which are handled securely and predictably.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI utility with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It functions solely to display static package information and version details, with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
