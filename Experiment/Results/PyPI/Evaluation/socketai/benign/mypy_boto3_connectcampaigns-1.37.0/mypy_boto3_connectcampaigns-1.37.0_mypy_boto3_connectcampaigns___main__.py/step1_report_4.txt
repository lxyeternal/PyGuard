  "purpose": "The script is a CLI entry point for a package related to boto3 type annotations, providing package info and version details.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Writing output to stdout using sys.stdout.write",
  "flows": "sys.argv is checked for '--version' -> if present, print_version() writes version info -> otherwise, print_info() writes package info",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code performs simple I/O operations based on command-line input without external network activity or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of functions to display package metadata and version info. It reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and outputs to stdout using sys.stdout.write. There are no external data sources, no untrusted inputs beyond command-line arguments, and no dangerous operations like system calls, network requests, or file manipulations. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and does not include obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility designed for displaying package info and version details. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and intended for informational purposes only.",
