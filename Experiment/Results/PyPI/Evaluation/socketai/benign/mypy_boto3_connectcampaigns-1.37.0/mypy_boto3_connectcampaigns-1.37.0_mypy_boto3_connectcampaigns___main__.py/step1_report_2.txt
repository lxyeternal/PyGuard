{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI entry point for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Input is read from sys.argv to determine if the version info should be printed.",
  "sinks": "Output is written to sys.stdout via sys.stdout.write().",
  "flows": "Command line argument '--version' triggers the print_version() function, which outputs the version; otherwise, print_info() outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code is straightforward and primarily for informational purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys to access command-line arguments and standard output. It defines two functions for printing package info and version. The main() function checks for a '--version' argument and calls the appropriate function. The code is simple, with no external input processing beyond sys.argv, and no data leaks, insecure operations, or obfuscated code present. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign CLI utility for displaying package info and version details. It contains no malware or security risks. The code is clear and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.",
