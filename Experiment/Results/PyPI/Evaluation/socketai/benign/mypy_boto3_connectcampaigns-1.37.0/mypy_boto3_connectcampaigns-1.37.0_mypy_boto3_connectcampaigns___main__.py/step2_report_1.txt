  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The script is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on a command-line argument.\n   - It uses `sys.argv` to detect `--version`.\n   - It writes output via `sys.stdout.write`.\n   - There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no user input processing beyond command-line args.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n2. **Report Summaries & Analysis**:\n   - All five reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and serves purely informational purposes.\n   - They consistently state that no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**:\n     - All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n     - No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malware behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**:\n     - All reports assign `0`, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk Score**:\n     - All reports assign `0`, which is justified given the lack of vulnerabilities or risky operations.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - The code is very simple; there are no hidden behaviors or complex logic.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No need to adjust scores.\n\n5. **Overall Risk Assessment**:\n   - The code is a benign CLI utility with no security risks.\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate.\n   - The confidence in these assessments is high.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- Based on the code and reports, I agree with the current scores.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is entirely benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern indicators. The reports are accurate and consistent.",
