  "purpose": "A minimal CLI utility that outputs package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout using sys.stdout.write",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) -> conditional branch -> stdout.write output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static code with no dynamic or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI script that displays static package info or version based on a command-line argument. It uses only standard modules, with no external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The logic is simple, correct, and serves an informational purpose. All security signals are benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving only as an informational CLI utility. No malicious, obfuscated, or security concern indicators are present. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified.",
