{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a CLI entry point for a package providing information about boto3 ConnectCampaignService, including version details and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), writes to stdout (sys.stdout.write).",
  "sinks": "Writing to stdout, no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check leads to calling print_version; otherwise, print_info is called, both writing static strings to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behaviors; the code only outputs static package info and version details. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it checks for a '--version' argument and outputs version info or package info accordingly. It imports sys for input/output operations, but no user input is processed beyond command-line args. No dynamic code execution, no external data sources, and no network activity are present. The functions output static, informational text, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility designed to display package information. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. The code is simple, static, and well-structured with no anomalies.",
