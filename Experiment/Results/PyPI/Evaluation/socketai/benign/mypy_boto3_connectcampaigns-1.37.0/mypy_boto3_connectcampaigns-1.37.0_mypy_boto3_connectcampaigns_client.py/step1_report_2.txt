  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the ConnectCampaigns service in boto3, providing type hints and structured API documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class and method definitions; property and method implementations.",
  "sinks": "None identified; all functions are interface definitions with type annotations, no execution or data handling code.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to method signatures with type annotations, no runtime data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code mainly consists of type hints and API documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard type-annotated interface for the boto3 ConnectCampaigns client, including exception classes, method signatures, and property definitions. No runtime logic, dynamic code execution, or data manipulation is present. It primarily serves as a type stub and documentation interface. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden code, or malicious side effects. The presence of import statements, class and method definitions, and docstrings align with typical SDK stub files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign type annotation and interface definition for the boto3 ConnectCampaigns client. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The code's purpose is to provide type hints and API documentation support, with no executable or security-critical logic.",
