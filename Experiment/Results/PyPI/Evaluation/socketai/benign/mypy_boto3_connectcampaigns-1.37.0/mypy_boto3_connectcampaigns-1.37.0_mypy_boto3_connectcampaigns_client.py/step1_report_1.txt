  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the ConnectCampaignServiceClient to interact with Amazon Connect Campaigns API.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type definitions, and method signatures where data is read from parameters or imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive method calls that could interact with external systems or data, such as generate_presigned_url, create_campaign, delete_campaign, and other API interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (including untrusted data via kwargs) through method calls that interact with AWS services; notably, generate_presigned_url and campaign management functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of type annotations and method signatures follows standard patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. All imports and class structures appear standard for a boto3 stub interface.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured interface for interacting with AWS Connect Campaigns API, including method signatures for campaign management, presigned URL generation, and resource tagging. No suspicious logic or behavior is evident. All functions rely on external AWS API calls, and there is no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The class inherits from a boto3 base client, with clear type annotations and documentation links. No signs of obfuscated code or hidden functionality are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured interface for AWS Connect Campaigns API with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly provides method signatures and type annotations for AWS service interactions. No malicious or sabotage intent is detected.",
