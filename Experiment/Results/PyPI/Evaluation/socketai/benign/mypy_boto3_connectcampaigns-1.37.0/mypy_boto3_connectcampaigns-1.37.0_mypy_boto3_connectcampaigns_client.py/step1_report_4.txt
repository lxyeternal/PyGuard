  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the ConnectCampaignServiceClient, providing structured access to AWS Connect Campaigns API functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; constant string literals and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions.",
  "flows": "Method parameters unpacked from request type definitions, returning structured responses or simple types; no external data flow or command execution observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of dynamic features appears standard for boto3 interface stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type-safe interface definitions for a boto3 client for AWS Connect Campaigns, including custom exception types, property methods, and operation methods. The methods use type unpacking of request data and return typed responses, consistent with SDK stub patterns. No code suggests malicious behavior; it appears to be standard SDK interface code. All imports and code structure are typical and do not raise security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard, non-malicious SDK stub for AWS boto3 Connect Campaigns client. No signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior are present. The code is designed for type safety and API interaction, with no suspicious logic.",
