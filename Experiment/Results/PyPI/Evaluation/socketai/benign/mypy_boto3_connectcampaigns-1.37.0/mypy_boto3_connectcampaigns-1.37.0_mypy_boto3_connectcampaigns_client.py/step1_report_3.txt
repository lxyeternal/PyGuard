  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the ConnectCampaignService, enabling interaction with Amazon Connect Campaigns via boto3.",
  "sources": "Module imports, class definitions, method signatures, and property definitions that declare how data flows through the client interface.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that interact with AWS services, especially generate_presigned_url and any method executing external or network calls via boto3, which could be potential data exfiltration points if misused.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (kwargs) flows through method parameters to boto3 service calls; generate_presigned_url constructs URLs that could be misused if parameters are maliciously crafted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The code follows standard patterns for boto3 client stubs and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type-annotated method signatures for a boto3 client, including extensive use of type hints and imports for compatibility across Python versions. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious logic. The generate_presigned_url method could theoretically be misused to generate malicious URLs, but this is a standard boto3 feature. The rest of the code strictly defines interfaces and data flow for legitimate AWS service interactions. There are no obfuscated parts or hidden behaviors. The module appears to be a standard, well-structured SDK stub for Amazon Connect Campaigns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious interface for AWS boto3 service interaction with extensive type annotations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious anomalies are present. It is a normal SDK stub implementation aimed at providing type safety and improved development experience.",
