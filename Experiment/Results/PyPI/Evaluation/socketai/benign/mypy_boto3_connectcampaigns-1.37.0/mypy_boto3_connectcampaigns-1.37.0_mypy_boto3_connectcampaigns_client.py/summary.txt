  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard AWS SDK stub for the ConnectCampaigns service, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The minimal security concern relates to the potential misuse of URL generation features if untrusted input is supplied, but this is a known and inherent aspect of such SDK features. The malware score remains at 0, and the risk score is appropriately low (~0.2)."
