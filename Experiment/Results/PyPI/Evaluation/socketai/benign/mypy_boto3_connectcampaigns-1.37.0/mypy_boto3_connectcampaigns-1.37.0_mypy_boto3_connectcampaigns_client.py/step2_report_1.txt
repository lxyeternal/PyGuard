  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's structure, data flows, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a type annotation and interface definition for the ConnectCampaigns client, with no malicious code or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Assessment:** The code is primarily a stub/interface, providing method signatures, type hints, and documentation links. No runtime logic, data handling, or external system interactions are present beyond the standard AWS SDK pattern.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Scores are 0.0, which aligns with the absence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, given the nature of the code.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment is accurate; the code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a standard type stub with no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Confirmed. No runtime logic or data processing, just interface definitions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Zero, consistent with the code's purpose.\n- **Security Risk:** Minimal.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights that the code defines method signatures for AWS interactions, with some mention of generate_presigned_url.\n- **Assessment:** The generate_presigned_url method is a standard AWS feature allowing URL generation for resource access. While it can be misused if parameters are maliciously crafted, this is a common and documented feature, not inherently malicious.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscated code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Zero.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher (0.1), but this reflects the general risk of URL generation features rather than any malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a standard SDK interface; no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the standard nature of the SDK stub.\n- **Assessment:** No runtime logic, no data processing, just method signatures.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Zero.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the generate_presigned_url method, noting that untrusted parameters could influence URL generation.\n- **Assessment:** This is a valid point. The generate_presigned_url method accepts Params and HttpMethod, which could be manipulated if supplied with malicious data. However, this is a standard AWS SDK feature, and the risk is inherent to URL generation APIs.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns or backdoors.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Zero.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher (0.2) due to potential misuse of URL parameters, but not indicative of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** The code remains a standard SDK interface; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected. All reports indicate the code is a type stub/interface for AWS SDK, which is inherently safe.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the nature of the code, malware scores should be 0 across the board. The only slight concern is the generate_presigned_url method, which could be misused if parameters are untrusted, but this is a known feature and not malicious.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured SDK stub with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- The potential security concern with generate_presigned_url is a general feature risk, not a sign of malicious intent.\n- The low security risk scores are appropriate, and the malware scores should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — code is clear, standard SDK stub.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, related to URL generation features, but not malicious.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, standard AWS SDK interface with no security issues.",
