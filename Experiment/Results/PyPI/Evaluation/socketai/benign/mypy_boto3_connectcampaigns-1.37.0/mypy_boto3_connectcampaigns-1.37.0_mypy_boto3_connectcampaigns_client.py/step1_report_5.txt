  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the connectcampaigns service in boto3, facilitating interaction with Amazon Connect Campaigns.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class property and method parameters; docstrings referencing AWS documentation.",
  "sinks": "generate_presigned_url method uses Params and HttpMethod, which could be manipulated if untrusted; other methods accept kwargs unpacked from type defs, potentially influencing API requests.",
  "flows": "External input can influence method parameters such as Params in generate_presigned_url, or kwargs in API calls; these flow into API request constructions, which could be exploited if untrusted data is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs observed. Use of standard boto3 and botocore patterns, with no obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a client class with methods mapping to AWS Connect Campaigns API endpoints, with type annotations and documentation links. No direct handling of untrusted input is visible; methods accept kwargs unpacked from imported type defs. The generate_presigned_url method allows parameter customization, which could be misused if supplied with malicious values, but this is typical for AWS SDK wrappers. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The structure follows standard SDK client definitions and is not obfuscated or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured SDK interface with no malicious intent or malware. There are no signs of sabotage or security risks beyond typical API client behavior. The design and implementation are consistent with official AWS SDK patterns, and no malicious or suspicious activities are evident.",
