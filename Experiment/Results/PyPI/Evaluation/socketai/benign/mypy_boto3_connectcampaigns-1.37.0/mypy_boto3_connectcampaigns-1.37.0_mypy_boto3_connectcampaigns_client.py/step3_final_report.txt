  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS ConnectCampaigns client, providing method signatures, documentation links, and type hints without runtime logic.",
  "sources": "Method signatures, type hints, and documentation links; no data input/output handling or external system interactions beyond standard SDK patterns.",
  "sinks": "None; methods are interface signatures only, with no processing of untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Method calls passing parameters (kwargs) to AWS SDK functions; no internal data flow or logic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or backdoors detected; standard SDK stub structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface with type annotations for the boto3 ConnectCampaigns client. It contains no runtime logic, data handling, or malicious patterns. The generate_presigned_url method is a common AWS feature that can be misused if parameters are maliciously crafted, but this is inherent to AWS SDKs and not indicative of malicious intent. The scores for malware and obfuscation are appropriately zero, with a very low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflecting potential misuse of URL generation features, which is standard and not malicious. Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard AWS SDK stub for the ConnectCampaigns service, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The minimal security concern relates to the potential misuse of URL generation features if untrusted input is supplied, but this is a known and inherent aspect of such SDK features. The malware score remains at 0, and the risk score is appropriately low (~0.2).",
