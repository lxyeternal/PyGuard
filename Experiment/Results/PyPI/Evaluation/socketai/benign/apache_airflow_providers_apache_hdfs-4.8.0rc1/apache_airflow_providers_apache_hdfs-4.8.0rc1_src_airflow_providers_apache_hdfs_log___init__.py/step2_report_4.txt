  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the provided code is solely a license header comment.\n   - There is no executable code, data input/output, or logic present.\n   - No sources, sinks, or data flows are involved.\n\n2. **Potential for Malicious Behavior:**\n   - Since the code is purely comments, there is no mechanism for malicious activity.\n   - The reports consistently conclude that this is benign boilerplate license text.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - No errors or flaws are evident; they correctly identify the code as non-executable and non-malicious.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - confidence: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as harmless boilerplate.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made based on assumptions.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores align with the analysis.\n   - The conclusion that this code is safe and non-malicious is justified.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, as there's no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, comments are plain text)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (appropriate, no security risk)\n\n**Additional Consideration:**\n- Since this is purely licensing boilerplate, the risk scores could be considered definitively zero. There is no reason to assign any risk or malware scores higher than zero.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code snippet is benign, contains no malicious or suspicious content, and is standard licensing boilerplate. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My Final Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
