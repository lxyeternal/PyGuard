  "sources": "There are no data sources; the code contains only comments with no input or data reading mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist as there is no executable code; the snippet is purely comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard license header with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments, with no executable statements, data processing, or dynamic behavior. It contains no sources, sinks, or data flows, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the content. The reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, non-obfuscated, and safe, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard license header comment with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
