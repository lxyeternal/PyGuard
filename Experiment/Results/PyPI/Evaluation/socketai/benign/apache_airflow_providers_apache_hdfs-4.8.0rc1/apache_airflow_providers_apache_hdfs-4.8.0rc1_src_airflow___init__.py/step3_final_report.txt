{
  "purpose": "This code extends the __path__ variable for namespace package support using pkgutil.extend_path, a standard practice in Python packages.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and imports 'pkgutil' to extend it.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code performs a benign operation without data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "The source (__path__ variable) is extended via pkgutil.extend_path, with no external data flow or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard namespace package pattern with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical namespace package extension pattern, legitimate and widely used. The reports provided are all 'Empty response' with no detailed data or evidence. Without raw responses or additional context, there is no indication of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The code itself is benign, and the lack of detailed reports prevents any suspicion. The scores should reflect the absence of issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, benign, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The reports are incomplete or uninformative, with no evidence of security concerns. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is 0.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
