  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as solely consisting of licensing comment headers.\n- No executable code, data flows, or untrusted input/output points are present.\n- All scores for obfuscation, malware, and security risk are zero.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code snippets are just comment headers with licensing info.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- No data flows, input/output points, or anomalies are identified.\n\n**Logical issues or errors:**\n- No issues are apparent in the reports' reasoning; they correctly identify the code as non-executable metadata.\n- The reasoning aligns with the nature of the code snippets.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the absence of executable or malicious content.\n- The obfuscated scores are all 0, consistent with the clear, standard licensing comments.\n- The security risk scores are 0, correctly reflecting no security concerns.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n- Since all reports are consistent and accurate, no score adjustments are necessary.\n- The high confidence levels are justified given the nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is purely licensing metadata, posing no security risk.\n- The malware score should remain 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain 0.\n- The overall risk score should be 0, as there is no malicious or vulnerable content.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No further action or adjustments are needed.",
