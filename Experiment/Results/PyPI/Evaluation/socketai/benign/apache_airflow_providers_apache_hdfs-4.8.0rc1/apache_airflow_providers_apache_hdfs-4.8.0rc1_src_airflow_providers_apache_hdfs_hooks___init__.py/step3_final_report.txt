{
  "purpose": "The code contains only licensing comment headers with no executable statements or data flows, serving as metadata for licensing purposes.",
  "sources": "The comments themselves serve as the source; no data input or external sources are read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist, as the code is purely comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments with no executable code, data flows, or input/output points. All reports correctly identify the content as benign metadata. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, reflecting the absence of malicious or suspicious content. Confidence levels are high, given the straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or unusual behaviors are detected. The analysis confirms that the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely licensing metadata with no executable or malicious content. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. The overall security risk is negligible, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
