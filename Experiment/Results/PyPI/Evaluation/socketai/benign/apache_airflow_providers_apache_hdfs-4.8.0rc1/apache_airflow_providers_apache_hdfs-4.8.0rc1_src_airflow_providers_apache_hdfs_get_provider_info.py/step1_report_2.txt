  "purpose": "Provide metadata and configuration information for the Apache Airflow provider package for HDFS integration.",
  "sources": "Function get_provider_info() returning a dictionary with static data about the package, including package info, integrations, sensors, hooks, and connection types.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; the code only returns static configuration data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; the function returns static, hardcoded data without external input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected. The code is auto-generated and contains only documentation and static data.",
  "analysis": "The script is an auto-generated Python module that defines a single function returning static package metadata. It contains only predefined strings, URLs, and data structures with no external input, dynamic code execution, or network activity. No obfuscated code, malicious instructions, or sensitive data handling observed. The structure is straightforward, serving as a configuration or metadata provider.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, static metadata provider for the Apache Airflow HDFS provider package. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
