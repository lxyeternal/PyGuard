  "purpose": "The code provides metadata and configuration information for the Apache Airflow provider for HDFS, including details about integrations, sensors, hooks, and connection types.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data embedded within the function get_provider_info() and the license comments at the top.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code only returns static data structures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks exists; the function returns static metadata without external input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is straightforward and consists of static return data. The license comments are standard and contain no malicious content.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration function that returns a dictionary with metadata about an Apache Airflow provider for HDFS. It contains license notices and a function that provides structured metadata. No external input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, static configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines metadata for a provider plugin in Airflow.",
