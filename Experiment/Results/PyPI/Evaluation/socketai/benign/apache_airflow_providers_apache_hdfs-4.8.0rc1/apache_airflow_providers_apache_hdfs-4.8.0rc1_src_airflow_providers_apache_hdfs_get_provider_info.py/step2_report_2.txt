  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the findings with the provided code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a static, auto-generated Python function returning hardcoded metadata.\n- No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- The code is straightforward and serves as configuration or documentation data.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; describes static data, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which is consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no risks.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Also accurate; emphasizes auto-generated nature, static data.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct; no external input, static data, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct; static configuration data.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct; static metadata, no external data handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, static, and auto-generated.\n- The malware scores are appropriately set to 0 in all cases.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious activity are present or implied.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, static configuration script with no security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.",
