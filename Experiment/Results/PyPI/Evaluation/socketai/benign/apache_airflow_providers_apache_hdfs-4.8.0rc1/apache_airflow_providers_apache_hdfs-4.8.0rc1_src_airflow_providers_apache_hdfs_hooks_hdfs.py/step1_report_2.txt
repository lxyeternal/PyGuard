{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exceptions and a hook class related to Apache Airflow's HDFS integration, primarily for backward compatibility and deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code imports modules and defines classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; the code raises RuntimeErrors upon class instantiation.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of HDFSHook or HDFSHookException triggers RuntimeError with a deprecation message.",
  "anomalies": "The classes intentionally raise exceptions in their constructors, which is unusual for typical hook implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a deprecation message string, and then two classes: HDFSHookException and HDFSHook. Both classes, upon being instantiated, immediately raise RuntimeError with a message indicating the classes are obsolete and should be replaced or downgraded. The purpose appears to be enforcing deprecation notices rather than providing functional hooks. No untrusted data sources or external communications are present. The immediate exceptions prevent any further execution involving these classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or covert data leaks. The code is straightforward and solely serves as deprecation enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a deprecation warning mechanism for outdated classes in an Airflow plugin. It does not contain malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The use of exceptions to prevent instantiation is unusual but intentional for deprecation. No security risks are present.",
