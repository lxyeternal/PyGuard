{
  "purpose": "The code defines exception classes and a hook class related to Apache Airflow's HDFS integration, primarily providing deprecation notices and guidance for users.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading occurs in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; exceptions are raised intentionally.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only raises exceptions upon class instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "The classes are designed to raise RuntimeError immediately upon instantiation, which indicates they are placeholders for deprecated functionality. The code contains no malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It simply enforces deprecation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two exception classes and a hook class, all of which raise RuntimeError with a deprecation message when instantiated. There are no external data inputs, no network activity, no credential handling, or any suspicious activity. The purpose is to inform users about deprecated components and guide them towards alternative solutions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malware are present. The structure is straightforward, and the deprecation enforcement is explicit and harmless.",
  "conclusion": "This code is non-malicious; it solely serves as a deprecation notice for a deprecated Airflow HDFS hook and exception class. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks present.",
