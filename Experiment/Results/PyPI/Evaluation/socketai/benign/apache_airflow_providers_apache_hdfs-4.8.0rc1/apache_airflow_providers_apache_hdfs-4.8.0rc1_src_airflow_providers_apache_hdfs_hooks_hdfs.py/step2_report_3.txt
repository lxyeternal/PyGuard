  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose:** Deprecation notices for HDFSHook class.  \n- **Analysis:** The classes raise RuntimeError immediately upon instantiation, serving solely as deprecation enforcement. No external input, data flow, or malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely informational, no malware or security risk.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose:** Similar deprecation enforcement for outdated classes.  \n- **Analysis:** Classes raise RuntimeError immediately, no suspicious behavior, no external data, no network activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Non-malicious, intended to prevent use of deprecated classes.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as above, deprecation notices.  \n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, just raising exceptions to prevent deprecated class usage.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security issues, benign.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as above, deprecation enforcement.  \n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, just class definitions that raise exceptions on instantiation.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malware or security risk.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as above, deprecation enforcement.  \n- **Analysis:** Consistent with previous, no malicious intent, just raising exceptions to prevent deprecated class usage.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security threat.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify that there is no malicious code present. The code is simply designed to prevent use of deprecated classes by raising exceptions.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.  \n- **Risk score:** Since the code only raises exceptions and provides deprecation notices, the security risk is negligible.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior.  \n- No changes needed.  \n- The code is benign, serving only as a deprecation enforcement mechanism.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, straightforward deprecation notice implementation that raises exceptions to prevent use of outdated classes. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
