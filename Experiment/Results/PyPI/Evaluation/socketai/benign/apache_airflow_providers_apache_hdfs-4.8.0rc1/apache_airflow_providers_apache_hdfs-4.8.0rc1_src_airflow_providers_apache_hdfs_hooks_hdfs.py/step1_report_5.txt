{
  "purpose": "To define exception and hook classes related to Apache Airflow's HDFS integration, primarily for backward compatibility and deprecation handling.",
  "sources": "Static string _EXCEPTION_MESSAGE, class initialization (which raises exceptions).",
  "sinks": "Raising RuntimeError during class instantiation which could potentially halt execution if not handled properly.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of HDFSHook or HDFSHookException triggers RuntimeError with a deprecation message.",
  "anomalies": "Code is designed to always raise exceptions upon instantiation, which could be disruptive but not malicious. No external input or untrusted data handling observed. No hidden code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines deprecated classes that immediately raise RuntimeError with a deprecation and migration message when instantiated. The exception message guides users to migrate to newer hooks or downgrade dependencies. No malicious code, data leakage, or security risks are present. The immediate raising of errors is a design choice to enforce migration, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intentionally designed to prevent usage of deprecated classes by raising exceptions with instructions. There is no malicious intent or behavior. It serves as a deprecation enforcement mechanism. No security risks or malware detected.",
