  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions that raise exceptions upon instantiation, serving as deprecation notices.\n- No external data input, network activity, or data processing occurs.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The purpose is explicitly to inform users about deprecated classes and guide migration/downgrade procedures.\n- The immediate raising of exceptions in constructors is unusual but intentional for deprecation enforcement.\n- No malicious behavior, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores**\n\n**Malware Score:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that there is no malicious activity. The code does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, code injection, or other malicious actions.\n- The classes are designed to prevent use of deprecated features by raising exceptions, which is benign.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques such as encoding, dynamic code generation, or confusing constructs.\n- The consistent and clear purpose supports a score of 0.\n\n**Risk Score:**\n\n- The risk is essentially zero, as the code does not introduce vulnerabilities, backdoors, or security flaws.\n- The only potential concern is that raising exceptions during class instantiation could disrupt workflows if not handled properly, but this is a controlled, intentional design for deprecation, not a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Score Justification and Recommendations**\n\n| Report # | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk | Justification |\n|------------|---------|--------------|-------|--------------|\n| 1-5        | 0       | 0            | 0     | No malicious activity, no obfuscation, and the code serves a benign purpose of deprecation enforcement. The immediate exceptions are a deliberate design choice, not malicious. |\n\nThe scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Any discrepancies or points of concern?**\n\n- No. The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malware or security risks.\n- The use of exceptions to prevent usage is unusual but clearly intended for deprecation, not malicious intent.\n- The deprecation message is detailed and instructive, which is good practice.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment and recommended scores**\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**  \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, non-malicious deprecation enforcement mechanism. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, serves only to notify users about deprecated classes, and raises exceptions to enforce migration. No malicious or security issues are present.",
