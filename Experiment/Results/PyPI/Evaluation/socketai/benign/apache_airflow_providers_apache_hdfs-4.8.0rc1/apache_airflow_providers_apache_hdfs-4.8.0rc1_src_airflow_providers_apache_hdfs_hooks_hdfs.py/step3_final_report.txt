{
  "purpose": "This code defines deprecated classes for HDFS hooks that, upon instantiation, immediately raise RuntimeError with a deprecation message, guiding users to upgrade or downgrade their dependencies.",
  "sources": "Class constructors (__init__ methods) that raise exceptions immediately upon instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of the classes triggers the exception, preventing further execution or use of the deprecated classes.",
  "anomalies": "The classes are designed solely to raise exceptions for deprecation enforcement; no malicious or suspicious code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two classes, HDFSHook and HDFSHookException, both of which raise RuntimeError with a detailed message when instantiated. This pattern is used to prevent the use of deprecated classes and inform users to upgrade or downgrade their packages. There are no external inputs, network activities, or data processing. The code is static and straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. The immediate exception raising in constructors is unusual but intentional for deprecation enforcement. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. The purpose is purely informational and enforcement-oriented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a deprecation warning mechanism by preventing instantiation of outdated classes through exceptions. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with its benign nature.",
