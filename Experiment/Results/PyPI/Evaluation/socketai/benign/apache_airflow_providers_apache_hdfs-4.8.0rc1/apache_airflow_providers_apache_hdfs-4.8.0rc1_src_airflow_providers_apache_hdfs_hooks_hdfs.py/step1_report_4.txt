{
  "purpose": "The code defines deprecated and non-functional classes related to HDFS hooks for Apache Airflow, intended to inform users to upgrade or downgrade their packages.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code primarily defines classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; raises exceptions and defines classes.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of HDFSHook or HDFSHookException triggers RuntimeError with a message; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The classes are designed to immediately raise RuntimeError upon instantiation, which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for deprecated hooks that raise exceptions when instantiated, indicating they are placeholders or warnings for deprecated features. The exception messages guide users to upgrade or downgrade packages. There are no inputs, outputs, or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network connections, or code injection. The code appears to be a benign deprecation notice implemented via class design.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deprecation warning mechanism, with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply prevents use of outdated classes and instructs users accordingly. No malware or security threats are present.",
