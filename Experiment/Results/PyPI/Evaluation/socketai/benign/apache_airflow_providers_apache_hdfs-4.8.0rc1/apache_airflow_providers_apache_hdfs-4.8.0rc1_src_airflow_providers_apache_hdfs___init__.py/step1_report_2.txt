{
  "purpose": "The code sets version information and enforces a minimum version requirement for Apache Airflow.",
  "sources": "Reads the Airflow version from the airflow package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; only raises an exception based on version check.",
  "flows": "Reads airflow.__version__, compares with fixed version string, and potentially raises RuntimeError.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard version check and exception raising.",
  "analysis": "The code imports versioning tools, retrieves the current Airflow version, compares it to a minimum required version (2.9.0), and raises an error if the current version is lower. No input or external data sources beyond the imported modules. No suspicious or unusual behavior, no code injection or malicious logic present. The version comparison and exception are typical for dependency enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward version check and exception enforcement to ensure compatibility. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. The code is benign and typical for package version validation.",
