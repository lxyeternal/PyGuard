  "purpose": "Enforce minimum required version of apache-airflow for the provider package.",
  "sources": "Imports airflow.__version__ to retrieve current version.",
  "sinks": "Raises RuntimeError if version is below threshold, halting execution.",
  "flows": "Reads airflow.__version__, compares to '2.9.0', triggers exception if incompatible.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version check with no suspicious or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated dependency validation script. It imports the airflow version, compares it to a fixed minimum, and raises an exception if the current version is too low. No input sources beyond module imports, no data sinks for untrusted data, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior are present. The logic is clear, simple, and aligns with common dependency enforcement patterns. No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The exception halts execution on version mismatch, which is standard practice, not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs a standard version check, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is zero. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate; minor adjustments to the security risk score to zero are recommended for consistency.",
