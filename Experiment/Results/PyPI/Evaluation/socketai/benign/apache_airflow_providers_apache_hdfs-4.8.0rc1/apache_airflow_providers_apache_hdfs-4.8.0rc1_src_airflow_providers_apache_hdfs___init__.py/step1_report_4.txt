{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a package initialization or configuration file for an Apache Airflow provider, used for version checking and licensing information.",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__ attribute, importing the airflow package and its __version__ attribute, and reading the airflow_version variable.",
  "sinks": "The RuntimeError exception raising with version mismatch message, potential to halt execution if version requirements are not met.",
  "flows": "Code reads airflow version, compares it to a minimum required version, and raises an error if the condition is not satisfied.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. The code is standard for version validation and licensing comments. No hardcoded secrets or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of license comments, import statements, a version comparison check, and a runtime exception. It validates that the airflow version meets a minimum requirement. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or malicious logic is present. The version check is straightforward and based on trusted variables. No input/output flows beyond the initial version parsing and comparison. The code appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard version check and licensing header for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code is safe and solely for version validation.",
