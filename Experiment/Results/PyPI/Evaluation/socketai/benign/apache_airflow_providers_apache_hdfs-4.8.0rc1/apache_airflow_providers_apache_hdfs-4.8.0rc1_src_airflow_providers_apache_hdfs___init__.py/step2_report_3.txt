  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as an auto-generated, straightforward version check script for an Apache Airflow provider package.\n- The code reads the Airflow version, compares it to a minimum required version (2.9.0), and raises a RuntimeError if the version is too low.\n- No input sources other than the imported `airflow.__version__` are involved.\n- No sinks for untrusted data, no network activity, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- The code appears standard, with no suspicious or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code matches the description: it performs a version check, raises an error if the version is below 2.9.0, and is a typical auto-generated configuration script.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Are there any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The logic is straightforward, correct, and standard for dependency version enforcement. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0.0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0.0, which is correct. The code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  The scores are very low (mostly 0.0 or 0.1). Given the code's benign nature, these are reasonable. The minimal risk of halting execution if the version is incompatible is standard and not security-critical.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The only minor point is the `RuntimeError` which halts execution if the version is incompatible. However, this is a standard practice and not a security issue.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment, correctly identifying the code as benign, standard, and without malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Aspect            | Score (0-1) | Justification                                                                                     |\n|-------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0.0         | No malicious activity or code present.                                                         |\n| Obfuscated        | 0.0         | Clear, straightforward code.                                                                      |\n| Security Risk     | 0.0 - 0.1   | Very low; standard version check, no security vulnerabilities.                                |\n\n**My Reasoned Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — the code is purely for version enforcement.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 — minimal, related only to process halting, which is a benign control flow.\n\n---\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe code is a typical, safe, auto-generated dependency validation script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No malicious or obfuscated code detected.  \n- The version check is standard and safe.  \n- The security risk is negligible.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is benign, and the reported scores are accurate.",
