{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of an automatically generated Python module for an Apache Airflow provider, mainly handling version compatibility checks and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the imported modules, reading the `airflow_version` variable, and the version comparison logic.",
  "sinks": "Potential RuntimeError if version check fails, but this is a standard control flow, not a security sink.",
  "flows": "The code reads the airflow version, compares it, and may raise an exception based on the comparison result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs straightforward version checking with no suspicious or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, reads version info, and performs a version comparison. It raises an exception if the version is below a certain threshold, which is typical for dependency version enforcement. No input/output sources or sinks suggest data leaks or malicious activity. The code structure is clear and standard for such validation logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version compatibility check for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious instructions.",
