  "purpose": "This script appears to be an auto-generated module for an Apache Airflow provider, setting version compatibility and module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements (__future__, packaging.version, airflow.__version__), reading airflow version",
  "sinks": "Runtime version comparison and exception raising if version is below 2.9.0",
  "flows": "Import airflow.__version__ → parse version → compare with 2.9.0 → raise RuntimeError if incompatible",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; standard version check and exception handling. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a version string, and performs a version compatibility check. It raises an error if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0. No external inputs are handled other than reading the imported airflow version. The code is straightforward and follows standard patterns for compatibility checks. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are present. The license and comments indicate it's a standard, auto-generated file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version compatibility check for an Apache Airflow provider. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or obfuscation detected. The script simply enforces version constraints and manages exports.",
