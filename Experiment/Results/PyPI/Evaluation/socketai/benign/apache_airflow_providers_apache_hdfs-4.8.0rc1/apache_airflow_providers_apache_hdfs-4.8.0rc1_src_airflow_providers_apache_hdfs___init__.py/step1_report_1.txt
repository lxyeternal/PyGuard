{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a generated configuration or initialization script for an Apache Airflow provider package, mainly setting version constraints and imports.",
  "sources": "Reads the Airflow version from the airflow package (`from airflow import __version__`)",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output effects are evident",
  "flows": "The airflow version is imported and compared to a fixed string ('2.9.0'), leading to a RuntimeError if the version is too low",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is standard for version checking with a conditional error raising. It does not contain obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard, automatically generated file that imports airflow version info, compares it to a required minimum version, and raises an error if the condition is not met. It primarily enforces version compatibility. No input sources such as user input, environment variables, or network data are involved. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and intended for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, auto-generated configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It enforces version requirements for the package and contains no harmful or suspicious logic.",
