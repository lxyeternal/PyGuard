  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python namespace package extension using pkgutil.extend_path, supporting multiple directories for a package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and imports pkgutil to extend it.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input.",
  "flows": "The flow involves extending __path__ for namespace package support; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a common pattern for namespace packages with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is a typical namespace package extension pattern, with no embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The reports are empty with no detailed analysis or evidence. Given the lack of any suspicious activity or anomalies, the code appears benign. The reports do not provide any substantive information to suggest otherwise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard and safe; no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected. The reports are empty placeholders, providing no evidence of issues. Scores are set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
