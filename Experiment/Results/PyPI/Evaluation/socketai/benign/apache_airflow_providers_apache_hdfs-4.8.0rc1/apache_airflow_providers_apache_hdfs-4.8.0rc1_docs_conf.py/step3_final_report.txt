  "purpose": "Configure environment variable 'AIRFLOW_PACKAGE_NAME' and import all from 'docs.provider_conf' for documentation build setup.",
  "sources": "Sets environment variable 'AIRFLOW_PACKAGE_NAME'; imports everything from 'docs.provider_conf'.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable may influence downstream processes; import could introduce imported module's code into runtime.",
  "flows": "Environment variable assignment; import statement bringing in external module code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported symbols; no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward configuration: setting an environment variable and importing a module. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected. The use of 'import *' is typical in configuration scripts but can obscure namespace; however, it does not indicate malicious intent. The environment variable setting is explicit and benign. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.1) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The minimal risk stems from the import pattern and environment variable influence, which are standard practices in such scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration snippet with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
