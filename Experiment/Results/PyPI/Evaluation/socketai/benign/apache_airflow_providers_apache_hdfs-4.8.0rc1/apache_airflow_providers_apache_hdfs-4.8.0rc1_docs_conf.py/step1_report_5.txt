  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.environ), importing modules (from docs.provider_conf import *).",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable import * from external module, setting environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variable set -> imported module used in build process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of import * which can conceal imported names, setting environment variable that could influence downstream behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets an environment variable 'AIRFLOW_PACKAGE_NAME' to a specific string, which influences the build environment. It imports all contents from 'docs.provider_conf', which could introduce additional code, but the import itself is not inherently malicious. The code is straightforward, intended for configuration purposes. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious network activity are present. The import * is a potential concern for obscurity but not malicious. Overall, this code appears to be a typical configuration script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script setting an environment variable and importing a module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
