  "purpose": "This code serves as a module-level documentation and version indicator for the WebHelpers library.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, data, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist, as the code contains only a docstring and a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a descriptive docstring and a version variable assignment, with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and lack of executable content justify the low scores and high confidence in its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as documentation with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate given the code's minimal and descriptive nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
