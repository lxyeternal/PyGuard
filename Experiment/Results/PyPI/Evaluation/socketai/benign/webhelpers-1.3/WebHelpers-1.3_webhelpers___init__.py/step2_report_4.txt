  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and compare them with the provided code snippet.\n\n**Code review:**\nThe code consists solely of:\n- A docstring describing the WebHelpers library.\n- A version assignment: `__version__ = \"1.3\"`.\n\n**Assessment of the reports:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code contains only descriptive text and a version variable, with no input/output, data flows, or executable logic.\n   - There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code is benign and purely informational.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the minimal nature of the code.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated: 0`\n     - `malware: 0`\n     - `securityRisk: 0`\n     - `confidence: 1`\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0, which is correct.\n   - The code is purely documentation and version info, with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - Since there's no malicious activity, the malware score of 0 is justified.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, code execution, or data manipulation.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they treat the code as benign and purely informational.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's content.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n- The code is a simple module-level docstring and version variable, with no security issues.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's nature and the detailed analyses provided.\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary; the current scores and assessments are appropriate.",
