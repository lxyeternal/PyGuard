  "purpose": "Utility functions for extracting image dimensions from various formats, including JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, using header parsing or PIL.",
  "sources": "File I/O operations reading image headers, PIL's Image.open (if used).",
  "sinks": "File reading, parsing headers, no external communication or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reading image files -> header parsing or PIL image opening -> returning dimensions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import Image' without explicit 'from PIL import Image' (outdated but not malicious). No suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image size extraction via header parsing and PIL. No network activity, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets. The import statement is outdated but not malicious. The exception handling is appropriate. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for image dimension extraction. The security risk is minimal, with no malware or obfuscation detected. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
