{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for retrieving image dimensions using PIL or standard libraries, and includes a test script for batch processing image files.",
  "sources": "Reading image files from paths provided as function arguments or command-line inputs; opening files with open(), reading file headers.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent over the network or written to external systems; no untrusted data is used in a way that affects system security or leaks sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input image file paths -> open/read image files -> extract size info from headers -> output dimensions.",
  "anomalies": "None apparent; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The code performs straightforward file header parsing. The use of 'import Image' may be a potential issue depending on environment, but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to calculate proportional heights, extract image dimensions via PIL or header parsing, and includes a test routine for command-line usage. The functions perform standard file and header operations with no suspicious behaviors or external communications. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present. The reading and parsing of image headers are standard procedures for dimension extraction. The import 'Image' relies on PIL, which is a known external library, not suspicious. The script does not contain any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for obtaining image dimensions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on standard libraries and performs common tasks in image processing. There are no anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.",
