  "purpose": "Utility functions for obtaining image dimensions from various formats, supporting PIL and standard library methods.",
  "sources": "File input streams (open/read) for image files, environment variables are not used, no external data inputs other than file paths.",
  "sinks": "Image file reading operations, no data sinks that send data externally or to network, no user data processing.",
  "flows": "File path input -> file opening -> reading headers or image data -> extracting dimensions -> returning values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures; no hardcoded secrets; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution; usage of deprecated 'Image' import without module specification may indicate outdated code but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to calculate image dimensions from files using PIL or pure Python. The get_dimensions() function reads file headers to determine image size, handling JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP formats. It performs standard file operations and parsing without executing untrusted code or network communication. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is primarily for utility purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for image dimension extraction with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It operates within expected parameters, with standard file I/O and image format parsing. No security risks identified.",
