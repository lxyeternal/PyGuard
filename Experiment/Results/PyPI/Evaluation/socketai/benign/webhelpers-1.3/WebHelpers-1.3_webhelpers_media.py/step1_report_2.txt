  "purpose": "Provide multimedia helper functions for image dimension retrieval using PIL or standard library methods.",
  "sources": "Reading image files from the filesystem (os.path, open, read), importing Image module.",
  "sinks": "Image.open() in get_dimensions_pil, file reading in get_dimensions, reading file headers and seeking within files.",
  "flows": "Input file paths -> open/read file headers -> parse headers -> return dimensions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed. No suspicious network activity or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily provides functions to calculate image dimensions by inspecting image headers or using PIL. It imports modules like os, struct, sys, and a potentially outdated 'Image' module without explicit import validation, but this is typical for PIL. The code reads image files directly, parsing headers for JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP formats, and uses PIL for more accurate results if available. The script includes a test function that prints dimensions for provided files, with no suspicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or network activity is present. Overall, the code performs legitimate file processing without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for image dimension extraction. There are no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior, no suspicious network activity, or hardcoded secrets. It functions solely to read image headers or use PIL to obtain size info, and the structure and content are consistent with legitimate multimedia helper functions.",
