  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for obtaining image dimensions using PIL or standard library methods, and includes a command-line test function.",
  "sources": "Input is taken from image file paths provided via command-line arguments; file reads occur in get_dimensions().",
  "sinks": "No direct data leaks or dangerous operations; no untrusted data is written or transmitted. The only potential concern is file access.",
  "flows": "Input file paths flow into get_dimensions(), which reads image files to extract size data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscation or misleading constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions for calculating proportional height, extracting image dimensions via PIL or standard library. The get_dimensions() function reads image headers to identify format and extract size info, supporting JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP. It uses safe file operations with proper exception handling and cleanup. The test_get_dimensions() function processes command-line inputs and prints results, with no network or external dependencies involved. No suspicious code or malicious behavior detected; the code appears to be standard utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for image size retrieval with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It handles files safely and does not perform any harmful actions. The likelihood of malicious behavior is very low.",
