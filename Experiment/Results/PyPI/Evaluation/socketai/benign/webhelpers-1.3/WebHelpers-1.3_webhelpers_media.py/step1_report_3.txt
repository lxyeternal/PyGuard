{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for retrieving image dimensions using PIL or standard library methods, primarily for image processing tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads image files from specified paths, particularly in functions get_dimensions_pil and get_dimensions, which open and read image data to determine size.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of open() to read image files, and the unpacking of binary data with struct.unpack, which processes untrusted image files to extract metadata.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input file paths through open() and read() calls to the parsing logic that interprets image headers; no untrusted data is directly written or sent elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code relies on standard library modules and PIL, with straightforward image processing logic. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or system modifications are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads image files and extracts dimensions based on known image headers (JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP). It employs standard techniques for parsing image metadata without executing external commands or network operations. It does not include any malicious code or behaviors such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or hidden backdoors. Usage of the PIL library is standard for image processing tasks, and the code safely handles file operations with exception handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, and the code appears to be a legitimate utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign image dimension utility with no detectable malicious intent. It processes image files to extract metadata safely and does not contain any malicious or suspicious patterns.",
