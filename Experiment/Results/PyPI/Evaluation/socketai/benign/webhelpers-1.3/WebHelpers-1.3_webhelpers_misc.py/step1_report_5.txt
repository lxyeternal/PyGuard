  "purpose": "Helper functions for data processing, type conversion, class introspection, and exception handling in Python.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; code operates on passed parameters and internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; code primarily performs internal computations, conversions, and introspections.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve function arguments and internal iteration, with no untrusted data reaching critical system or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated 'types.ClassType' for Python 2 compatibility, but no malicious behavior or obfuscation present. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for 'all', 'any', 'no', counting true elements, type conversion, flattening nested iterables, class subclass extraction, custom exceptions, exception formatting, and warnings. It imports standard modules and contains no external input handling or network operations. No suspicious or malicious patterns identified. The presence of deprecated features reflects compatibility intent, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for Python programming with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is well-structured, transparent, and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
