  "conclusion": "The main security issue is the use of `os.popen` with untrusted `text` in `itex()`, which can be exploited for remote code execution. The code itself is not malicious or obfuscated, but the command injection vector warrants a high risk assessment. Scores should reflect this high severity, with malware around 0.8 and risk around 0.75. Implementing input sanitization or refactoring to avoid shell execution is strongly advised."
