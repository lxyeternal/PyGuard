  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the WebHelpers Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Import statements at the beginning, setup() function parameters, and package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes to files, executes untrusted code, or interacts with external inputs at runtime.",
  "flows": "N/A – no untrusted data flows are present; the script is static and primarily defines package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The use of try-except for imports is standard practice. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import setuptools, falling back to ez_setup if necessary, which is common in setup scripts. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points without any user input or external data handling. The dependencies and metadata are standard for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious elements.",
