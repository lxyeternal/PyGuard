  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for WebHelpers library.",
  "sources": "Imports setuptools or ez_setup fallback, package metadata, dependencies, entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration, no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward setup code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It uses a try-except block for importing setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and entry points. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. No external data or network activity is involved. The code is static and purely declarative, with no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. All signals indicate benign, standard package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 is acceptable but can be lowered to 0 for clarity, as the fallback import pattern is common and not risky.",
