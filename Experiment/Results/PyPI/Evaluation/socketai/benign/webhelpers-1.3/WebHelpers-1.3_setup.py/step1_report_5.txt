{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used for packaging and distributing the WebHelpers Python library.",
  "sources": "Imports setuptools, ez_setup, and reads package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No clear untrusted data sinks or external data transmissions; standard setup operations.",
  "flows": "Import statements and package configuration flow into the setup process; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard package setup code with conditional import and package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports setuptools or uses ez_setup to ensure setuptools is available, then defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and entry points for the package. All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, no external data leaks, and no suspicious behaviors detected. The dependencies and code structure are consistent with common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is typical for open-source Python projects to have similar setup files.",
