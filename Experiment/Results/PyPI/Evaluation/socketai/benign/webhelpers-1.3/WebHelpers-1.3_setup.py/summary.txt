  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 is acceptable but can be lowered to 0 for clarity, as the fallback import pattern is common and not risky."
