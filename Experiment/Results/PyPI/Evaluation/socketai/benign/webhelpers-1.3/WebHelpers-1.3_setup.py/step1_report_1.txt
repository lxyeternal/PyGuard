  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the WebHelpers Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools and ez_setup, package metadata, dependencies, entry points.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of setup parameters that could influence package installation or behavior, though none indicate malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Imports and package configuration flow: imports lead to setup configuration, which specifies dependencies and entry points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of try-except for imports is standard. No obfuscated or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations: imports necessary modules, defines version, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. The try-except block ensures compatibility if setuptools isn't initially available. Dependencies and classifiers are typical. No dynamic code execution or suspicious operations are present. The code does not perform any network, file, or system modifications; it solely defines package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It appears safe and normal for its intended purpose.",
