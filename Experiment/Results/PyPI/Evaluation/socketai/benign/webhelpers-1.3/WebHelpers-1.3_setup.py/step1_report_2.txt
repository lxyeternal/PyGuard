  "purpose": "Setup script for the WebHelpers Python package, handling installation, dependencies, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements at the beginning, package metadata, dependencies in 'install_requires' and 'tests_require', and setup() configuration.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution points in setup() function, such as installing packages and handling dependencies.",
  "flows": "Import statements -> setup() parameters -> package installation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Usage of standard setup utilities and dependency declarations. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup routine for a Python package using setuptools, with fallbacks for import errors. It defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and entry points. No untrusted input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior or malicious intent observed. The dependencies are standard and widely used. No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
