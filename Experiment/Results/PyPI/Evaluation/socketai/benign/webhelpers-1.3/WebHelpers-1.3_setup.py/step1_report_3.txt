{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python library called WebHelpers, including dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Imports at the beginning, package metadata, dependencies in install_requires and tests_require, entry_points section.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the import of external modules and execution of setup() with provided parameters, though no untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "Imports -> setup() call with static data -> installation dependencies and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or functions. The code appears to be a straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with conditional import statements to ensure setuptools is available, which is standard. The setup() function is called with static parameters defining package info, dependencies, and entry points. No dynamic or untrusted data sources are present. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code structure is typical for a Python package setup and does not involve any suspicious or obfuscated features.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It only defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points in a conventional manner.",
