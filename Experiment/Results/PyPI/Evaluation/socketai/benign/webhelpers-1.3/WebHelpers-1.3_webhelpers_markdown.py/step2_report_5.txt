  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core logic, potential vulnerabilities, and supply chain risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n- **Findings:** The script is a markdown parser with extension support. The main concern is unvalidated dynamic extension imports (`__import__(\"mdx_\" + ext)`), which could allow malicious extensions to execute arbitrary code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malware or obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Level:** Moderate (0.4). The extension import mechanism is the primary concern.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that dynamic extension loading via `__import__` without validation is a supply chain risk. If malicious extensions are supplied, they could execute arbitrary code. The core code itself appears benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing extension loading via dynamic import. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk Level:** Low (0.2). The core logic is safe; the main concern is extension import.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The core code is a legitimate markdown converter. The supply chain risk from unvalidated extension imports remains.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n- **Findings:** Focuses on the use of `__import__` with user-controlled extension names, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if malicious extensions are introduced.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk Level:** High (0.6). The dynamic import based on untrusted input is a significant supply chain concern.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrectly highlights the primary security concern: unvalidated dynamic extension import. This is a well-known supply chain vector. No active malware or obfuscation is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous, emphasizing extension loading, raw HTML handling, and DOM manipulation. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk Level:** Low (0.2).\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The core logic is benign, with the main risk again being extension loading if extensions are malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n- **Findings:** Focuses on extension loading, raw HTML handling, and overall safe processing. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk Level:** Low (0.2).\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrect. The core code is safe; the supply chain risk is primarily from external extensions.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation in the core script.\n- **Main Risk:** The dynamic extension import mechanism (`__import__(\"mdx_\" + ext)`) is the primary supply chain vector. If an attacker supplies a malicious extension name, arbitrary code could be executed.\n- **Other Points:** Handling of raw HTML blocks and inline patterns are standard for markdown parsers. No evidence of malicious behavior there.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — No active malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — Code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** **0.4** — Due to extension loading mechanism, which could be exploited if malicious extensions are supplied.\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n- The core code is a legitimate markdown parser with no malicious intent.\n- The supply chain risk stems from unvalidated dynamic extension imports.\n- Proper validation of extension names before import would mitigate this risk.\n- No hidden or malicious code segments are present.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is primarily safe, with a moderate supply chain risk associated with extension loading. No malware or obfuscation is present.",
