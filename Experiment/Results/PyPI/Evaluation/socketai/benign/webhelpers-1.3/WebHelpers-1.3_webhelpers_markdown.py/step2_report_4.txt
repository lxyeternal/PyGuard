  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the security implications, the presence of malicious code, and the consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a Markdown to HTML converter with extension support, extensive regex parsing, and raw HTML handling. No active malware detected; main concern is supply chain risk via extension loading.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk score:** 0.4 — moderate, due to unvalidated extension imports.\n- **Justification:** The dynamic import of extensions (`__import__(\"mdx_\" + ext)`) is a supply chain vector. If malicious extensions are supplied, they could execute harmful code. No code injection or backdoors are present in core logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly rated as low malware, moderate risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing extension support, regex parsing, and no malicious behavior. Dynamic extension import is a potential supply chain concern.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, given the benign core.\n- **Justification:** Same as above; no active malware, but extension import mechanism is a supply chain vector.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly rated.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights dynamic import via `__import__` based on user input, potential for arbitrary code execution if malicious extensions are supplied. No other malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no direct malware, but supply chain risk is high.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.6 — high, due to unvalidated dynamic import.\n- **Justification:** The dynamic import based on user-controlled extension names (`\"mdx_\" + ext`) is a significant supply chain attack vector. If a malicious extension is provided, it could execute arbitrary code.\n- **Conclusion:** The high risk score is justified; malware remains 0 but supply chain risk is high.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes a robust Markdown parser with raw HTML handling, placeholders, and extension support. No malicious activity detected; core logic appears safe.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to raw HTML handling and extension loading.\n- **Justification:** Handling raw HTML and extension loading is standard; risks depend on extensions, but core code is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, emphasizing safe processing, no malicious code, and extension support.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Justification:** No malicious code, just extension support and processing logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Scores:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.4          | Extension import risk |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.2          | Same as above |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.6          | High supply chain risk via dynamic import |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.2          | Safe core, extension risk only |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.2          | Same as above |\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code detected in core logic.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the supply chain risk via dynamic extension import, **0.6** for report 3 is justified, while others remain low.\n\n**Note:** The main concern is the extension loading mechanism. If malicious extensions are supplied externally, they could execute arbitrary code, but the core code itself is not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a well-structured Markdown parser with extension support. No active malware or sabotage is present. The supply chain risk via unvalidated extension import is the primary concern, warranting a higher risk score for that aspect. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set at 0.",
