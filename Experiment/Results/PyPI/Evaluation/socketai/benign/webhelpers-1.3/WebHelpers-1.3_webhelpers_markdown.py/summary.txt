  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured Markdown parser with no active malicious behavior. The primary security risk is the unvalidated dynamic import of extension modules, which could be exploited if malicious extensions are supplied. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score should be set to 0.5 to reflect the supply chain concern."
