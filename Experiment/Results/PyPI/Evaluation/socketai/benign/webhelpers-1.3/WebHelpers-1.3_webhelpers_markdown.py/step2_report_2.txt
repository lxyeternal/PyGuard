  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the logical consistency, potential security implications, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The core logic is a Markdown to HTML converter with extension support. The primary concern is unvalidated dynamic extension imports (`__import__`), which could allow malicious extensions to execute arbitrary code.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The report correctly identifies the dynamic import as a supply chain risk.\n  - No malicious code or backdoors are present within the core code.\n  - The risk score of **0.4** seems reasonable given the potential for malicious extensions.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of embedded malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The core logic is benign; the main risk is external extension supply chain attack.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing extension loading via dynamic import, with no malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The report emphasizes that the code is a legitimate Markdown processor.\n  - The malware score is 0, which is appropriate.\n  - The security risk score of 0.2 is slightly lower than Report 1, reflecting confidence that core code is safe but extension loading remains a concern.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the potential risk of dynamic import (`__import__`) based on user input, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if malicious extensions are supplied.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Correctly identifies the supply chain risk.\n  - No embedded malware.\n  - The risk score of **0.6** is appropriate, given the high potential impact if malicious extensions are introduced.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes the code as a comprehensive Markdown parser with raw HTML handling, DOM-like structures, and extension support. No malicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The report correctly notes that raw HTML and extension mechanisms could be exploited if input or extensions are malicious, but no such malicious activity is embedded.\n  - Malware score: 0, appropriate.\n  - Risk score: 0.2 is reasonable, considering potential risks if raw HTML is untrusted.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing that the core code does not perform malicious activities, and risks are primarily from external extensions.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Correctly states that the core logic is safe.\n  - No obfuscation or malware.\n  - Risk score: 0.2 is suitable.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0; no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports agree on 0; code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Most reports suggest 0.2–0.6, primarily due to extension loading risks.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malware or malicious code present.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is transparent and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** **0.3** — moderate, mainly due to unvalidated dynamic extension imports which could be exploited if malicious extensions are supplied.\n\n**Rationale:** The core code is a standard, well-structured Markdown processor. The main concern is supply chain risk associated with dynamic extension imports. If such extensions are trusted, the risk diminishes; if malicious extensions are introduced, they could execute arbitrary code. No embedded malware or obfuscation is present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious code detected.                                |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Code is clear, no obfuscation present.                     |\n| Risk             | 0.3               | Due to potential supply chain attack via unvalidated extensions. |\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to adjust the scores further or provide additional analysis.",
