  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard Python API client for HelloSign, handling SSL, proxies, and request construction. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. The low security risk score aligns with this. The malware score is correctly zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a typical HTTP client with SSL, proxy, and request handling. No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard HTTP client with SSL and proxy configurations, no malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is valid; the code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard SDK HTTP client, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a typical HTTP client, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the detailed reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is a standard, benign HTTP client SDK component.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are zero, which is appropriate given the analysis. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident.\n- **Security Risk Scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), but all are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or covert channels.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation or code hiding techniques.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — Slightly above zero, but justified due to network communication; however, the code's purpose is legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — The code is a straightforward HTTP client SDK.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Minimal, primarily due to network interactions, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the code is secure, legitimate, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.",
