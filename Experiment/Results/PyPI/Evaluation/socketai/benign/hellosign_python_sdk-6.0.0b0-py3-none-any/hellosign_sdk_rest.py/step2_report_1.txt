  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a Python SDK component for interacting with the HelloSign API.\n- It manages HTTP requests with SSL, proxy bypass, and error handling.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The code employs standard libraries and practices for HTTP communication.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- **Code Content:** The code is a typical implementation of an HTTP client, with no hidden or malicious logic.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Scores are consistently 0 across all reports.\n- **Potential Security Risks:** Low, as the code adheres to standard secure practices.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No apparent logical flaws or mistakes are present.\n- The code performs input validation, error handling, and SSL configuration appropriately.\n- Proxy bypass logic uses standard IP and hostname validation.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** Correctly set to 0; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly set to 0; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign low scores (~0.1-0.2), which seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n### Potential Concerns or Assumptions:\n- The only possible concern is that untrusted data (headers, URL, body) could be sent over the network, but this is expected for an API client. Proper validation or sanitization isn't explicitly shown but isn't necessarily required here.\n- Proxy bypass logic is standard; no vulnerabilities are apparent.\n\n### Consistency & Justification:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, obfuscation, or high security risk.\n- The code's purpose is clear, and it follows best practices.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, typical for an SDK component)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, legitimate API client implementation with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- No modifications needed for scores.\n- It functions as a typical, secure HTTP client for API interaction.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores; they accurately reflect the code's security posture.",
