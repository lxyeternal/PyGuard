{
  "purpose": "This code implements an HTTP client for the HelloSign API, managing SSL, proxies, and request handling.",
  "sources": "Input data includes URL, headers, query parameters, request body, and post parameters.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow into HTTP request bodies, headers, and URL parameters, potentially affecting network communication.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user-provided headers, body, or URL parameters flow into the request method, which constructs and sends HTTP requests, with responses processed accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Proxy bypass logic and SSL configuration are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured HTTP client using urllib3, with proper SSL, proxy, and error handling. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. It manages request construction securely, with validation on input parameters. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or covert channels are evident. The request flow and response handling follow best practices, and no suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign HTTP client SDK component with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is low (~0.1), consistent with its purpose. No modifications are necessary.",
