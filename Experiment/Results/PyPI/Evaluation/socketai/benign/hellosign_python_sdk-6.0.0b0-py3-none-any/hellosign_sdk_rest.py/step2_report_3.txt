  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client with SSL, proxy, and request handling. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent. The logic is sound, and no suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a typical HTTP client with standard features.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** No issues. The code's purpose and behavior are typical for an SDK component.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, describes a standard HTTP client with SSL and proxy configurations.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; the logic is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the standard nature.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights standard request handling, SSL, and proxy logic.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is a typical SDK HTTP client, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Logical flaws or mistakes:** No evident logical errors or security flaws that could be exploited maliciously.\n- **Scores consistency:** All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate. Risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The code handles untrusted input in request parameters, but this is standard for an SDK. Proper validation or sanitization is not within the scope here, but nothing indicates malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code detected.\n- **Malware justification:** The code does not perform any malicious actions—no data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign analysis, a slightly higher but still low score like **0.1** is appropriate, mainly due to network communication, which is expected for an SDK.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0.1** |\n\nThis aligns with the overall assessment that the code is a standard, secure API client with no malicious behavior.",
