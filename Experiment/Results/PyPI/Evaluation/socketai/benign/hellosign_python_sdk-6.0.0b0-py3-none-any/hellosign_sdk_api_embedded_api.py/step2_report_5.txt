  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correctly describes the code as a Python SDK for HelloSign embedded API, using method parameters for API requests.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: Properly identifies that data flows from parameters into API calls and responses are deserialized.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code is auto-generated, typical SDK code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: Reasonable conclusion; high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0 aligns with no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2 is appropriate given the benign nature but acknowledging potential API security concerns.\n\n**Assessment**: The report's reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Accurately describes the code as a client for embedded signing URLs, with standard parameter usage.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: Correctly notes that data flows into API requests and responses are handled properly.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No suspicious behavior or obfuscation. The code is standard SDK code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: Well-justified, high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2 is reasonable; no evident security risk.\n\n**Assessment**: The reasoning is valid, and the scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correctly states the code as an API wrapper for embedded URLs.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: Standard API request/response pattern, no malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors. Error handling is typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: Justified, high confidence (0.95). Malware score 0 aligns.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 is appropriate, indicating minimal security concern.\n\n**Assessment**: Well-reasoned, scores consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correctly describes the code as a client for embedded features.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: API requests and responses are handled securely.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No malicious patterns; standard SDK code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: Justified, high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0 is correct.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n**Assessment**: The reasoning is solid, scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Accurately states the code as a client for HelloSign embedded URLs.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: Correctly identifies data flow into API calls and response deserialization.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: Notes that 're' and 'sys' modules are imported but unused, which is benign but unnecessary. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: Well-justified, high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2 is suitable.\n\n**Assessment**: The reasoning is sound; the unnecessary imports are minor and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores**: All are 0, consistent with the analysis. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores**: All are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores**: Ranging from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low security risk, which is appropriate given the benign SDK code.\n\n### Final Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware**: 0 across all reports — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — code is straightforward, auto-generated SDK.\n- **Risk**: 0.1–0.2 — minimal security risk, mainly related to external API interactions, which are standard.\n\n**Summary**: The reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and the scores are justified. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion**: The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK for HelloSign's embedded API, with no malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk features detected.",
