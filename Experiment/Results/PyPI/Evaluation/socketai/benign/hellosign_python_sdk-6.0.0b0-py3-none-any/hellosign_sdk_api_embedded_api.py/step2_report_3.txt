  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a Python SDK for HelloSign embedded API, using method parameters to build requests.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurately states that data flows into API calls and responses are deserialized.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code is standard for an SDK, with proper error handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, with high confidence (0.9). Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is low (0.2).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No issues found. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a client for embedded signing/edit URLs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly describes data flow through API requests and response handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation. The code is typical SDK code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Consistent, high confidence (0.9). Malware and obfuscated scores are 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No security concerns or malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as a wrapper for embedded URLs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes request construction and response processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation. Error handling is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well justified, high confidence (0.95). Malware and obfuscated scores are 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code as a client for HelloSign embedded features.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly describes data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or obfuscation. Mentions that API keys are managed externally, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified, high confidence (0.9). Malware and obfuscated scores are 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as an SDK client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes request and response handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Points out that 're' and 'sys' modules are imported but unused—benign but unnecessary. No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well reasoned, high confidence (0.9). Malware and obfuscated scores are 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate; the unused imports are minor but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code appears straightforward, auto-generated SDK code without obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher than 0.2 in some reports, but justified given the code's nature. The code interacts with external services but does not perform any risky operations internally.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK client for HelloSign's embedded API.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The error handling, response deserialization, and request construction follow typical patterns.\n- The only minor note is the presence of unused imports ('re', 'sys') in report 5, which is benign.\n\n**Recommended scores:**\n\n| Aspect             | Score (0 to 1) | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0              | No malicious behavior detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated         | 0              | Code is straightforward, auto-generated SDK.                |\n| Security Risk      | 0.1 - 0.2      | Minimal risk; standard API client. No external threats.    |\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated features.  \n- The risk score could be set around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting typical SDK interaction with external services but no internal vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the consistency across all reports and the code review, I concur with the assessments that this code is benign and functions as intended for API interaction without security concerns.",
