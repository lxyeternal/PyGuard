{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python client SDK for interacting with the HelloSign embedded API, allowing users to generate embedded URLs for editing templates and signing documents.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include method parameters 'template_id', 'embedded_edit_url_request', and 'signature_id', which are used to construct API requests.",
  "sinks": "Data sinks are the API request execution functions, particularly 'call_with_http_info' in endpoints, which send requests to the HelloSign API server, and the deserialization of responses which may process API responses.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed to endpoint methods, which prepare request data. The request is sent via 'call_with_http_info', and responses are deserialized. Error handling interprets API responses, deserializing error or success data accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code primarily performs API request preparation, response handling, and error processing. The use of 'MetaDict' for response deserialization appears standard. No suspicious or unusual logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated API client SDK with typical structure: class encapsulating API endpoints, methods for specific API calls, parameter handling, and error management. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, such as dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The exception handling attempts to deserialize API errors properly. No suspicious network connections, secret data handling, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, auto-generated API client SDK with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It facilitates interaction with HelloSign's embedded document signing features without any signs of malicious or sabotage behavior.",
