{
  "purpose": "The code provides an API client wrapper for interacting with HelloSign's embedded document editing and signing URLs, enabling integration with their API services.",
  "sources": "User provides 'template_id' and 'signature_id' inputs, which are used to construct API requests. These are passed as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "API requests are sent via 'call_with_http_info'. Response data is deserialized, but no untrusted data is directly written or executed. The code handles API responses and errors.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('template_id', 'signature_id', request objects) flow into API request calls. Responses or errors flow back and are processed for deserialization and exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments observed. The code strictly follows standard API client patterns, including error handling. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated API wrapper for HelloSign's embedded URLs, with standard request construction, error handling, and response deserialization. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors is evident. The exception handling specifically deserializes error responses, and the API credentials are managed externally. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscated code features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard API client wrapper with no indications of malicious behavior. It securely manages API interactions and error handling. No security risks or malware signals are detected.",
