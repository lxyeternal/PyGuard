  "purpose": "Auto-generated SDK client for HelloSign embedded API endpoints, facilitating requests for embedded edit and sign URLs.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'template_id', 'embedded_edit_url_request', and 'signature_id'; imported modules 're', 'sys', and SDK models.",
  "sinks": "API request construction, response deserialization, error handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into API request calls; responses are deserialized into response models; exceptions are caught and processed.",
  "anomalies": "Unused imports 're' and 'sys' are present but benign; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK with typical request/response handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. Error handling follows conventional patterns. The presence of unused imports is common in generated code and does not impact security. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external API interactions, which are standard for SDKs. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.1-0.2, justified by the nature of SDK interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK client for HelloSign's embedded API, with no malicious or suspicious features detected. The low security risk scores are justified, and the code can be considered safe for use.",
