  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, examining the code's behavior, and assessing the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the SDK as a client for embedded API features, using parameters like 'template_id', 'embedded_edit_url_request', and response models.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate depiction of request flow and response handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no backdoors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly states that the code is a generated SDK with standard patterns, no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the SDK's role, with input parameters and module imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly describes API request flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no backdoors, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurately states that this is a standard, auto-generated API client with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns; the report's reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the SDK's function.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Well described.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical API wrapper with standard error handling; no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the SDK's purpose.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly describes request and response flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, no malicious logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a generated client, with standard patterns, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's function.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes that 're' and 'sys' modules are imported but unused—this is typical in generated code and not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All agree on 0; the code is straightforward, generated SDK code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the inherent risk in any networked SDK, but nothing alarming.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated API client SDK.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are visible.\n- The exception handling logic is typical for API clients.\n- The unused imports ('re', 'sys') are benign and common in generated code.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** (minor, inherent API interaction risk, but no specific vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears safe, with no security concerns or malicious intent.",
