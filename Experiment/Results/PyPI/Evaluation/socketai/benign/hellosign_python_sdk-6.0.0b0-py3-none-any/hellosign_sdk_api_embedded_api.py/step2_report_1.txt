  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details of the code, potential security issues, and the reasoning behind their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a generated SDK for HelloSign embedded API, with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard SDK code, with proper error handling and no suspicious logic.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's evaluation appears accurate. The low security risk score (0.2) is reasonable given the code's function.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API client behavior, no malicious activity, and no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No signs of malicious intent or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical API wrapper with standard request/response handling, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.95\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score reflects the absence of suspicious activity. The reasoning is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The evaluation is reasonable and well-justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a client interface with standard patterns, no malicious activity, but notes that API keys or secrets might be a concern outside this snippet.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The mention of external security measures (like API key management) is valid, but within this code, no issues are visible.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, noting the code is a standard SDK with no malicious patterns, but mentions unnecessary imports ('re', 'sys').\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The observation about unused imports is correct but does not impact security. No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The analysis is consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified. No malicious code, network exfiltration, or backdoors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, matching the clear, generated SDK code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly around 0.1-0.2, which is appropriate for SDK code that interacts with external APIs but does not pose inherent security risks.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and generated, no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1-0.2** — minimal, primarily due to external API interactions, which are standard for SDKs.\n\n**Note:** The only potential concern outside this code snippet is proper handling of API keys and secrets, which is outside the scope of this code review but should be managed securely in deployment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, auto-generated SDK client for HelloSign's embedded API endpoints. It exhibits no malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious patterns. The low security risk scores are justified, and the overall security posture based on this code is very strong.",
