  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the logical consistency of their assessments, the presence of malicious or suspicious code, and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a generated SDK for HelloSign embedded API, with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's reasoning aligns with the code review. The code is standard SDK code with typical request/response handling. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are present. The security risk score is low, reflecting minimal concern, which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API client patterns, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the previous report. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious logic. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard API wrapper with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe slightly lower security risk score (0.1) and higher confidence are justified, given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing standard API request/response handling, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical SDK client with no malicious activity. Notes that 're' and 'sys' modules are imported but unused, which is benign but unnecessary.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe mention of unused imports is accurate; it doesn't imply malicious intent. The overall conclusion remains sound.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, and the code is clearly readable, generated SDK code.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation, mostly around 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal concern, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9-0.95), justified by the straightforward analysis.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- No evidence of code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors.\n- The code interacts with external APIs securely, with no embedded secrets or malicious payloads.\n- The imports are standard, with a note about unused modules, which is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and generated)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, due to the nature of SDK code; no vulnerabilities detected)\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' assessments.** The code is a standard API client SDK with no security concerns or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Estimated Score |\n|--------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated         | 0                     |\n| Security Risk      | 0.1 – 0.2             |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score is appropriate, given the context.",
