  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose:** Standard API client wrapper for HelloSign bulk send jobs.  \n- **Sources/Sinks:** Reads input parameters, sends HTTP requests, deserializes responses.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis:** Typical generated code, proper error handling, no malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Very low security risk, no malware, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (possibly conservative but acceptable).\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, a client for HelloSign API.  \n- **Sources/Sinks:** Reads parameters, makes API calls, deserializes responses.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard generated code, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malware or security issues.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as above, client for bulk send jobs.  \n- **Sources/Sinks:** Inputs to API requests, deserializes responses.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis:** Typical API client, no malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (again, conservative).\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose:** Similar client wrapper, handling inputs and API calls.  \n- **Sources/Sinks:** Inputs to API, deserialization of responses.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard, generated code, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:** Very low security risk, no malware.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as others, auto-generated API wrapper.  \n- **Sources/Sinks:** Inputs, API calls, response handling.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis:** Typical boilerplate code, no malicious intent.  \n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or sabotage.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious code.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and generated.  \n- **Risk score:** Very low, given the nature of the code and lack of vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is clear and generated.  \n- **Risk:** Given the low complexity and lack of vulnerabilities, a risk score of 0.1 to 0.2 is appropriate. The existing scores of 0.2 and 0.1 are reasonable.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (consistent with current assessments)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, auto-generated API client wrapper with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The scores assigned are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final note:** Continue monitoring for any future updates or modifications, but based on the current static code analysis, the security posture is very low risk.",
