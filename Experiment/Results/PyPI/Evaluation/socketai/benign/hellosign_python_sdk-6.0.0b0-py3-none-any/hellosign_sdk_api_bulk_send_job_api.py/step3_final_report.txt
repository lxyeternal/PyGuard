  "purpose": "Generated Python client for HelloSign bulk send jobs API, facilitating retrieval and listing of bulk send jobs.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as 'bulk_send_job_id', 'page', 'page_size'; API request construction; response deserialization.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to API endpoints; response data deserialization into model objects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> API request -> API response -> deserialization into response models.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated API client wrapper with proper error handling and request management. It does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. Response handling and exception management follow best practices. No suspicious patterns or hidden mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe, and typical generated API client with no signs of sabotage, malware, or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified by its nature as a standard API wrapper, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent evident.",
