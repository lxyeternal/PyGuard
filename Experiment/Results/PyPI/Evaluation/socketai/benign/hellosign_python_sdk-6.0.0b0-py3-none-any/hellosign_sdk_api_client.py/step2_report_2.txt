  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard API client, with data from function parameters and environment/configuration.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests, file reads, deserialization—typical for API clients.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, proper file handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, auto-generated, with no malicious behavior. No signs of backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (low).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. The risk score of 0.1 seems reasonable given the standard nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard API client, with inputs from parameters and files.\n- **Sinks:** Network transmission, response deserialization, file handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscated parts, proper resource management.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent or sabotage detected. The code is typical of autogenerated SDKs.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. Slightly higher risk score (0.2) may reflect a cautious stance but remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard request construction, input validation, and serialization.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests, file reads, response deserialization.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, proper handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity or backdoors. Typical SDK behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion matches the code's behavior. The risk score is appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, with request and response handling.\n- **Sinks:** Network, files, headers.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, proper resource management.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. The risk score remains low, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard API client, with inputs from parameters, environment, files.\n- **Sinks:** Network, file uploads, response deserialization.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; code is standard SDK.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound, and the low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate 0, and the code contains no suspicious or malicious constructs. The code is a typical autogenerated SDK for API interaction.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0, which is accurate given the straightforward, clear structure.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern, primarily due to the nature of the code being an SDK.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with a legitimate SDK.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and justified. The code appears safe, with no supply chain or security risks evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, auto-generated API client for HelloSign with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned are reasonable and aligned with the code's behavior.",
