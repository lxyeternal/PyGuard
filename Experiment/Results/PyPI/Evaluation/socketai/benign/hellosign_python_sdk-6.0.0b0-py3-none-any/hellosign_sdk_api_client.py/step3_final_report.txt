{
  "purpose": "This code implements a generic, auto-generated API client for the HelloSign SDK, handling request construction, serialization, deserialization, threading, and authentication.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to methods, environment variables (via configuration), and file objects read during file uploads.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to API endpoints, file reads, response deserialization, and resource cleanup.",
  "flows": "Input data from parameters or files flows through serialization, request assembly, network transmission, and response deserialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network domains, no backdoors or malicious payloads observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK component with proper resource management (closing files), standard request handling, and no signs of malicious behavior. It uses common patterns for API interaction, with no embedded secrets or obfuscated logic. The request flow is straightforward, and the code structure aligns with typical SDKs, indicating low risk of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated API client with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It handles resources properly and follows standard patterns. The security risk is minimal, and there are no signs of supply chain compromise.",
