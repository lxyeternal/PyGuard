  "purpose": "Auto-generated SDK client wrapper for HelloSign's report creation API, facilitating request construction, response handling, and error processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'report_create_request' and network request to '/report/create' endpoint.",
  "sinks": "Deserialization of responses and error handling, with potential data flow over network; no direct data leaks or malicious sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input 'report_create_request' flows into request serialization, sent over HTTP, with responses deserialized into appropriate models; error responses also deserialized.",
  "anomalies": "Unused imports 're' and 'sys' are present but harmless; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated API client with no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. Exception handling deserializes error responses appropriately. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal risk stems from external data transmission, typical for SDKs, and is reflected in low risk scores. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's benign and straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated SDK wrapper with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk is appropriate given its function. Scores are accurate and do not require modification.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
