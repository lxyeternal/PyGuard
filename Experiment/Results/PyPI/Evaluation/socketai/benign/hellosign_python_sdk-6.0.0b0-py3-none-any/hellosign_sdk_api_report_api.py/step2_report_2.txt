  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a standard auto-generated API client wrapper; no malicious or suspicious code detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified; the code follows typical patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0.2 seems slightly high but acceptable considering it interfaces with external services.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets. The risk score could be lowered to 0.1 for a more conservative estimate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; standard autogenerated SDK code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Similar reasoning applies.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior; risk score could be decreased slightly.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; standard API client code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2. The current score seems reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, just request handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code imports 're' and 'sys' but does not use them. These are benign but unnecessary.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Minor code smell due to unused imports, but not security relevant.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent; the unused imports are harmless but could be cleaned up.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; standard API client code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2. The current score is reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and generated.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly conservative at 0.1-0.2; given the code's benign nature, I would recommend lowering the risk score to **0.1** for all reports to reflect minimal security concern.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- The code is a typical, auto-generated SDK client for an external API.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected.\n- The current scores are reasonable but could be slightly lowered to reflect the benign nature.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the thorough analysis and the nature of the code.",
