{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling errors in the HelloSign API client, including type, value, attribute, key, and HTTP response errors.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily defines exception classes and a utility function, with no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no security-sensitive sinks such as network calls, file operations, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations; the code only raises and formats exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard exception class definitions with no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception handling classes for API error management, with a utility to render exception paths. It includes detailed messages and error handling mechanisms, but no code executes external commands, accesses sensitive data, or performs network operations. The classes are straightforward and typical for an API client. No anomalies, malicious behavior, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard error handling scaffolding for an API client library. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The overall security risk is minimal.",
