  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Code Content Summary:**\n- The code defines custom exception classes for handling API errors.\n- Includes a utility function `render_path` for formatting error paths.\n- No data processing, network calls, or external data manipulation.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- The code appears to be a standard part of an SDK's error handling mechanism.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Defines exception classes and a utility function.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious behavior; standard exception handling.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0, confidence 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, exception classes for error handling.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No external data, no malicious code, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0, confidence 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, exception classes, path rendering.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious intent, no external interactions.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0, confidence 1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Exception classes and string rendering.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, no external dependencies or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0, confidence 1.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Exception classes, error handling, path rendering.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no external data or network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.1, confidence 0.9.\n- **Observation:** The security risk score is slightly above zero, but given the benign nature, this is likely an overestimation.\n- **Verdict:** The low risk score is justified, but perhaps a 0.0 would be more accurate given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identified as 0. No malicious behavior present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0 or very close to 0, reflecting minimal security risk.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security vulnerabilities or risks evident)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent with the code. The code is a standard, safe implementation of exception handling classes for an API SDK, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The slight elevation in risk score in report 5 could be lowered to 0, but overall, the scoring aligns well with the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.",
