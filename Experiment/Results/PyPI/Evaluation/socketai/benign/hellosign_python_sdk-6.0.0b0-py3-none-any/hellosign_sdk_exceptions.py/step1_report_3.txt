  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling API-related errors in the HelloSign OpenAPI client.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; exception handling based on internal error conditions.",
  "sinks": "Error messages formatted and possibly logged or displayed, but no untrusted data execution or leak occurs.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised and formatted for debugging or user information, no untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic present. The code is straightforward exception class definitions and a utility function.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard Python exception subclasses and a helper function for rendering error paths. It handles exception creation, message formatting, and output, with no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The rendering function creates string representations of paths, which is benign. No external calls, network operations, or data manipulations that could be malicious are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception classes for API error handling with a helper for path rendering. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code. It is safe and typical for API client implementations.",
