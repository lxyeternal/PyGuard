  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for API error handling and a utility function for rendering error paths.",
  "sources": "Error message strings, path_to_item list used in exception classes",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "Error messages constructed from input data, no external data flow or network activity",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward exception classes and utility function with no suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception classes and a helper function for formatting error paths. There are no data processing, network calls, or external dependencies. The code is standard for SDK error handling, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the original reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk near zero) are consistent with the benign nature of this code. The only minor discrepancy is in one report assigning a risk score of 0.1, which can be considered an overestimation given the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of exception classes for an API SDK, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The original reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and accurate. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
