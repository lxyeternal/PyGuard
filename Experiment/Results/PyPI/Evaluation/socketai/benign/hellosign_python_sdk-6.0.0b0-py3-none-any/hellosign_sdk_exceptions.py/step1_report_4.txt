{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various API error conditions in a client library for HelloSign's API.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily defines classes and functions for exception handling and string rendering.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no places where untrusted data is used in a manner that affects system security, such as executing code or handling user input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process input data or flow data from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward exception class definitions with string formatting for error messages. The render_path function creates a string representation of a list of path components.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of exception class definitions for API error handling, including custom messages and formatting. No input parsing, data processing, or external interactions are present. There are no signs of malicious logic, code injection, data leakage, or other security risks. The only functions are for creating exception objects with formatted error messages, which are standard for SDKs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for exception handling and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard part of an API client library. No malicious intent or security concerns are evident.",
