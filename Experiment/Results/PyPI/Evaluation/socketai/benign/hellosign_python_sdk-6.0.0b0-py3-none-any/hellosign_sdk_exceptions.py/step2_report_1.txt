  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the scoring, and the reasoning.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code consists solely of custom exception classes and a utility function (`render_path`) for formatting error paths.\n- No data processing, network communication, or external data handling occurs.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of this code.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Review**\n\n#### **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n- **Confirmed:** The code matches the description; it defines exception classes and a helper function. No issues or malicious code are present.\n\n#### **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**\n- **Observation:** All reports correctly identify that the code is standard, straightforward, and safe.\n- **No flaws or mistakes** are evident in the reasoning or summaries.\n\n#### **Scores and Justifications**\n- **Malware Score (all reports):** 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk:** Near zero, as no external data, secrets, or external calls are involved.\n- **Confidence levels:** Mostly 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n#### **Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores**\n- **No discrepancies** observed. All scores align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Challenging Assumptions & Additional Insights**\n- The reports assume no malicious intent, which is consistent with the code.\n- The only potential concern could be if this code were injected maliciously into a supply chain, but the code itself is safe.\n- The `render_path` function is benign; it only formats list elements into a string.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, as it's purely for error handling)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Recommendations**\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of exception classes for an API SDK.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the fact that, in supply chain context, even benign code can be a vector if injected maliciously, but as an isolated code review, this is minimal)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate. No further action needed.",
