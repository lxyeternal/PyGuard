{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and a utility function for handling API errors in the HelloSign SDK.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the HTTP response object passed to ApiException, and optional path_to_item parameters in exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "Error messages generated from exception objects; these are primarily string messages, not data sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from HTTP responses into exception constructors, which generate error messages; no data is processed or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code consists solely of exception class definitions and a straightforward utility function.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for handling API errors, including a utility function to render data paths into strings. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or data leakage. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed. The exception classes are typical for error handling in API client libraries. The render_path function is a simple helper for formatting error paths. Overall, the code is clean, standard, and appears to be safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign part of an API SDK with no malicious intent or security risks. It primarily manages error handling with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior.",
