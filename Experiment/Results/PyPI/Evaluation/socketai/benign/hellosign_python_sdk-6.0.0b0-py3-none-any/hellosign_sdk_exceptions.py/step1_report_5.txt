{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling API errors and related operations in the HelloSign API client.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code defines classes and functions for error handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; it only defines exception handling mechanisms.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present. The code is purely for error handling and string rendering.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions, with additional context handling via path information. The render_path function creates string representations of paths, used in exception messages. No input/output operations, external network calls, or data manipulations are present. The code appears to be a straightforward error handling framework for an API client, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, well-structured exception handling classes with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not process untrusted data or perform external communications, indicating a low likelihood of malicious activity.",
