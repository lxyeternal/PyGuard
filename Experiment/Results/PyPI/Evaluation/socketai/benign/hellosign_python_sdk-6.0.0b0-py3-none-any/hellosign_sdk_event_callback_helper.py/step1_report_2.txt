{
  "purpose": "To verify the authenticity of callback events from HelloSign by checking a hash signature.",
  "sources": "The function reads the api_key and event object, specifically accessing event.event_time, event.event_type, and event.event_hash.",
  "targets": "The code compares the generated hash with event.event_hash; this comparison could potentially be misused if event.event_hash is manipulated, but generally it is a verification step.",
  "flows": "The function generates a hash from the api_key and event data, then compares it to the provided event_hash to verify legitimacy.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard libraries and typical verification logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard HMAC verification to ensure callback authenticity from HelloSign. It uses the provided api_key and event data to generate a hash and compares it to the event's hash. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The approach aligns with common webhook validation practices, and there are no signs of obfuscation, data exfiltration, or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of webhook verification using HMAC. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to be a secure and correct validation method.",
