{
  "purpose": "To verify the authenticity of callback events from HelloSign by validating HMAC signatures.",
  "sources": "Reads 'api_key' input and 'event' object, specifically 'event.event_time', 'event.event_type', and 'event.event_hash'.",
  "targets": "Uses HMAC with the provided 'api_key' and event data to generate a hash for comparison.",
  "flows": "Constructs HMAC hash from 'api_key', 'event.event_time', 'event.event_type' and compares it to 'event.event_hash'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements HMAC validation for webhook authenticity, which is standard practice. It accepts external input via the 'event' object and the 'api_key', but these are expected parameters for such a verification process. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects. The use of HMAC with a secret key for validation aligns with secure design principles. The 'api_key' is passed as an argument rather than hardcoded, reducing risk. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard, secure validation of webhook callbacks using HMAC. There are no indications of malicious intent or security issues within this snippet.",
