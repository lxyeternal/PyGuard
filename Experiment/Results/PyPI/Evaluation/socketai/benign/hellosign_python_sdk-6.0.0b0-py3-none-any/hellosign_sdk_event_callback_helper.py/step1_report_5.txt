{
  "purpose": "To verify that a callback request originates from HelloSign by comparing HMAC signatures.",
  "sources": "Reads the api_key parameter and properties from the event object (event.event_time, event.event_type, event.event_hash).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Generates an HMAC hash from api_key and event data, then compares it with event.event_hash.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard cryptographic verification practices with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code securely generates an HMAC SHA256 hash based on the provided api_key and event data, then compares it to a provided hash to verify authenticity. No hardcoded secrets or insecure practices are present. It relies on the assumption that event.event_hash is provided by the callback request, which is standard for webhook validation. The code structure and logic are typical for HMAC validation, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code correctly implements a standard webhook validation method without malicious intent or security issues. It is a legitimate security measure to verify callbacks from HelloSign.",
