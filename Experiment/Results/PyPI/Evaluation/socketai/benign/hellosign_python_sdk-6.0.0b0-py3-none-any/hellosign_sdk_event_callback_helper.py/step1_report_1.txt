{
  "purpose": "Verify that a callback request is legitimately from HelloSign by comparing computed HMAC hash with the provided event hash.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'api_key' and 'event' object attributes ('event.event_time', 'event.event_type', 'event.event_hash').",
  "sinks": "Uses 'hmac.new' to generate a hash for comparison; no data leaks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Hash is generated from 'api_key' and event attributes, then compared with 'event.event_hash' to validate authenticity.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard for callback verification; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements HMAC verification using the provided API key and event data. It compares a computed hash with the event's provided hash to authenticate the callback. No external or malicious actions are evident. The code structure is straightforward, with proper use of cryptographic functions for validation. No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard callback verification for HelloSign events without any malicious intent or security issues. It is a typical implementation of HMAC-based request validation.",
