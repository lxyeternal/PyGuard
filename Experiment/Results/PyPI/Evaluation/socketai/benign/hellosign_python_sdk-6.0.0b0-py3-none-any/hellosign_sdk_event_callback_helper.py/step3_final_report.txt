{
  "purpose": "To verify the authenticity of webhook callbacks from HelloSign using HMAC SHA-256 signature validation.",
  "sources": "event.event_time, event.event_type, api_key",
  "sinks": "event.event_hash comparison for validation",
  "flows": "Concatenate event_time and event_type, generate HMAC hash with api_key, compare with event_hash",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements HMAC verification for webhook validation, using provided event data and API key. It employs standard libraries (hmac, hashlib) and performs a secure comparison. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The logic aligns with best practices, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation of webhook signature verification with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security and malware scores are appropriate; the risk score is minimal and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
