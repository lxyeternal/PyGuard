  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the class as a configuration handler for the HelloSign SDK, with inputs from parameters and environment variables. Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Mentions API keys, headers, URL generation, which are all standard and expected. No untrusted data flow into insecure operations is indicated.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. Uses standard libraries. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report concludes the code is legitimate with high confidence (1). This aligns with the code's straightforward design.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1, with emphasis on credential handling. Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted input flows into insecure operations. API keys and tokens are managed via parameters.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Standard SDK configuration.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately low malware and obfuscation scores, with a slightly higher security risk (0.2) due to the handling of credentials, which is normal for SDK configs.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 (reasonable)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar to previous, with focus on input parameters and server URL generation. No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 (appropriate, given the handling of sensitive info)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Emphasizes standard credential and URL management, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 (appropriate)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Reiterates the standard nature of the SDK configuration, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (reasonable)\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code is straightforward, handling credentials and server URLs in a typical manner.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly set to 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports due to credential handling, which is expected in SDK configs, but no actual vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The code is a standard SDK configuration class, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, inherent to SDK configuration but no real vulnerability)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard SDK configuration class with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
