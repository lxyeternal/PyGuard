{
  "purpose": "This code defines a configuration class for the HelloSign SDK, managing API keys, authentication, server URLs, SSL settings, and logging configurations.",
  "sources": "Parameters provided during instantiation (e.g., api_key, username, password, host), environment variables, and internal class attributes.",
  "sinks": "HTTP headers for API keys and authentication tokens, URL templates for server endpoints, logging handlers, and SSL verification settings.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into headers and URL construction; credentials are used to generate authentication headers; server URL templates are populated with variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. Validation of client-side validation keywords is standard. No network activity or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated SDK configuration class, handling credentials and server settings securely via parameters. It performs validation on certain fields and manages logging. No malicious or obfuscated code is evident. The URL substitution is straightforward, with no injection vulnerabilities if inputs are sanitized externally. The malware score is 0, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to credential handling outside this code, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate, auto-generated SDK configuration class with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and risk scores are justified given its purpose and implementation.",
