{
  "purpose": "The code defines a configuration class for the HelloSign SDK, managing API connection settings, authentication, logging, and server configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters, environment variables, and user input for setting up API credentials and server details.",
  "sinks": "Uses API keys, basic auth headers, and OAuth tokens to authenticate API requests; potentially vulnerable if these credentials are hardcoded or leaked.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters flow from class instantiation to setting up authentication headers and server URLs used in API requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present; no evidence of malicious code such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Logging and validation are standard. The code is predominantly boilerplate generated by an OpenAPI tool, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated SDK configuration class. It manages API keys, authentication methods, server URLs, and logging settings. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network payloads, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code performs typical SDK setup functions without any suspicious or anomalous logic. No hardcoded secrets, network communications, or obfuscation are evident. The only potential concern is if API keys or credentials are improperly handled outside this code, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK configuration class with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It provides mechanisms for secure handling of API credentials and server settings but does not contain any malicious code or supply chain sabotage elements. The malware score is low, and security risks are minimal.",
