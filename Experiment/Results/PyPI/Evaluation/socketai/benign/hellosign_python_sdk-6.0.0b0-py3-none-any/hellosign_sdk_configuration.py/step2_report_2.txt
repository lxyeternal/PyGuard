  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the class as a configuration handler for the HelloSign SDK, with inputs from user parameters and environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Authentication headers, URL generation, and logging handlers are typical sinks; data flows are straightforward.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets. The URL substitution is simple and unlikely to be exploited unless inputs are maliciously crafted externally.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that there's no malicious intent or security risk aligns with the code. Malware score 0, risk 0, confidence 1.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning is sound. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on configuration management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Authentication headers, URL formation, logging setup. No external untrusted input flows into critical security-sensitive operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. Credential handling is via parameters, standard practice.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears benign. Malware score 0, risk 0.2 (low), confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is consistent. No modifications necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—configuration class with credentials and server settings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Authentication headers, URL construction, logging.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets. Uses environment variables and parameters securely.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity detected. Malware score 0, risk 0.1, confidence 0.95.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-reasoned. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar SDK configuration handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API keys, headers, server URLs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors. Credential handling is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is benign. Malware score 0, risk 0.1, confidence 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others—SDK configuration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Authentication headers, server URLs, logging.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets. The code is auto-generated boilerplate.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity. Malware score 0, risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Presence:** The code matches the descriptions; it's a standard SDK configuration class.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware or obfuscation in any report.\n- **Risks:** Very low, as credentials are handled via parameters, and no suspicious network activity or backdoors are detected.\n- **Scores:** Consistent with the analysis; all reports assign malware scores of 0 and low security risks.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, related to credential handling but not risky in context)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (due to potential external misuse if credentials are mishandled outside this code, but not from the code itself)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK configuration class with no malicious or suspicious features. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent.",
