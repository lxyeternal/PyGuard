{
  "purpose": "This code defines a configuration class for the HelloSign SDK, handling API keys, authentication, logging, and server settings.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters during instantiation, environment variables, and internal methods accessing class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Authorization headers, API key handling, and environment-dependent configurations which could potentially leak credentials if misused.",
  "flows": "Parameters such as api_key, access_token, username, and password flow into authentication headers; server URL generation uses variables; logger configuration flows into logging handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code behaviors; use of exception handling for invalid variables is standard; no obfuscated code or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly initializes and manages configuration settings for the SDK, including API keys, authentication, logging, and server URL construction. It handles sensitive data by accepting input parameters, not embedding secrets directly in code. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or backdoors are evident. The use of standard libraries like urllib3 for headers and logging for debug info is appropriate. The class supports dynamic host URL creation with variable substitution, which is typical for SDKs. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. No malicious or backdoor code identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration class for an SDK, with standard handling of API keys, authentication, and server settings. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. The design is conventional and adheres to common SDK practices.",
