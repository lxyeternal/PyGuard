{
  "purpose": "This code serves as boilerplate setup for the HelloSign SDK, importing necessary modules and setting version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'hellosign_sdk' modules and version declaration.",
  "sinks": "None; static import statements and comments do not process untrusted data or perform actions affecting system security.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static imports and variable declarations only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for SDK initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements, version info, and comments, with no dynamic code, network activity, or data handling. It is typical SDK setup code with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The absence of code execution, data leaks, or suspicious patterns indicates a benign purpose. The version string being a beta does not imply malicious intent but suggests pre-release status. The code's static nature and lack of sensitive data or external communication confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements and metadata for SDK setup. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting its safe and standard nature.",
