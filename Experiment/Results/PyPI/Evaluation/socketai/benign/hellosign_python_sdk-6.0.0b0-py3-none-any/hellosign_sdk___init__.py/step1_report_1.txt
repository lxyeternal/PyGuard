  "purpose": "This code imports modules and classes for the HelloSign SDK, setting up the environment for API interactions.",
  "sources": "No direct input sources are present in this code; it mainly imports modules and sets version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present; no data leaks or external communications are evident.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is standard setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports SDK modules, exceptions, and helper classes, and sets a version string. There are no dynamic or external data handling, no execution of untrusted code, and no network activity. It appears to be boilerplate setup code for the HelloSign SDK with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK import and configuration snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply prepares the environment for further use of the SDK.",
