  "purpose": "This code is a Python module that imports classes and exceptions from the hellosign_sdk library to facilitate interaction with the HelloSign API.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes and exceptions from the hellosign_sdk package.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or potentially leaked.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks identified; the code only imports modules and defines version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior observed. The presence of API-related imports is standard for SDK setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains comments and import statements for a SDK package. No data input, external data handling, or execution of untrusted code is present. The comments indicate API versioning and contact info. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward SDK import setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard boilerplate code for initializing API interaction in a client application.",
