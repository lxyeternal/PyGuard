  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of import statements from the `hellosign_sdk` package, setting a version string, and including comments about the API version and contact info.\n- There are no dynamic data flows, no network activity, no data processing, no input/output operations, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.\n- The code appears to be boilerplate setup for the SDK, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1-5 common points:**\n- Purpose: Import modules/classes, set version info.\n- Sources: Imports from `hellosign_sdk`.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static imports, no data flow.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard SDK setup, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no security risks.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Malware: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is boilerplate SDK initialization code.\n- No data input, network activity, or code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The presence of a version string indicating a beta release is normal.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring considerations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Since there's no malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity, the malware score should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation is present, so **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the lack of any security concerns, malicious activity, or vulnerabilities, the risk score should be **0**.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned (all zeros) are appropriate.\n- No changes needed; the reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The reasoning in the reports is sound and aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate. The code is standard SDK setup code with no security concerns. The scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.",
