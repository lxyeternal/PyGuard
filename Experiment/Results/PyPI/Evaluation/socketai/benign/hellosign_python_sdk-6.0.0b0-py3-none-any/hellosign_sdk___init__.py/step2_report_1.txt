  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is solely composed of import statements, version declarations, and comments.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network activity, data handling, or untrusted input processing is present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - The code appears to be boilerplate setup for the HelloSign SDK.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code is straightforward and standard; no logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The reports correctly identify that this is setup code with no malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, readable import statements.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified as there's no security risk in this static setup code.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports are cautious and correctly identify that the code is benign.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on the code content.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is purely boilerplate SDK setup with no malicious or security concern.\n   - The confidence in this assessment is high (confidence=1).\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, contains no malicious activity, and is standard SDK import/setup code. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
