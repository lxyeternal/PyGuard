{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize and import components for the HelloSign SDK, likely for use in interacting with the HelloSign API.",
  "sources": "Import statements for SDK modules, configurations, exceptions, and helper classes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; mainly static imports and initializations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present. No dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments, version information, and import statements. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or system modifications. The presence of version comments and import statements aligns with standard SDK initialization. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward SDK setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger application that interacts with HelloSign services. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security concerns are evident.",
