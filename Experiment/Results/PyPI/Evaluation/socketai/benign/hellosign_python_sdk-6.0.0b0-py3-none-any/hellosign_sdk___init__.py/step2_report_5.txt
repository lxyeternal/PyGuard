  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the corresponding reports carefully.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code.**  \nThe code is a set of import statements, version declarations, and comments. No dynamic code, data processing, network activity, or external input handling is present. All reports correctly identify this as boilerplate SDK setup code.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning.**  \nThe reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks. This is consistent with the static import-based code provided. No logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue.**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. Given the code's nature, this seems appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation.  \n- **Security risk score:** 0, aligning with the benign assessment.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5.**  \nNo issues warrant a higher risk score. The code is purely import statements with no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any claims based on assumptions.**  \nAll reports are cautious and accurate, assuming the code is only what is shown. Since there's no evidence of malicious intent, this assumption holds.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure consistency of scores with the report.**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis: all zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward SDK import and setup snippet with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is typical boilerplate code for initializing an SDK environment.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately conclude that the code is benign. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
