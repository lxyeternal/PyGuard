  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements and version setting for the HelloSign SDK.\n- No dynamic code, external data processing, network activity, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be boilerplate setup code for SDK initialization.\n- The reports consistently assign a malware score of 0, with high confidence (1), and no obfuscation or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The reports do not identify any issues, and the code is purely static import statements with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, standard SDK setup code.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since there's no security risk.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The code is straightforward and does not include any code execution, data handling, or network communication, so there's no reason to assign higher scores.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The version string is a beta (`6.0.0-beta`), which indicates a development or pre-release version, but this does not imply maliciousness.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign SDK setup boilerplate with no malicious, obfuscated, or security issues. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
