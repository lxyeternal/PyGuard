  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'flatten_json' Python package for distribution",
  "sources": "Static strings and data in setup() parameters such as package name, author, URL, dependencies, and entry points",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external data output",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic data flows",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present; all data appears static and standard for package setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with package metadata and configuration. No code execution, input/output, or dynamic behavior is present. The email and URL are publicly known and standard, with no suspicious patterns. The entry point defines a CLI script, which is typical. No signs of malicious intent or malicious code snippets are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a typical package configuration file.",
