  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distribution of the 'flatten_json' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads static package metadata (name, packages, version, description, author info, url, keywords, classifiers, entry points, dependencies).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines package metadata and entry points.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code follows standard setup.py conventions without suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup. It defines metadata including name, version, description, author, and dependencies. The entry point specifies a console script, indicating command-line interface functionality. All components are static and standard for Python package distribution. No user input, external data, or dynamic code execution is present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only provides package metadata and a command-line entry point without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
