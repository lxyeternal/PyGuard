{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'flatten_json' Python package, including metadata and entry points for CLI usage.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data during execution.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data handling or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as there are no data input or processing operations in this setup script.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The code strictly defines package metadata and setup instructions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and configures the package setup parameters such as name, version, description, author info, URL, dependencies, and CLI entry point. It is a standard setup.py file with no dynamic code execution, no data input/output, and no embedded malicious code. The comments suggest how to build and upload the package, which is typical for Python project distributions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It adheres to standard practices and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code.",
