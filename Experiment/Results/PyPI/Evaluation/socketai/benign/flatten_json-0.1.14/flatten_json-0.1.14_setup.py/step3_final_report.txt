  "purpose": "Standard package setup configuration for the 'flatten_json' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package name, version, author info, URL, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and static with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, containing static package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point. No dynamic code, input/output handling, or external data fetching is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of suspicious or malicious elements. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the script, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The confidence scores are high, reflecting static analysis. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is a standard, benign package configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
