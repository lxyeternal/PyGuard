  "purpose": "To configure and package the 'flatten_json' Python library for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version, description, author info, URL, keywords, classifiers) and specifies dependencies ('six').",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no input/output or external data processing occurs in this script.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not handle untrusted data flow or process external input beyond static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the setup script is standard and straightforward with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "This setup.py script defines package metadata and configuration for distribution. It includes typical fields such as package name, version, description, author info, URL, dependencies, and entry points. There are no external data inputs, no code execution beyond the standard setuptools setup call, and no suspicious or malicious constructs. It adheres to standard packaging practices without obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The script appears safe and is typical for open-source Python package configuration.",
