{
  "purpose": "This script provides utilities for flattening and unflattening nested dictionaries, including list preservation, and includes a CLI interface for JSON processing.",
  "sources": "Input is read from sys.stdin; data is loaded via json.loads. No other external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Output is written to sys.stdout; no other sinks or external connections are present.",
  "flows": "Input JSON data flows from sys.stdin through json.loads, into flatten functions, then the flattened JSON string flows to sys.stdout via json.dumps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code includes complex flattening logic with global variables and recursive functions, but no signs of malicious behavior or data exfiltration mechanisms. No network activity, external domain connections, or system modifications are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for dictionary flattening/unflattening with some recursive and list-processing logic. No input validation beyond type assertions, but no malicious handling of inputs or outputs. No obfuscated code, code injection, or suspicious data handling detected. The functions are standard data processing routines. The CLI reads JSON data, processes it, and outputs the result, consistent with typical data transformation utilities. No hidden or malicious actions are present. Complexity and extensive recursion might pose security risks if misused, but not in this context. No indications of supply chain attacks or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for data transformation with no malicious or sabotage features. It is well-structured, and no suspicious or harmful behavior was detected. The overall security risk is very low.",
