  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for flattening and unflattening nested dictionaries, especially useful for processing complex JSON-like data structures.",
  "sources": "Reads data from sys.stdin in the cli() function; input JSON data for flattening.",
  "sinks": "Outputs flattened JSON to sys.stdout in the cli() function.",
  "flows": "Reads input JSON from stdin → parses JSON → flattens data → outputs flattened JSON to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external network calls. Functions are standard utility operations. No obfuscated or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs standard data processing tasks without hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script defines multiple functions for flattening and unflattening nested dictionaries, including handling complex nested structures and lists. It performs input validation, recursive processing, and optional list preservation features. The CLI entry point reads JSON input from stdin, flattens it, and writes output to stdout, typical for a command-line utility. No network activity, file operations, or external code execution is present. All operations are self-contained data transformations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or reverse shells. The structure and flow are straightforward, with no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for data structure transformation with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It handles data securely without external communication or covert behaviors. The functions are typical and do not exhibit malicious or suspicious features.",
