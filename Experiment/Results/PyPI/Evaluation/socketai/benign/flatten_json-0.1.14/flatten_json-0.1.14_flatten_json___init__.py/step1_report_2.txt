  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for flattening and unflattening nested dictionaries, including preserving lists, and offers a CLI interface for JSON processing.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON input from stdin in the cli() function.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON data to stdout in the cli() function.",
  "flows": "Input JSON is read from stdin, processed by flatten(), and written to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No code injection, data leakage, or unsafe operations observed. No network activity, reverse shells, or data theft code present.",
  "analysis": "The script focuses on data transformation—flattening and unflattening nested structures—with utility functions. It imports standard libraries and defines functions for processing nested dicts and lists. There are no suspicious network operations, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated segments. The only I/O is via stdin and stdout, typical for command-line utilities, and no external calls or potentially malicious activities are present. The code appears to be a standard utility module for JSON structure manipulation, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for JSON processing with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It functions as a data transformation tool without any network or system manipulation features. The overall security risk is negligible.",
