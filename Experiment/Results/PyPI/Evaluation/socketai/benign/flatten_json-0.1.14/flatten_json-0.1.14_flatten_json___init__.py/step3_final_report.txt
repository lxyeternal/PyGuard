  "purpose": "Utility functions for flattening and unflattening nested JSON-like dictionaries and lists, including CLI interface for processing JSON data from stdin and stdout.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON data from stdin during CLI execution; internal functions access nested data structures during flattening/unflattening processes.",
  "sinks": "Outputs flattened JSON data to stdout; no external system interactions or data exfiltration points identified.",
  "flows": "Input JSON → parsing → recursive flattening/unflattening functions → output JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data transformation tasks with recursive functions, assertions, and standard libraries. It does not include any network calls, code injection, or obfuscated code. The recursive logic and global variables manage complex nested structures but do not introduce security vulnerabilities. No malicious patterns or backdoors are present. The complexity is typical for such utilities and does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility library for JSON flattening and unflattening. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and minimal risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
