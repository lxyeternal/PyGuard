{
  "purpose": "This script provides functions to flatten and unflatten nested dictionaries and lists, primarily for processing JSON-like data structures, with a CLI interface for JSON flattening.",
  "sources": "Reads input JSON data from stdin in the CLI function, and processes data within flatten, flatten_preserve_lists, unflatten, and unflatten_list functions.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks of untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities are present; the code does not write or send data to external systems or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Input JSON data flows from stdin into the CLI function, which passes it to flatten; data transformations occur within the flattening functions, and results are written to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code uses standard data processing techniques and libraries without obfuscation or hidden actions.",
  "analysis": "The code offers utility functions for dictionary manipulation, with careful handling of nested structures, and does not contain any external network calls, dynamic code execution, or data leaks. There are no signs of malicious backdoors, code injection points, or privacy violations. It strictly processes input data for formatting purposes without interacting with environment variables, external systems, or performing insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for flattening and unflattening JSON data structures, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is a standard implementation of data transformation functions with no suspicious activities.",
