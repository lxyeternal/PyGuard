  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of exec() for deprecation aliasing is a known pattern and does not indicate malicious behavior. The scores across reports are appropriate, with minimal risk scores (~0.1-0.2) reflecting the controlled use of exec(). Overall, the code is safe and standard for such a library setup."
