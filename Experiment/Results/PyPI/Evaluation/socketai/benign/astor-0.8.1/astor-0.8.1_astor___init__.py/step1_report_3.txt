{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and compatibility aliases for the 'astor' library, mainly for AST manipulation and code generation in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads a 'VERSION' file from the filesystem, imports modules, and defines functions that access global variables and functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any typical sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system command executions that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The primary flow involves reading the version from a file and setting up deprecated aliases that redirect to existing functions with warning prompts.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically executes a large string of deprecated function aliases via exec(), which could be misused to execute malicious code if the string were compromised. However, in this context, it appears controlled and static. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code uses warnings to deprecate functions but no suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a version number from a file, defines a deprecation mechanism to warn users about outdated functions, and sets up aliases for backward compatibility. The use of exec() with a static string for deprecations is risky in a malicious context but appears controlled here. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The code's structure is typical for library setup and compatibility layers, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard library setup script for the 'astor' Python package, including deprecated aliasing and version reading. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code segment.",
