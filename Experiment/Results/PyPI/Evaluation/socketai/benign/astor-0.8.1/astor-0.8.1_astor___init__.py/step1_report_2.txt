{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and imports for manipulating Python ASTs, including deprecated aliases and version handling.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'VERSION' file in the current directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data is sent to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file read ('VERSION') to the __version__ variable; no other data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of deprecated alias definitions, dynamic code execution via exec(deprecated), and runtime warnings setup; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules, reads a version file, sets up deprecated function aliases, and defines a deprecation warning wrapper. The use of exec to execute deprecated alias definitions is a potential risk but appears limited to setting up backward compatibility. No evidence of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The code mainly handles deprecation warnings and module setup. The dynamic execution via exec is contained within the module and does not execute untrusted code. Overall, the code appears safe, serving as a library utility with deprecation support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a library utility module with deprecation handling and version reading, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. Its main activity is setting up deprecated aliases and reading a version file; no malicious behaviors are detected.",
