{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and backward compatibility aliases for the 'astor' library, which manipulates Python Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).",
  "sources": "Reads the 'VERSION' file to determine the version number.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow detected; primarily defines functions, imports, and deprecation wrappers.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'exec' to dynamically define deprecated functions, which can be risky but is used here solely for aliasing and warnings; no hardcoded credentials or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules related to AST manipulation, reads a version string from a file, and sets up deprecated aliases for older functions to maintain backward compatibility. The 'exec' function is used to define deprecated functions dynamically, issuing warnings when these aliases are called. There are no network connections, system modifications, or malicious behaviors. The use of 'exec' is solely for defining deprecated functions, which is a common pattern for such purposes, not malicious in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving mainly as a compatibility layer and utility functions for the 'astor' library. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. The use of 'exec' for aliasing is safe in this context.",
