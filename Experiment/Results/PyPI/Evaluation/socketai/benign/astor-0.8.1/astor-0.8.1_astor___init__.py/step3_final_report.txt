{
  "purpose": "The code sets up the 'astor' library, handling version reading, module imports, and deprecated aliasing for backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from a file; defines deprecated functions via exec(); imports modules and sets global variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network, file writes, or external command execution.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; primarily static alias definitions and version loading.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to define deprecated aliases, which could be risky if the string were compromised, but here it is static and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup module for a Python library, with version management and deprecation aliasing. The exec() usage is limited to static strings for backward compatibility, which is a common pattern. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this benign assessment, with slight elevation in security risk due to exec(), but justified given the controlled context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of exec() for deprecation aliasing is a known pattern and does not indicate malicious behavior. The scores across reports are appropriate, with minimal risk scores (~0.1-0.2) reflecting the controlled use of exec(). Overall, the code is safe and standard for such a library setup.",
