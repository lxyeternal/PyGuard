  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility for reading files relative to the script's directory. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The main security consideration is ensuring that 'parts' are sanitized if derived from untrusted sources to prevent directory traversal. The malware score is correctly zero, and the risk score is appropriately low, with high confidence in the benign assessment."
