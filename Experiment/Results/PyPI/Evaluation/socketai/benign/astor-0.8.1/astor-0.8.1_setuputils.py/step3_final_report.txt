  "purpose": "A utility function to read the contents of a file located relative to the script's directory.",
  "sources": "The function constructs a file path using os.path.join with __file__ and the provided parts.",
  "sinks": "The file is opened with codecs.open in read mode; no untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input parts are combined into a path; the path is used to open and read a file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; potential directory traversal if parts are untrusted, but this is a common pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward file reader that constructs a path relative to the script. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or dynamic execution. The only security concern is that if parts are derived from untrusted input, directory traversal could occur, leading to reading unintended files. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code and acknowledge the potential misuse if input is not sanitized. Malware scores are zero across all reports, and obfuscation is absent. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the potential for directory traversal in untrusted scenarios, but this is a common and manageable concern rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility for reading files relative to the script's directory. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The main security consideration is ensuring that 'parts' are sanitized if derived from untrusted sources to prevent directory traversal. The malware score is correctly zero, and the risk score is appropriately low, with high confidence in the benign assessment.",
