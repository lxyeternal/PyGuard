  "purpose": "Read the content of a file located relative to the script's directory.",
  "sources": "The function reads data from a file specified by the *parts parameters, which are combined into a path.",
  "sinks": "The data is read into memory; no data is directly sent elsewhere in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Input (file path components) -> file system read operation -> data stored in variable.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious file paths, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic behaviors. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward operations.",
  "analysis": "The function 'read' constructs a file path based on the script's directory and provided path parts, then opens and reads the file's contents. The use of 'codecs.open' indicates potential support for various encodings but does not inherently imply malicious intent. The code appears to be a simple utility for reading files relative to the script location. No external network access, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and structurally simple, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility function for reading file contents relative to its location. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
