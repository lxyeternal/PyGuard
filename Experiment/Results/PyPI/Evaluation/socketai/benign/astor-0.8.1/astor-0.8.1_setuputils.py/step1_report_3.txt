  "purpose": "Read and return the contents of a file given its path components",
  "sources": "os.path.join, codecs.open, __file__, input parameters (*parts)",
  "sinks": "Reading file content; potential for reading sensitive files if misuse occurs",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> os.path.join -> codecs.open -> read() -> return content",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed; no obfuscation or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to read a file's content based on provided path components. It constructs the file path relative to the current script's directory, then opens and reads the file. No untrusted input validation, no network activity, and no malicious behaviors are present. Usage appears straightforward and benign, primarily for local file reading.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard file-reading utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is simple and safe under normal usage conditions.",
