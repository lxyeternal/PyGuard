{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for mapping Python AST nodes to symbols and precedences, mainly used for AST manipulation and parsing.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'ast' module; defines 'op_data' string which contains operator information.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions or code sections interact with untrusted data, system resources, or external inputs.",
  "flows": "The code processes static data ('op_data') to generate dictionaries mapping AST node types to symbols and precedences. Functions retrieve this data based on AST node objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward and based solely on static data and standard AST module usage. No obfuscated or malicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with importing the 'ast' module, then defines static operator data in 'op_data'. It parses this data into lists and builds dictionaries for operator symbols and precedences, scaling the precedence values for ordering. It provides functions to retrieve operator symbols and precedences for given AST nodes, and a class 'Precedence' that aggregates precedence levels. All code operates on static, predefined data and standard library modules, with no input/output or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for AST node analysis, with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. It relies solely on static data and standard Python libraries. Overall, this code is safe.",
