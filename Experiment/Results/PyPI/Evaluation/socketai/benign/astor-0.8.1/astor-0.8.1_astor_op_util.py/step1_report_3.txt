{
  "purpose": "The code provides data and functions for mapping Python AST nodes to symbols and precedence levels, primarily used for AST manipulation and analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'ast' module and reads embedded string data 'op_data' for node types, symbols, and precedence.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'ast' module functions and built-in functions like 'type()' and string formatting; no direct sinks indicating data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded into dictionaries from embedded strings; functions retrieve symbols and precedence based on AST node objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. The code appears to be a straightforward utility module. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines static data for operator symbols and precedences, processes it into dictionaries, and provides utility functions for retrieving symbol strings and precedence levels from AST nodes. The processing includes combining and scaling precedence values but no dynamic or insecure code execution. The module relies solely on the 'ast' module and safe string manipulations. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for AST node analysis, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a straightforward, well-structured implementation without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
