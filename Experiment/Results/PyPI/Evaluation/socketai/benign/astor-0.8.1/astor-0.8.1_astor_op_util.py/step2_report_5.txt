  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, potential security issues, or reasoning flaws.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static, operates solely on predefined data, and uses standard libraries without external inputs or network activity.\n- No report identifies any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs.\n- The code's purpose is clearly utility-oriented: mapping AST node types to symbols and precedence levels for parsing or formatting.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's security posture:\n\n- **Code behavior:** The code processes static data (`op_data`) into dictionaries for symbol and precedence lookups. Functions `get_op_symbol` and `get_op_precedence` retrieve data based on AST node objects. The class `Precedence` encapsulates precedence levels.\n- **Potential attack vectors:** No user input, no external data, no dynamic code execution, no file/network operations.\n- **Malicious constructs:** None detected. The code is straightforward and relies on static data.\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and readable.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0 or near-zero, consistent with the static, safe design.\n\n### Logical flaws or issues:\n\n- **Functionality correctness:** The code correctly processes static data, scales precedence values, and provides utility functions.\n- **Any errors or flaws?** No. The logic is sound, and the data processing is straightforward.\n- **Potential misclassification:** No reason to increase risk or malware scores based on the provided code.\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The report that assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1 (Report 5) seems to overstate the risk. The code does not perform any insecure operations.\n- The highest precedence value is computed as `max(z for x, y, z in op_data) + 2`, which is a standard way to define a maximum precedence margin. No issues here.\n- The code does not obfuscate or hide any malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** **0** — no security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, but the slight elevation of `securityRisk` in report 5 (0.1) is unwarranted given the code's benign nature.\n- The overall conclusion is that the code is safe, static, and intended as a utility for AST manipulation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk | Justification |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     | Static data, no malicious behavior. |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     | Utility functions, no external input. |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     | Clear, static processing, no risks. |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     | No suspicious activity, safe design. |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     | Benign static utility, no security threat. |\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a benign utility module with no security issues. The reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate, with the exception of a minor overstatement in report 5 regarding security risk.",
