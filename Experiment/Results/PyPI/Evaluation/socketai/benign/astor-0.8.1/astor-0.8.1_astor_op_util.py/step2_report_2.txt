  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and the reasoning, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a static utility module that maps AST node types to symbols and precedence levels.\n- It relies solely on predefined static data (`op_data`) and the standard `ast` module.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- The functions `get_op_symbol` and `get_op_precedence` are straightforward, based on type mappings.\n- The `Precedence` class aggregates precedence values for various operators.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n\n- The code **does not** contain any malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious patterns.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or external data handling.\n- The static data (`op_data`) appears consistent and is processed in a predictable manner.\n- The functions are safe and serve as utilities for AST analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Issues or Flaws in the Reports:\n\n- **No issues** are identified in the code itself.\n- The reports correctly conclude that the code is benign, with no security risks or malware.\n- The reasoning is consistent with the code's static, data-driven nature.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0.0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0.0`, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign very low or zero risk, which aligns with the static, utility nature of the code.\n\n### Specific Comments on Scores:\n\n- **Report 5** assigns a slightly higher `securityRisk` of 0.1, citing minimal concerns about static data. This is acceptable but still low.\n- The other reports correctly assign zero or near-zero scores for malware and obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the claims about the code's security and behavior accurate?**  \n  Yes. The code is a static mapping utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero. The risk scores are minimal, reflecting the static, benign nature.\n\n- **Any assumptions that are unwarranted?**  \n  No. All assessments are based on static data and standard library usage, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall malware score:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (keeping the conservative note from report 5 about static data, but still very low)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a benign utility for AST node mapping, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The assessments and scores across all reports are consistent and justified. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the static, safe, and straightforward nature of the code.",
