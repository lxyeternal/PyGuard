{
  "purpose": "Provides static mappings from AST node types to symbols and precedence levels for Python AST manipulation.",
  "sources": "Static data embedded in 'op_data' and the 'ast' module for type references.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external inputs, or network interactions are involved.",
  "flows": "Static data processed into dictionaries; functions retrieve data based on AST node objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static utility module that converts AST node types into symbols and precedence values. It processes embedded static data into lookup dictionaries and provides functions to retrieve this information based on AST node objects. The 'Precedence' class aggregates precedence levels. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or network activity. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and relies solely on static data and standard library modules. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility for AST node mapping with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores across the reports are consistent with this analysis.",
