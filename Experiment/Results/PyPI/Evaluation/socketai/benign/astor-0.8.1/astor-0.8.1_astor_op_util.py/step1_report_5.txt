{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and data structures for mapping Python AST nodes to symbols and precedences, primarily used for parsing or code analysis within the 'astor' library.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'ast' module; reads 'op_data' string containing operator information.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling; no network, file, or environment interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; functions simply map AST node types to symbols and precedences based on predefined data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior; the code appears to be straightforward data processing and mapping logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static operator data and processes it into lookup dictionaries for symbol and precedence mappings. It offers functions to retrieve these mappings given AST nodes. No external data, network operations, or suspicious logic are present. The code is well-structured, documented, and performs no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. It appears as standard utility code for AST manipulation, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code used for AST analysis, with no malicious or security-threatening behaviors. It does not contain any malware, backdoors, or suspicious logic. Overall security risk is minimal.",
