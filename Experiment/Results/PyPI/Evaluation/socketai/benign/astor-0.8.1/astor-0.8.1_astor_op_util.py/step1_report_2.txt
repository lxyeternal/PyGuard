{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and data for mapping Python AST nodes to symbols and precedences, mainly for use in AST manipulation or formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the imported 'ast' module, string data 'op_data' for operator precedences and symbols, and the input objects for functions 'get_op_symbol' and 'get_op_precedence'.",
  "sinks": "The functions 'get_op_symbol' and 'get_op_precedence' produce output based on the type of AST node objects; no untrusted data input or output sink is present. No external data or untrusted input is processed.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The functions operate solely on provided AST node objects and internal data. No external network or system interactions are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code does perform type-based mapping which is standard for AST processing. No obfuscation or unusual behavior is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'ast' module and defines a data string 'op_data' that maps operator names to their precedence and symbol. It processes 'op_data' into structured lists, then constructs dictionaries for precedence and symbol mappings. The functions 'get_op_symbol' and 'get_op_precedence' retrieve symbol and precedence information based on AST node objects. The 'Precedence' class updates its attributes with operator precedences. All code appears to be for utility purposes related to AST manipulation, with no signs of malicious activity, external data handling, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for mapping AST node types to symbols and precedences. It contains no malicious behavior, external data handling, or security risks. It simply provides helper functions for AST processing.",
