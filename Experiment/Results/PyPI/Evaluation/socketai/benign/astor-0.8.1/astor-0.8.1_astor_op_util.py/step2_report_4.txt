  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a static utility for mapping AST nodes to symbols and precedences. No external input, no network activity, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns. \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — aligns well with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign utility.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward static data processing, no external data or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, static data, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe utility.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, static data and straightforward mapping. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar static utility code, with a slightly higher confidence (0.9) and a minimal security risk score (0.1). The risk score might be slightly overestimated given the static nature of the code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — acceptable, but perhaps slightly high for such static code.\n- **Conclusion:** Still benign, but with a tiny perceived risk possibly due to the static data approach.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. I agree with a malware score of 0 across the board.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, static, and straightforward. No obfuscation detected; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is purely static and utility-based, the risk is minimal. The slight variation in report 5 (0.1) might be an overestimation; I would suggest a risk score of **0** for all reports, as static utility code does not pose security risks.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code does not perform any dynamic operations, network I/O, or handle untrusted input.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors.\n- The static data is well-structured and used solely for mapping purposes.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a benign utility module for AST node mapping, with no security concerns.",
