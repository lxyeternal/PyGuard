  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Overall Code Summary:**\n- The code is a static utility module that maps AST node types to symbols and precedence levels.\n- It processes embedded static data ('op_data') into dictionaries for lookups.\n- Functions `get_op_symbol` and `get_op_precedence` retrieve data based on AST nodes.\n- The `Precedence` class aggregates precedence levels.\n- The code relies solely on static data and the standard 'ast' module, with no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears correct and consistent. It correctly processes static data into lookup dictionaries and provides utility functions.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- **Security concerns:** No untrusted data handling, external inputs, or system resource interactions.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None detected; the code is purely static and utility-focused.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **No issues identified.** The code is straightforward and well-structured.\n\n### Scores and their appropriateness:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1; given the static nature, this is reasonable.\n- **Overall risk scores:** Appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Specific observations:\n- **Potential over- or under-scoring:**\n  - The report that assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1 (Report 5) is slightly cautious but not unreasonable, considering the static data could theoretically be manipulated if compromised, but in this context, it's static embedded data.\n  - The other reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 or very close, as the code is a benign utility.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**  \n\n**Justification:**  \n- The code is purely static, with no external dependencies or inputs.  \n- It performs straightforward data processing for AST node mapping.  \n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.  \n- The embedded data is static and standard for AST utilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The risk and malware scores should remain at zero, with perhaps a minimal security risk score (0.0) to reflect the static data, but overall, the code is safe.",
