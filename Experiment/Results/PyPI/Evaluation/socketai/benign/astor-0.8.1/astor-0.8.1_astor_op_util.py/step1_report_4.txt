{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for mapping Python AST nodes to symbols and precedences, mainly used for AST manipulation and parsing.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'ast' module; processes string data defining operators and their precedences.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; functions only process AST node types and static data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; functions map node objects to static symbols and precedences.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The op_data is static, and there is no external input or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code statically defines operator precedence and symbol data, then processes this data into dictionaries for quick lookup. It provides utility functions to get symbols and precedence from AST nodes. No input reading, network activity, or runtime data processing is present. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or hidden backdoors. The only potential concern might be the static data, but it is consistent with typical parser utilities and does not pose security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for AST node handling with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs static data processing and mapping without any suspicious behavior.",
