  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard AST traversal utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The potential security concern is minimal and relates to the use of replace() with untrusted input, which is a typical risk in such tools but not indicative of malicious behavior. Overall, the code is safe for use in static analysis or code transformation tasks."
