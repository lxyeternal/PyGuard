{
  "purpose": "To define package metadata and setup configuration for Python distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library, which is a standard library for packaging Python projects.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only calls setup() without any data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no suspicious or unusual behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setuptools' module and calls its 'setup()' function without any arguments. This is a common pattern for setup scripts in Python projects. The code contains no input handling, no data leaks, and no malicious logic. It performs a basic package configuration step with no evident security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
