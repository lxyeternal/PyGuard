  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; the code imports a library and calls a setup function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the script simply invokes a setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls its 'setup()' function without arguments, which is a common minimal setup script. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. No external data sources or sinks are present, and the code performs a basic package setup task.",
