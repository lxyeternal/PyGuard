{
  "purpose": "This code is used to set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'setuptools' module imported at the beginning.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or output points; the setup() function is called with no arguments.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs beyond importing and invoking setup(), which does not process external or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior. It simply calls setup() with default parameters.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setuptools' library and immediately calls setup() without any configuration arguments. This is typical for Python package setup files (setup.py). There are no signs of malicious activity, no data leaks, no code injections, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and standard for package distribution. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script used for Python package distribution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
