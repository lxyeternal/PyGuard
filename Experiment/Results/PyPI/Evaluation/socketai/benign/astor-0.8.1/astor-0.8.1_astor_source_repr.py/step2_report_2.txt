  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Code formatting utility within astor, focusing on line-wrapping.\n- Sources: String input, no external data.\n- Sinks: No external or sensitive sinks.\n- Flows: String manipulations only.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code, no obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Straightforward formatting functions, no malicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Benign, purely for code prettification.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing line-wrapping and readability.\n- No external sinks or data leaks.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Same conclusion—benign formatting utility.\n- Confidence: 0.95\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focused on formatting, line splitting, delimiter handling.\n- No external data or system calls.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, purely formatting.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar purpose, line wrapping, grouping, parentheses insertion.\n- No external sinks or suspicious activities.\n- Analysis: All string operations, no malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Benign utility.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as others, focusing on source code formatting.\n- No external data or malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, formatting utility.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Behavior:** All reports explicitly state that the code is solely for formatting, with no network, file, or system interactions. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code segments are identified.\n- **Obfuscation & Anomalies:** None detected; the code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the lack of external effects, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns, the security risk scores are appropriately low (~0.1 to 0.1).\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to the complexity of formatting logic, but not indicative of any threat.\n\n**Overall, the code appears to be a benign, utility module for source code formatting, with no malicious or security risks detected.**",
