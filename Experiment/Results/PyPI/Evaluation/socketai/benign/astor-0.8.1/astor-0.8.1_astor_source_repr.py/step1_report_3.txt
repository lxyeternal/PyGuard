{
  "purpose": "The code is part of the 'astor' library for Python AST manipulation, intended for pretty-printing and formatting source code.",
  "sources": "Reads input source code as strings, processes the source into lines and groups, and manipulates these groups for formatting.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks handling untrusted data; no data is written to network, files, or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input source code -> processed into lines/groups -> wrapped or split as needed -> returned as formatted source code.",
  "anomalies": "Contains assertions and complex line wrapping logic; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No suspicious external calls or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on formatting source code strings, splitting lines, wrapping long lines, and handling delimiters for proper indentation. It employs functions like split_lines, wrap_line, and delimiter_groups to process source code text. No network operations, no external data handling, and no indications of malicious behavior. The code includes safety checks such as assertions and controlled string manipulations. It does not access environment variables, system info, or perform any data exfiltration. All logic appears consistent with its purpose of code prettification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard source code formatter, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to improve code readability and formatting without external data access or harmful operations.",
