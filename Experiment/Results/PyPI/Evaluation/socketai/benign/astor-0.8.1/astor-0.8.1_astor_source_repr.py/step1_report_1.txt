{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for prettifying and formatting Python source code, specifically for line-wrapping and splitting lines, as part of the astor library used for AST manipulation and decompilation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input source code as strings, particularly in the functions pretty_source(source) and split_lines(source).",
  "sinks": "The code performs string manipulations and formatting operations; no sinks are present that handle untrusted data for effects like network communication, file operations, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input source code flows into pretty_source, which calls split_lines. split_lines processes the source into lines, which may trigger wrap_line to reformat overly long lines, but no untrusted data is transmitted outside the code context.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The code appears to be purely focused on code formatting and line-wrapping with no obfuscated language features, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation for pretty-printing Python source code, mainly focusing on splitting and wrapping lines for readability. It manages indentation, splitting lines intelligently with regard to delimiters, and attempting to keep lines within a maximum length. There are no network operations, file I/O, or other side effects indicating malicious activity. The logic is self-contained and purely for formatting. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The code relies on standard string operations and assertions for internal consistency.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign source code formatting utility, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is part of a decompiler library aimed at improving readability of decompiled source code. There are no suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious actions detected.",
