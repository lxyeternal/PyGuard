{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for prettifying, splitting, and wrapping Python source code for improved readability and formatting.",
  "sources": "Input strings representing source code, processed within functions like pretty_source() and split_lines().",
  "sinks": "No external sinks, system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "String data flows through line splitting, grouping, and indentation management functions without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. Minor issue: use of '/' for division which results in float in Python 3, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of formatting utilities operating solely on strings, with internal assertions ensuring consistency. No external system interaction, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution. The functions handle line wrapping, delimiter grouping, parentheses insertion, and line splitting, all within the scope of code formatting. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The only minor concern is the use of '/' for division, which could lead to float division in Python 3, but this does not impact security. Overall, the code is a benign utility for source code prettification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign source code formatter with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with its functionality.",
