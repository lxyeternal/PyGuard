{
  "purpose": "The code is part of the astor library for Python AST manipulation, specifically for pretty-printing and formatting Python source code.",
  "sources": "Reads source code input through the 'source' parameter in functions like pretty_source() and split_lines().",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted data into critical operations, external calls, or sensitive data transmission.",
  "flows": "The source data flows through functions for formatting and splitting lines, with no evident transfer to external systems or sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code primarily handles string and line formatting, with no external network or data leaks. No obfuscation or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script implements line splitting, wrapping, and formatting for source code, with functions for handling indentation, delimiter-based grouping, and line wrapping. The logic is consistent with source code prettifying. No external system interaction, data exfiltration, or malicious activity is evident. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious code paths, and all operations are related to code formatting. There are no signs of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured code formatter component with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It solely focuses on source code prettification and formatting.",
