{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for prettifying and formatting Python source code, specifically focusing on line wrapping and splitting code into groups for better readability.",
  "sources": "Reads input source code as strings, processes line items, and manipulates string segments within functions such as split_lines, wrap_line, split_group, and add_parens.",
  "sinks": "Returns formatted code as a string, writes to the result list; no untrusted data directly affects external systems or causes side effects.",
  "flows": "Input source code -> processed through split_lines and related functions -> output formatted source code; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are evident. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or privacy violations are present. The code primarily handles string processing and formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on source code formatting, line wrapping, and syntactic splitting based on delimiters. It includes functions for splitting lines, grouping code segments, adding parentheses for better splitability, and managing indentation and delimiters. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. It does not perform any untrusted input handling beyond standard string operations. The use of assertions and structured grouping indicates careful code design without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a benign, utility-based source code formatter with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs string manipulation to prettify Python code and does not engage in any suspicious activities such as network communication, data theft, or code injection. Overall, it is a safe utility module for source code formatting.",
