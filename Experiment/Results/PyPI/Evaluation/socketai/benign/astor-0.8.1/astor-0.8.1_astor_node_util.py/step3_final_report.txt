  "purpose": "Utility functions for AST traversal, dumping, stripping, and comparison, used for static analysis or transformation of Python code.",
  "sources": "Reading attributes from AST nodes, list elements, and class variables.",
  "sinks": "No external data or system interaction; operates solely on in-memory AST objects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from AST nodes through functions for iteration, dumping, stripping, and comparison; no external or network data involved.",
  "anomalies": "The 'allow_ast_comparison' function dynamically modifies core AST classes at runtime, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility library for AST manipulation with no external input/output, code execution, or network activity. The monkey-patching in 'allow_ast_comparison' could potentially be misused but is documented and intended for comparison purposes. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with the slight risk due to runtime class modification acknowledged.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured AST utility library. The only notable feature is the runtime modification of AST classes, which does not constitute malicious activity but could be misused if taken out of context. Overall, the security risk is very low, and the scores are appropriate.",
