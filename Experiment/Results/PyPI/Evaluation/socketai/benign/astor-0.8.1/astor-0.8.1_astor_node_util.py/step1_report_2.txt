{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for inspecting, manipulating, dumping, and comparing Python AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) nodes, primarily for use in code analysis or transformation tools.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from AST node attributes, node lists, and variables via getattr, vars, and list functions. No user input or external data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks such as network I/O, file operations, system commands, or data exfiltration points. It manipulates AST nodes internally without executing or evaluating code.",
  "flows": "The flow involves iterating over AST nodes and attributes, and optionally comparing or dumping AST structures. There are no paths from untrusted input to critical actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden malicious logic. Runtime optimizations and flexible attribute handling are standard. No obfuscation or malicious backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script offers AST utilities for inspection and manipulation, with functions to iterate, dump, strip, compare, and extend AST nodes. It includes a class for custom visiting and a method to enable node comparison via monkey-patching. All functions are standard and do not perform any network or system operations. The code does not handle user input or external data sources, nor does it contain malicious payloads. No signs of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. It appears purely as a code analysis aid with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for AST handling in Python. It does not contain malware or security risks. The absence of network operations, external data handling, or code execution points indicates low malicious potential.",
