{
  "purpose": "Utilities for Python AST manipulation, including tree traversal, dumping, stripping, and comparison functions.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read external input; they operate on provided AST or data structures.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or transmit data, nor does it execute untrusted code or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the functions process AST nodes internally without external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code structure is typical for AST utility libraries. No obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides various functions to iterate, dump, strip, and compare Python ASTs. It includes a class for visiting AST nodes and a monkey-patch function to enable tree comparisons. No parts of the code perform external input/output, network communication, or execute dynamic code. The implementation appears standard for AST handling utilities, with no signs of malicious activity or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility library for AST manipulation, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely on data structures provided by the user and does not interact with external systems or sensitive data.",
