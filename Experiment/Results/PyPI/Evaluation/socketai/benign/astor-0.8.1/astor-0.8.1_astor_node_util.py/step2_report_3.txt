  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core logic, potential security implications, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard AST utility library with functions for traversal, dumping, stripping, and comparison. No external data, no code execution, no network activity. No obfuscation or malicious activity observed.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the benign nature of the code. The scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0—are appropriate. The confidence is high.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the utility nature. Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still consistent. No external data, no malicious behavior. Slight concern about the security risk score (0.2), but justified given the code's potential to modify internal structures.\n\n- **Key Point:** No actual malicious activity, but the code can modify AST classes at runtime (via `allow_ast_comparison`), which could be misused.\n\n- **Assessment:** The low malware score (0) is correct; the security risk score (0.2) is justified because the monkey-patching could interfere with standard behavior if misused.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with an emphasis on the `allow_ast_comparison` function that monkey-patches AST classes to add comparison helpers. The report notes this as potentially suspicious but not malicious.\n\n- **Key Point:** The dynamic modification of core classes is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious.\n\n- **Assessment:** The malware score remains 0, which is correct. The security risk is slightly higher (0.2), justified by the potential for misuse of class modification.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the AST utilities and the class monkey-patching for comparison. No external data, no code execution, no network activity. The dynamic class modification is noted but deemed benign.\n\n- **Assessment:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, aligns with the benign analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar overall conclusion—benign utility functions, no malicious activity, no external data, no obfuscation. The monkey-patching is considered safe and for analysis purposes.\n\n- **Assessment:** The low risk (0.1) and malware=0 are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports agree that there's no malicious code present. The code is purely for AST analysis and manipulation.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero mainly due to the `allow_ast_comparison` function that modifies core classes at runtime. While not malicious, this could be misused or cause unintended side effects if integrated improperly.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — clear, readable utility code.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — primarily due to the runtime modification of AST classes, which could interfere with normal behavior if misused but is not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured utility library for Python AST manipulation. The only potential concern is the dynamic modification of AST classes, which is a known pattern for testing or extending behavior but could pose risks if misused. Overall, the security posture is very low risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2",
