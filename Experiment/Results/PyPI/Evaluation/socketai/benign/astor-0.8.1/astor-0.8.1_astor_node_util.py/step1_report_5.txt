{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for manipulating and analyzing Python AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) structures, including dumping, stripping, and comparing ASTs, as well as a custom node visitor and an AST comparison helper.",
  "sources": "Reads attributes of AST nodes (e.g., _fields, vars(node)), inspects node types, and iterates over node components and lists.",
  "sinks": "No sinks found that process untrusted input data directly, nor are there any network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration routines.",
  "flows": "Data flows from AST node attributes (source) through iteration and inspection functions, with no evidence of untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code includes monkey-patching for AST comparison and utility functions, which are benign. There are no obfuscated segments or dynamic code execution, and no malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly manipulates AST structures for analysis and comparison, with functions for iterating over nodes, dumping tree structures, stripping attributes, and comparing trees efficiently. The monkey-patching function modifies AST classes to support equality comparison, which is safe and intended for testing or analysis purposes. All code operations are limited to in-memory AST processing without external or system-impacting actions. No signs of malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code are evident. The code appears to be a legitimate utility library for AST analysis.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for analyzing Python ASTs with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It focuses on structural manipulation and comparison, suitable for static code analysis or testing.",
