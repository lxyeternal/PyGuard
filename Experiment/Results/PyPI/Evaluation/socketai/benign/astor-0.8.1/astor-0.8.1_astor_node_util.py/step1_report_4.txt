  "purpose": "Utility functions for Python AST manipulation, including tree traversal, dumping, stripping, and comparison.",
  "sources": "Imports 'ast' and 'itertools'; reads attributes of AST nodes; uses list, getattr, vars, hasattr.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no network, file, or environment variable operations; no code execution or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reads data from AST nodes and their attributes; no untrusted data flows to dangerous sinks; mainly internal processing.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic attribute deletion and manipulation of AST node classes; potential for structural modification, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides AST traversal, dumping, stripping, and comparison functions. It includes a monkey-patch to add comparison helpers to AST node classes, enabling tree equality checks. No code injection, network calls, or system manipulation observed. The functions operate solely on AST node objects and their attributes, with no external data or command execution. The dynamic modification of AST classes is a structural convenience, not malicious. Overall, the code appears benign, focusing on AST processing without any malicious intent or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of AST utility functions designed for tree traversal, comparison, and manipulation. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The only notable behavior is dynamic class modification for comparison, which is benign in this context.",
