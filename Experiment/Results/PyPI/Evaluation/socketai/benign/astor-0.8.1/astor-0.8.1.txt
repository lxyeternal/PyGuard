      "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility for reading files relative to the script's directory. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The main security consideration is ensuring that 'parts' are sanitized if derived from untrusted sources to prevent directory traversal. The malware score is correctly zero, and the risk score is appropriately low, with high confidence in the benign assessment."

The only notable feature is the runtime modification of AST classes, which does not constitute malicious activity but could be misused if taken out of context. Overall, the security risk is very low, and the scores are appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard AST traversal utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The potential security concern is minimal and relates to the use of replace() with untrusted input, which is a typical risk in such tools but not indicative of malicious behavior. Overall, the code is safe for use in static analysis or code transformation tasks."

The primary security concern is the eval, which is used only for validation of internally generated strings, making the risk low. Overall, the code is safe, with a moderate security risk score due to eval, but no malware or obfuscation present."
