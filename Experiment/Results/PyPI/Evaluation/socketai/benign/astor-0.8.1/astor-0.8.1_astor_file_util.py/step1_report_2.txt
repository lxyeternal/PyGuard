{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for parsing Python source files into ASTs, finding Python files in a directory tree, and extracting file and line information from code objects. It appears designed for static analysis or code introspection.",
  "sources": "Reads Python source files from filesystem, reads from stdin if a filename is 'stdin', accesses code object attributes for filename and line number information.",
  "sinks": "Uses ast.parse to generate ASTs, reads file contents, writes informational message to stdout when reading from stdin.",
  "flows": "Reads file data via fopen or stdin, processes string content, feeds to ast.parse, accesses code object attributes for file info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward, focusing on static code analysis utilities. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. No obfuscated or malicious code behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for converting code objects into ASTs, with methods for finding Python files in directories, parsing files into ASTs, and extracting filename/line info. It uses standard libraries and well-understood patterns without any suspicious or malicious constructs. The only output is to stdout when reading from stdin, which is benign. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The code’s purpose aligns with static analysis tasks and does not include any potentially harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module for Python static analysis or code introspection. No malicious intent or behavior detected, and no security risks are evident.",
