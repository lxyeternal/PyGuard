{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for parsing Python source files into ASTs, finding Python files in directories, and extracting file and line information from code objects, primarily for static analysis or code manipulation tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads Python source files from disk or stdin, and retrieves code object file and line info.",
  "sinks": "Uses ast.parse on file contents; reads files via open or stdin.",
  "flows": "File input → ast.parse; code object → file/line info extraction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no suspicious file handling beyond standard parsing. All file operations are typical for code analysis tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility module for Python code analysis, including file discovery, parsing source code into ASTs, and extracting source location info from code objects. It uses standard libraries (ast, os, sys) and performs straightforward file I/O operations. There are no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The functions are well-documented and align with typical static analysis workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for AST parsing and source code analysis, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It adheres to standard practices for code inspection tools and does not include any malicious payloads or suspicious operations.",
