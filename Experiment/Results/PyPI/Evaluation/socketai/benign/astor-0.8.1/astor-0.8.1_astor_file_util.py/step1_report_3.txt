{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for parsing Python files into ASTs, finding Python files in directories, and extracting file and line info from code objects, primarily for static analysis or manipulation of Python code.",
  "sources": "Reads Python source files from filesystem using 'os.walk' and 'fopen', and reads code objects' '__file__' attribute for metadata.",
  "sinks": "AST parsing does not involve dangerous sinks; file reading uses standard 'open' or 'tokenize.open', which are safe. No untrusted data is written or executed.",
  "flows": "Filesystem input (Python files) flows into 'parse_file' for AST parsing; code object metadata flows into 'get_file_info'. No network or external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are detected. The code includes standard filesystem and AST manipulation functionalities with no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard static analysis utility functions: finding Python files, parsing files into ASTs, and retrieving source info from code objects. No malicious behaviors such as code injection, data exfiltration, or network activity are present. Use of 'ast' and file operations are safe and typical for such tools. No obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign utility for Python static analysis and code introspection. No signs of malware or malicious intent are identified. It adheres to safe coding practices without security risks.",
