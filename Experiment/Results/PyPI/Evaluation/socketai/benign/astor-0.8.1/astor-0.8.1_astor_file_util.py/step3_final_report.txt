{
  "purpose": "Provides utilities for parsing Python files into ASTs, finding Python files in directories, and extracting filename and line number info from code objects.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads (open/read files), code object attributes (__file__, __code__, co_filename, co_firstlineno)",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing leading to data leaks or system effects",
  "flows": "File reading flows into ast.parse; code object info flows into get_file_info; no external or untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward use of standard libraries; no obfuscation or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility module for static analysis tasks, including file discovery, parsing, and code object info extraction. It uses safe practices such as context managers for file handling, and no network, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The functions perform typical filesystem and AST operations without processing untrusted data in a dangerous manner. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. The code's behavior aligns with benign static analysis tooling, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for static analysis of Python code, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0. The assessments are consistent with the code's functionality.",
