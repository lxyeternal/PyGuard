  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is a benign utility for AST manipulation, file discovery, and code object info extraction. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code is detected.\n- **Findings:** The code uses standard libraries (`ast`, `os`, `sys`, `tokenize`) for filesystem and AST operations. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Justification:** The reasoning aligns with the code's functionality. The code is purely utility-focused, with no network, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is described as a static analysis utility with safe practices.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no external communications, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is consistent with the code, which is straightforward and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a benign static analysis utility, with no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** Uses standard file operations, no suspicious logic, no network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** The code is standard, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; the code is a utility for static analysis, safe practices.\n- **Findings:** No malicious or suspicious behaviors, standard file handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning aligns with the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign utility module for AST parsing and file handling.\n- **Findings:** Uses safe, standard practices, no network, no malicious payloads.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** The assessment is consistent with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports correctly identify the code as a standard utility for static analysis, with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors.\n- **Scores:** All malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are appropriately set to 0.\n- **Confidence:** All reports have high confidence (1), which is justified given the code's straightforward nature.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code's functionality and security posture.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured utility for Python static analysis, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The provided reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
