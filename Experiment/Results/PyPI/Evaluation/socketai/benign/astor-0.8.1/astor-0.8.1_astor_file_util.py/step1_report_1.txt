  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for parsing Python files into ASTs, locating Python source files in a directory, and extracting file/line information from code objects.",
  "sources": "File reading operations using 'fopen' or 'open' for reading Python source files, 'os.walk' for directory traversal, and access to code object attributes for file info.",
  "sinks": "AST parsing with 'ast.parse', file reading buffers, and code object attribute access. No untrusted data processing beyond file reading.",
  "flows": "Reading files from disk -> parsing content into AST -> caching results -> retrieving file/line info from code objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. Usage of standard library functions for filesystem operations and AST parsing is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility for static code analysis tasks involving Python ASTs and file operations. It reads Python files, parses them into ASTs, and caches results for efficiency. The methods involve safe file handling, directory traversal, and standard AST operations without any suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no external network communications, obfuscated code, or backdoors. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for AST manipulation and source file management. There are no malicious or suspicious behaviors present, and the code uses standard, safe practices for file handling and AST parsing.",
