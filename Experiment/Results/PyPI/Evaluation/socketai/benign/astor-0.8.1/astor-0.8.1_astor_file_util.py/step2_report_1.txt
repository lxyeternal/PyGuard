  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**General observations about the code:**\n- It provides utilities for:\n  - Finding Python files in directories (`find_py_files`)\n  - Parsing Python files into ASTs (`parse_file`)\n  - Extracting filename and line number info from code objects (`get_file_info`)\n- Uses standard Python libraries (`ast`, `os`, `sys`, `tokenize`)\n- Reads files safely, with fallback to stdin\n- Implements caching for efficiency\n- No network activity, no code execution, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets\n- All operations are typical for static analysis or code introspection tools\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior evident\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard utility for parsing and source file management. Correct.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Accurately describes safe filesystem and AST operations.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious behavior.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Correctly identifies the code as benign, standard, and safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, for static analysis.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Correctly notes safe file reading and code object attribute access.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Appropriately describes the code as benign and safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, for static analysis.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Correctly notes safe file operations and code object info retrieval.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious activity.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Correctly states benign nature.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Accurate.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious behavior.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Correctly identifies as benign utility code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Accurate.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Correctly describes the code as safe and standard.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence of malicious or suspicious behavior:** None.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Malware:** None.\n- **Security risk:** None.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a straightforward utility module for static code analysis, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign and free of malicious or suspicious activity. The scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
