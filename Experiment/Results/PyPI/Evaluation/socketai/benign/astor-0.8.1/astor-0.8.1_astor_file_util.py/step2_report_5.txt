  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a utility module for parsing Python files into ASTs, locating Python files in directories, and extracting file/line info from code objects.\n- It uses standard libraries (`ast`, `os`, `sys`, `tokenize`) with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- File operations are straightforward, with safe practices like context managers.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present.\n- The purpose aligns with static analysis or code introspection, not execution or dynamic behavior.\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which appears appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:**  \n  The code appears syntactically correct and functionally consistent with its described purpose. No issues are evident in the logic or implementation.\n\n- **Malicious behavior or vulnerabilities:**  \n  No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious code. The functions handle files safely, and no external or untrusted data is processed in a dangerous manner.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  The code is straightforward, well-documented, and uses standard practices. No obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Security risk:**  \n  The code is a benign utility, with no evident security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Confidence:**  \n  All reports show high confidence (1), which aligns with the clear and standard nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Flow and logic:**  \n  The functions perform standard filesystem traversal, file reading, AST parsing, and code object info extraction.  \n- **Potential assumptions:**  \n  No assumptions about malicious intent are made; the analysis is consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe utility for static analysis, with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
