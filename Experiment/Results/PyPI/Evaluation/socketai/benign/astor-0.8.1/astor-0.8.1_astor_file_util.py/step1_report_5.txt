{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for parsing Python files into ASTs, finding Python files in a directory, and extracting file and line information from code objects.",
  "sources": "Reads Python source files from disk via 'open' or 'fopen', and reads from stdin if needed.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data, send data over networks, or execute untrusted code directly. It mainly reads files and parses them into ASTs.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> replaces line endings -> appends newline -> parses into AST; also retrieves file and line info from code objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs standard filesystem and AST operations without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, defines a class for handling AST extraction from Python files, and provides utility methods for file discovery, parsing, and code object info retrieval. The methods use safe practices like context managers for file reading. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are present. All operations are typical for a static analysis or code introspection library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage, and the code appears well-structured for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for AST parsing and file handling, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
