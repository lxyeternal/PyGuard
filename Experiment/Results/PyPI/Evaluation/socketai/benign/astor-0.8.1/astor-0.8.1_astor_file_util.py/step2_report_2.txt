  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a utility module for static analysis: parsing Python files into ASTs, finding files, and extracting source info from code objects.\n- It uses standard libraries (`ast`, `os`, `sys`, `tokenize`) and typical patterns.\n- No network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- File handling uses safe practices, such as context managers.\n- The code does not process untrusted data beyond reading files, nor does it write or execute code based on untrusted input.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. This aligns with the code analysis.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No significant errors or flaws are identified. The code appears well-structured, with proper handling of file reading, directory traversal, and code object info extraction.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not contain malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n### Any discrepancies or points to challenge?\n\n- The reports are consistent and thorough. They correctly identify the code as a utility for static analysis with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard, safe utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a safe, standard utility for Python static analysis. All reports are accurate and justified in their assessments. No modifications needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No security concerns. The code can be considered safe with a malware, obfuscated, and risk score of 0.",
