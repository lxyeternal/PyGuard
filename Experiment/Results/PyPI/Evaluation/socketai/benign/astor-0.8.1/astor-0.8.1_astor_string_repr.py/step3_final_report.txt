  "purpose": "Utility functions for pretty-printing strings, handling unicode, bytes, and generating triple-quoted string representations with validation via eval.",
  "sources": "String input 's', internal string processing functions, regex splitting, and string literal generation.",
  "sinks": "Eval used on generated string literals for validation purposes.",
  "flows": "Input 's' -> string processing -> string_triplequote_repr -> eval to verify correctness.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval on internally generated string literals; no external input execution or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides string formatting utilities, including handling unicode and bytes, escaping characters, and creating triple-quoted strings. Eval is used solely to verify that the generated string literal accurately represents the original string, not to execute arbitrary code. No malicious code, backdoors, or network activity are present. The eval usage, while generally safe here, could pose a risk if 's' is maliciously crafted, but in typical controlled contexts, this risk is minimal. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for string representation with controlled eval usage. No malware or malicious intent detected. The primary security concern is the eval, which is used only for validation of internally generated strings, making the risk low. Overall, the code is safe, with a moderate security risk score due to eval, but no malware or obfuscation present.",
