{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning regarding the usage of 'astor.codegen' module and advises to use 'astor.code_gen' instead.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports a module and issues a warning.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present as there is no processing of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs; the code only performs import and warning functions.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement uses a wildcard which can make static analysis harder, but it's common practice. No other unusual behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from the 'code_gen' module within the current package. It then issues a deprecation warning indicating that 'astor.codegen' is deprecated and should be replaced with 'astor.code_gen'. There are no suspicious or malicious operations, no data processing, no external inputs, or outputs. The use of a wildcard import may be considered bad practice but is not malicious. The warning is standard for deprecated modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, performing an import and issuing a deprecation warning. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The purpose is solely to inform developers about the deprecation status of a module.",
