{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning for the 'astor.codegen' module and imports all contents from a local 'code_gen' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'warnings' module and imports from '.code_gen'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing a module and issuing a warning, with no data flow from external untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a wildcard import ('*'), which can obscure imported content and potentially hide malicious or unintended code. The warning indicates deprecation, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard 'warnings' module and a local module 'code_gen'. It then issues a deprecation warning advising to use 'astor.code_gen' instead of 'astor.codegen'. The use of 'import *' can be risky in general, but in this context, it appears to be a benign code organization practice. No untrusted input, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is observed. The warning indicates maintenance or transition in module usage but does not suggest malicious intent or activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a transitional import with a deprecation warning. The wildcard import is potentially risky but not malicious in this context. Overall, there is no evidence of malware or malicious activity.",
