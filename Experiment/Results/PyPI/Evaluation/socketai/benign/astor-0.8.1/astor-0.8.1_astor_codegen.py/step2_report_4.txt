  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code's purpose is solely to import a module and issue a deprecation warning.\n- No external input, network activity, or data processing occurs.\n- The import uses a wildcard (`from .code_gen import *`), which is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n- The warning message is standard for deprecation notices.\n- No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are present.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The security risk scores are very low, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies the code's purpose.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Appropriately states there's no malicious intent; minor concern about wildcard import.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — appropriate given the straightforwardness.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to Report 1; emphasizes benign nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0 — consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly notes the minimal code and no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — high, given the simplicity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above; straightforward deprecation warning.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0 — consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to others; highlights the wildcard import as a minor concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1 — acceptable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — suitable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all, as the code is transparent.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code, with minor concern about wildcard import.\n\n### **Potential adjustments:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The only point of contention is the wildcard import, which could be flagged as a minor security concern. However, since it's common in internal modules and there's no malicious activity, a small security risk score (e.g., 0.1) is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (consistent with minor concern about wildcard import, but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The scores reflect the benign purpose of the code, with minor concerns about the import style. No evidence suggests malicious intent or activity.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's actual behavior.",
