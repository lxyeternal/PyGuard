{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning related to the 'astor.codegen' module, advising users to import 'astor.code_gen' instead.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports a local module and issues a warning.",
  "sinks": "The warning message is output to standard error, which is typical for deprecation notices.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the flow is only a warning message.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a deprecation warning without additional malicious or suspicious code is standard; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a local module, possibly for code generation purposes. It then issues a DeprecationWarning informing users that 'astor.codegen' is deprecated. The warning is issued with a specific stack level. No external data input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a typical maintenance or backward-compatibility notice, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign deprecation warning indicating that a specific module is outdated. There is no malicious behavior or security concern detected. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code seems to serve a maintenance purpose.",
