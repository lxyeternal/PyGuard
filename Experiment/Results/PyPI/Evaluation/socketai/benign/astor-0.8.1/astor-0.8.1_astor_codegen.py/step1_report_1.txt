{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning regarding the 'astor.codegen' module and encourages the use of 'astor.code_gen' instead.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .code_gen import *' which loads all public objects from the local 'code_gen' module.",
  "sinks": "The warning function 'warnings.warn' which displays a deprecation warning message.",
  "flows": "The import statement loads code from the local module; the warning function outputs a message to the user.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import 'import *' which can obscure which objects are imported; no suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages deprecation messaging by importing from a local module and issuing a warning to inform users of deprecation. The import uses a wildcard, which is generally discouraged due to potential namespace pollution, but does not directly indicate malicious activity. The warning message is standard for deprecation notices. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code does not process user input or interact with external data sources, reducing the likelihood of data leaks or injection vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves a simple purpose of deprecation notification with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The use of a wildcard import is a minor concern but does not indicate malicious activity.",
