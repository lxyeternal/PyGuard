  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  The report correctly identifies the import statement `from .code_gen import *` and the warning function `warnings.warn`. No malicious code or suspicious behavior is present.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  The report emphasizes the use of `import *` as a minor concern but not malicious. This is accurate; wildcard imports are discouraged but not inherently dangerous.\n\n- **Score appropriateness:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct, no malicious activity.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct, code is straightforward.  \n  - Security risk: 0.1 — minor concern due to wildcard import, which is acceptable here.\n\n- **Justification for risk score:**  \n  The small risk score of 0.1 is reasonable; the wildcard import could cause namespace pollution but isn't malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  Same as above; no malicious activity, just a minimal deprecation warning.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  The reasoning is sound; no suspicious logic.\n\n- **Score appropriateness:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security risk: 0 — appropriate, as no real security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  Same conclusion; no malicious code, just a deprecation warning and import.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  No, the analysis is consistent.\n\n- **Score appropriateness:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security risk: 0 — accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  Again, no malicious activity. The report notes the use of `import *` but considers it benign.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  The reasoning is consistent; no malicious activity.\n\n- **Score appropriateness:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security risk: 0 — acceptable, given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  Same as others; no malicious code, just a deprecation warning and wildcard import.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  The report appropriately notes the potential risk of `import *` but clarifies it’s not malicious here.\n\n- **Score appropriateness:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security risk: 0.1 — acceptable minor concern.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly varied, mostly 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the minimal concerns about wildcard import and deprecation warnings.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious intent or code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minor concern due to wildcard import, but not enough to consider a significant security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The scores reflect the benign nature of the code, which primarily serves as a deprecation warning with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor security concern about the wildcard import is appropriately acknowledged but does not elevate the risk significantly.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed; the assessments are reasonable and aligned with the code's actual behavior.",
