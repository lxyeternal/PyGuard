  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code's purpose is to issue a deprecation warning about 'astor.codegen' and recommend using 'astor.code_gen'.\n- It imports from a local module using a wildcard import, which is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n- No external data, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- All reports conclude that there is no malicious activity or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Presence of issues:** The code matches the description; no discrepancies.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Use of `import *` is discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 seem appropriate; the small risk is due to wildcard import.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as benign with minor concern about import style.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Presence of issues:** The code matches; no discrepancies.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious behavior; the code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0; appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Presence of issues:** The code matches; no issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No malicious activity; the wildcard import is noted but benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0; consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Presence of issues:** Matches; no discrepancies.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0; appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Presence of issues:** Matches; no issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.1; consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is primarily for deprecation warning purposes.\n- The only minor concern is the use of `import *`, which is flagged as a potential risk but not malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n**Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (minor concern due to wildcard import, but overall benign)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nThe code is a simple, benign deprecation notification with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The minor risk score reflects the use of wildcard import, which is a best practice concern but not a security issue.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the existing assessments and the detailed analysis.",
