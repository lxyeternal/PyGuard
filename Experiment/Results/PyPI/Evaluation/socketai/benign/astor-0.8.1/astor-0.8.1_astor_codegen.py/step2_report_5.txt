  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as performing a simple import from a local module and issuing a deprecation warning.\n- The import uses a wildcard (`from .code_gen import *`), which is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious.\n- No external data inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The purpose appears to be maintenance-related: informing users of deprecated modules.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code's functionality matches the description: import and warning.\n- No discrepancies or evidence of malicious activity.\n- The use of `import *` is a minor concern but not a security risk per se.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The main flaw is the use of a wildcard import, which can lead to namespace pollution and maintenance difficulties. However, this is a coding style issue, not a security flaw.\n- No other errors or malicious code are present.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Very low, approximately 0.1, primarily due to the wildcard import, which can be considered a minor security concern but not a real risk here.\n- **Overall Risk Score:** Given the above, a score around 0.1–0.2 seems appropriate, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n- The reports correctly assume the code's purpose is deprecation notification.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are justified; the evidence supports benign maintenance code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|--------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No signs of malicious activity or payloads.                                |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Code is clear and straightforward.                                           |\n| Security Risk      | 0.1–0.2 | Minor concern due to wildcard import, but no real security threat.        |\n\n**Overall, I would rate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\nThe code is benign, serves a maintenance purpose, and does not pose security risks. The only minor concern is the wildcard import, which should be replaced with explicit imports for better coding practices but does not constitute a security issue.",
