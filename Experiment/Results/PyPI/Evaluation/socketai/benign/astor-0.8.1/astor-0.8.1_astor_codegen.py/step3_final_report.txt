  "purpose": "To import the 'code_gen' module from the current package and issue a deprecation warning advising to use 'astor.code_gen' instead.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .code_gen import *' and the 'warnings.warn' call.",
  "sinks": "The warning message output to the user.",
  "flows": "Import from local module -> issuing deprecation warning.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('import *'), which is discouraged but not malicious; no dynamic code execution or external data sources.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import and issues a deprecation warning. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The wildcard import is a coding style concern but not a security threat. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are detected. The minimal code and warning serve a maintenance purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for deprecation notification, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The minor security concern about the wildcard import does not constitute a real threat. The overall assessment aligns with the reports, confirming the code's safety.",
