{
  "purpose": "This code issues a deprecation warning for the 'astor.codegen' module and suggests using 'astor.code_gen' instead.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the imported module '.code_gen' and from the 'warnings.warn' function call.",
  "sinks": "The 'warnings.warn' call outputs a warning message; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports a module and then issues a warning message to the user.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, with no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The import uses a relative path, but this is common in package internal code. No hardcoded secrets or malicious activity are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports a module and issues a deprecation warning indicating that 'astor.codegen' is deprecated. The import statement includes a wildcard import, which can sometimes hide unnecessary or unintended imports but is not inherently malicious. The warning informs users to switch to 'astor.code_gen'. There are no data flows from untrusted sources, no network operations, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and appears to be a simple deprecation notice within a package.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this code. It functions solely to notify users about a deprecated module. The code is benign and serves a maintenance purpose.",
