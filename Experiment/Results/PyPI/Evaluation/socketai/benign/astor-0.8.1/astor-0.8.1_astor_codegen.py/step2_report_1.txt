  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code to identify any discrepancies, potential risks, or inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The core code is minimal: it imports from a local module and issues a deprecation warning.\n- No external data, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The import uses a wildcard (`from .code_gen import *`), which is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n- The warning message is standard for deprecation notices.\n- No signs of obfuscated code, malware, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose:** Correctly states the code issues a deprecation warning.\n- **Sources:** The import statement and `warnings.warn`.\n- **Sinks:** The warning output.\n- **Flow:** Import and warning.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `import *` is discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, aligning with the benign analysis.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected. The minimal risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2 Analysis**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the deprecation warning.\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; only a minimal concern about relative import.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, consistent with benign intent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3 Analysis**\n\n- Reinforces the deprecation warning.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4 Analysis**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on the warning message.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, matching the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5 Analysis**\n\n- Notes the wildcard import and deprecation warning.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, security risk is 0.1. The latter is slightly elevated but still very low.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The minor security risk score of 0.1 reflects the potential concern about `import *`, which is a known best practice violation but not malicious. This is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Final Judgment**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code matches all reports; no discrepancies.\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Score:** The highest is 0.1, mainly due to the wildcard import, which is a minor concern but not a security threat.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — due to the wildcard import, which is a code quality concern but not security-critical.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is benign, serves a maintenance purpose, and the scores across reports are reasonable and consistent with the actual code behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Recommendations:**\n\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No changes necessary.\n- The deprecation warning and import style do not introduce security risks.\n\n**Final notes:** The code is a simple, non-malicious deprecation notice with no security implications.",
