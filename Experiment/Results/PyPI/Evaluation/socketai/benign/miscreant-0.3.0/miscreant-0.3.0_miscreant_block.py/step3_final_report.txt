  "purpose": "Implementation of a 128-bit AES block with cryptographic operations including doubling in GF(2^128), encryption, copying, cloning, and XOR.",
  "sources": "Data initialized in constructor, external cipher object during encryption, input to xor_in_place method.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted data written back to self.data, XOR operation modifies self.data in place.",
  "flows": "Input data -> internal data storage; external cipher -> encrypt method -> encrypted data; XOR input -> self.data via xor_in_place.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; use of ct.select appears standard for polynomial reduction.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements AES block operations with proper validation. GF(2^128) doubling is accurately handled with polynomial reduction using ct.select. Encryption relies on an external cipher object, which is standard. No malicious or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is clear, well-structured, and follows cryptographic best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard cryptographic utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. External dependencies appear legitimate. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is zero. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
