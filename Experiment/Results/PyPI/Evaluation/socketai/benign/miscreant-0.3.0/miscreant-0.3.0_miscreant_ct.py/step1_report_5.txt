  "purpose": "Implement a constant-time selection function for cryptographic operations to avoid timing attacks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'subject', 'result_if_one', 'result_if_zero'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement applying bitwise operations; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'subject' influences the selection logic, combining 'result_if_one' and 'result_if_zero' based on 'subject'.",
  "anomalies": "The code comments note that pure Python is not truly suitable for constant-time cryptography, which is standard. No suspicious code patterns or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The function uses bitwise operations to perform a selection based on 'subject' in a manner aiming for constant-time behavior to prevent timing attacks. It relies solely on safe, basic Python bitwise operators without external data access or suspicious behavior. No anomalies or malicious intent are evident. The code appears to serve a legitimate cryptographic purpose, with an awareness of its limitations stated in comments.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard constant-time selection function intended for cryptographic use. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The comments acknowledge the limitations of Python for true constant-time implementations, indicating responsible coding practices.",
