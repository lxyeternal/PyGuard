  "purpose": "Implement a constant-time selection function to mitigate timing side-channel attacks in cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'subject', 'result_if_one', 'result_if_zero' used in bitwise operations.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; the function operates purely on input parameters.",
  "flows": "The 'subject' parameter influences the selection between 'result_if_one' and 'result_if_zero' via bitwise masking.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with comments acknowledging Python's limitations for true constant-time guarantees.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard bitwise selection based on 'subject', assuming it is 0 or 1. It uses common cryptographic pattern to avoid branches, with comments indicating awareness of Python's limitations. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a constant-time select function suitable for cryptographic contexts within Python's constraints. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The low security risk score is justified by the known limitations of Python for true constant-time guarantees, but overall, the code is safe and appropriate.",
