  "purpose": "Implementing a constant-time selection function to avoid timing attacks in cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: subject, result_if_one, result_if_zero",
  "sinks": "Return statement applying bitwise operations based on subject, which could influence control flow or data flow in cryptographic contexts.",
  "flows": "Input 'subject' influences the bitwise operations that determine which result is returned, potentially affecting security-sensitive decision logic.",
  "anomalies": "The function appears to be a standard constant-time selection pattern; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. The comment warns about limitations of pure Python for cryptographic security but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function for constant-time selection between two results based on a 'subject' value. It uses bitwise operations to avoid branching, which is typical in cryptographic code to prevent timing attacks. The comment explicitly states that pure Python is not ideal for true cryptographic constant-time operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as backdoors or data exfiltration. The implementation appears straightforward and aligned with common cryptographic patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of a constant-time selection function intended for cryptographic purposes. There are no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage. The comment indicates awareness of the limitations of Python for secure cryptography but does not suggest malicious activity.",
