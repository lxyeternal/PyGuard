  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a constant-time select function suitable for cryptographic contexts within Python's constraints. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The low security risk score is justified by the known limitations of Python for true constant-time guarantees, but overall, the code is safe and appropriate."
