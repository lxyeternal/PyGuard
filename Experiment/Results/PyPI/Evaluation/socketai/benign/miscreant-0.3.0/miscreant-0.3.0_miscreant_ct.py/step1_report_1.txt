{
  "purpose": "Implement a constant-time selection function to avoid timing side-channel attacks in cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'subject' which determines the selection, and 'result_if_one' and 'result_if_zero' which are the possible outputs based on the 'subject'.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a value based on bitwise operations; no external sinks are directly affected.",
  "flows": "The value of 'subject' influences which of 'result_if_one' or 'result_if_zero' is returned, via bitwise masking.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a constant-time select function; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The function performs a bitwise selection based on the 'subject' value, intended to mitigate timing attacks by avoiding branches. The operation is standard in cryptography for secure conditional selection. The code is minimal, clear, and adheres to cryptographic best practices for constant-time operations. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a standard, benign implementation of a constant-time select function used in cryptography. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. It serves a legitimate purpose in cryptographic contexts.",
