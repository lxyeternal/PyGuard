  "purpose": "Implementing a constant-time selection function, likely for cryptographic purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: subject, result_if_one, result_if_zero",
  "sinks": "Return statement that combines values based on bitwise operations; no external data sinks observed",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence the output through bitwise manipulations; no external data flows detected",
  "anomalies": "Code uses bitwise operations to avoid branching, which is typical in cryptography; no suspicious or malicious anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The function aims to perform a constant-time selection between two results based on the 'subject' parameter. It uses bitwise operations (~, &, |) to avoid branches that could leak information via timing attacks. The implementation is straightforward and typical for cryptographic code. No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, or other malicious indicators are present. The comment and warning indicate awareness of cryptography limitations in pure Python but do not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of a constant-time select function used in cryptography to prevent timing side-channel attacks. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
