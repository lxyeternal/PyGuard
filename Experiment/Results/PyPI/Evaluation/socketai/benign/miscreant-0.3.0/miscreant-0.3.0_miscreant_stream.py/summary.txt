  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, correct, and secure implementation of a streaming AEAD encryption scheme with proper nonce management. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
