  "purpose": "Implementing a streaming authenticated encryption scheme using AEAD construction with nonce management.",
  "sources": "Input data: plaintext, associated_data, nonce; Data reading occurs in method parameters and initializations.",
  "sinks": "Encryption and decryption via self.aead.seal and self.aead.open, which handle cryptographic operations.",
  "flows": "plaintext and associated_data flow into encryption methods, nonce generated by NonceEncoder flows into AEAD functions for encryption/decryption.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; proper type and value checks for nonce; nonce construction uses standard pack with no obfuscation; no hardcoded secrets or credentials found.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a streaming encryption/decryption mechanism using AEAD with nonce management. NonceEncoder manages nonce construction with checks for correct type and length. The flow from input parameters to cryptographic functions appears standard. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected, such as network activity, backdoors, or data leaks. The code seems to follow expected cryptographic patterns and includes appropriate error handling for nonce overflows and type errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard, straightforward streaming encryption scheme with proper nonce handling. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are present. It appears secure and benign based on the provided code.",
