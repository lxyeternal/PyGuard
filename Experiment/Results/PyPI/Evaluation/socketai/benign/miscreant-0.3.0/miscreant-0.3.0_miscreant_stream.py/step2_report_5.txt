  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their findings with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements a STREAM construction for authenticated encryption using an AEAD primitive.\n- Manages nonces via `NonceEncoder`, which combines a nonce prefix, a counter, and a last-block flag.\n- Validates nonce size and type.\n- Handles stream termination and counter overflow via exceptions.\n- Uses standard cryptographic practices, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- Proper nonce size validation (`len(nonce_prefix) == 8`)\n- Type validation for nonce (`isinstance(nonce_prefix, bytes)`)\n- Counter overflow check (`self.counter >= COUNTER_MAX`)\n- Handling of stream termination (`self.finished` flag)\n- Use of exceptions (`FinishedError`, `OverflowError`) for control flow, which is standard in cryptographic implementations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- No suspicious network activity or data leaks.\n\n**Overall, the code appears to be a standard, correct implementation of a streaming AEAD scheme.**\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Implementation of online AEAD with nonce management.\n- Findings: No suspicious code, proper validation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No issues found. The risk score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Streaming AEAD with nonce management.\n- Findings: No anomalies, proper validation, no suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: STREAM AEAD with nonce management.\n- Findings: No hardcoded secrets, proper validation, no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: STREAM encryption with counter-based nonce.\n- Findings: No suspicious code, proper validation, standard pattern.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as standard and benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: STREAM AEAD with nonce management.\n- Findings: No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious activity, proper validation.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior. No suspicious network activity, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports are 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0.2, which seems reasonable given the cryptographic context and proper validation.\n\n**However,** considering the importance of nonce management in cryptography, any flaw here could be critical. The code is well-structured, with standard practices, and no vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (low, given the correct implementation and validation)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe code appears secure, well-implemented, and free from malicious intent. The minor risk score reflects the inherent cryptographic reliance on correct implementation and validation, which is present here.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Value |\n|-----------------|--------------|\n| Malware         | 0            |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2          |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, secure implementation of a streaming AEAD encryption scheme with proper nonce management. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present.",
