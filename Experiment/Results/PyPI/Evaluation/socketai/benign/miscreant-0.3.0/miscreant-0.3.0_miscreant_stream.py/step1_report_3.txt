{
  "purpose": "Implementation of an authenticated encryption stream cipher based on the STREAM construction, providing encryption and decryption with nonce management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to constructors (nonce, key, algorithm), method parameters (plaintext, ciphertext, associated_data, last_block), and the nonce_prefix during NonceEncoder initialization.",
  "sinks": "AEAD's seal and open methods which perform encryption/decryption, nonce generation in NonceEncoder.next, and potential exceptions thrown during nonce management.",
  "flows": "Nonce prefix provided during initialization flows into NonceEncoder.next to generate nonces for AEAD operations; plaintext/ciphertext flows into AEAD.seal and AEAD.open with generated nonces; last_block flag influences nonce generation and stream termination.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external network calls, or backdoors. Proper nonce size validation and exception handling. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The only potential concern is exception usage for control flow, but that is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard stream encryption/decryption mechanism with proper nonce management and bounds checking. It validates nonce input type and size, handles stream completion and overflow conditions, and delegates cryptographic operations to an AEAD object. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to follow secure practices for streaming encryption and nonce management without suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a streaming AEAD encryption scheme with appropriate validation and exception handling. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident. The design aligns with standard cryptographic practices.",
