  "purpose": "Implementation of an online authenticated encryption scheme using the STREAM construction, providing encryption and decryption with nonce management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: nonce_prefix in NonceEncoder, plaintext and associated_data in seal, ciphertext and associated_data in open",
  "sinks": "AEAD's seal and open methods (potential data encryption/decryption), exceptions raised during nonce handling",
  "flows": "NonceEncoder.next receives last_block flag -> encodes nonce with prefix, counter, and flag -> AEAD.seal/open processes data using generated nonce",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Proper nonce size validation and counter overflow check. Use of exceptions for flow control is standard. No unexpected code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard STREAM construction with nonce encoding based on a prefix, counter, and last block flag. It uses an AEAD scheme for encryption/decryption, managing nonces securely. The only input validation involves nonce size and type. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are observed. The code appears well-structured, with appropriate exception handling for nonce overflow and finished stream state. No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of STREAM encryption with nonce management, showing no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs its intended cryptographic function securely, assuming the AEAD implementation is sound.",
