  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'miscreant' cryptography library, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Configuration data for package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery; no external input reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script with no obfuscated code or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and defines package setup parameters such as name, version, description, author info, URL, package inclusion, dependencies, and classifiers. It follows typical Python package setup conventions without any code execution beyond static configuration. No external inputs, environment variable manipulations, or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup configuration script for packaging a cryptography library. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present.",
