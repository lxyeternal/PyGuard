  "sources": "Reads static package metadata, dependencies, and package data; no input or external data reading detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; purely static configuration for package setup.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion. No external input, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. All code is static and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent, no anomalous behavior, and no security risks detected.",
