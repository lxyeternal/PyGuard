{
  "purpose": "This script defines the setup configuration for packaging the 'miscreant' Python library, including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data such as package name, version, description, author info, URLs, and dependencies from predefined variables and function calls.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed; the script solely contains setup metadata.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading static configuration data and passing it to the setup() function, with no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard setup conventions without obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It includes no user input processing, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. The dependencies specified are cryptography libraries, which are common for security-related packages. There are no hardcoded credentials or other security issues identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides package metadata and dependency information for the 'miscreant' cryptography library.",
