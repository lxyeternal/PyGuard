  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'miscreant' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external data processing is occurring.",
  "flows": "The script flows from importing setup tools to configuring and executing package setup with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and configuration details. All data appears to be static and intended for package distribution. No inputs from external sources, no untrusted data handling, or code execution paths that could be malicious are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a conventional package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
