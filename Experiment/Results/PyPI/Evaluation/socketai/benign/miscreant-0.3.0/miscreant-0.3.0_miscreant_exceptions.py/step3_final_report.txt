  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for cryptographic error handling within the Miscreant library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for CryptoError, IntegrityError, OverflowError, and FinishedError.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Redefinition of built-in OverflowError class shadows the standard exception, which could cause confusion but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, serving as error indicators. No input/output, data processing, or external communication occurs. The only notable point is the shadowing of Python's built-in OverflowError, which may lead to confusion or bugs but does not introduce security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The overall assessment confirms no malicious activity or security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and purely structural, defining exception classes for cryptographic error handling. The shadowing of OverflowError is a minor concern but does not constitute malicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
