  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for defining exception classes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign and purely structural.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The only minor point is the mention that redefining `OverflowError` (which shadows a built-in exception) could cause slight confusion, but this is not malicious.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward analysis.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions for exceptions with no malicious activity, scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted.\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0.\n   - The overall security risk is correctly identified as 0.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code's simplicity.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code's nature.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is benign, straightforward, and standard for defining custom exceptions. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
