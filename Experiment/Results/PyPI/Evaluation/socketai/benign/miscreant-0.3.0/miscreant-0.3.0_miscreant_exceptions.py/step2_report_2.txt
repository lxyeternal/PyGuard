  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the original code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions used in cryptographic operations.\n   - No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code is benign and purely structural.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is simple, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n   - Report 5 notes that `OverflowError` shadows a built-in exception, which could cause confusion but isn't malicious.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the findings.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - The confidence levels are 1 across all reports, which seems reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any behavior that would warrant a higher risk score.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, data handling, or external communication.\n   - The only minor concern is the redefinition of `OverflowError`, which could be confusing but not risky.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports agree on a malware score of 0, which is justified.\n   - The code contains no malicious activity or backdoors.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions about Vulnerabilities:**\n   - The assumption that defining exception classes is harmless is correct.\n   - No vulnerabilities are implied or suggested by the code.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The only minor point is the redefinition of `OverflowError`, which could cause confusion but is not malicious. If anything, it could be flagged as a potential source of bugs or confusion in a broader codebase, but not as a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and well-understood. The scores assigned are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across all reports.",
