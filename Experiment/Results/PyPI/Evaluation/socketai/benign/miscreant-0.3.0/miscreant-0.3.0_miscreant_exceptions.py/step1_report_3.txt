  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for cryptography-related errors in the Miscreant project",
  "sources": "None; this code does not read input or data",
  "sinks": "None; this code does not write data or interact with external systems",
  "flows": "No data flows present; exception classes are for error handling only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions. CryptoError and IntegrityError are domain-specific, related to cryptography, while OverflowError and FinishedError are general. No code execution, data handling, or external interactions are present. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely establishes custom exception classes for cryptographic error handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
