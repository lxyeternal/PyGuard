{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for cryptography-related errors and general overflow/error conditions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reads; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code solely defines exception classes without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a hierarchy of custom exception classes for cryptographic and stream-related errors. It includes CryptoError and IntegrityError for cryptography, and OverflowError and FinishedError for control flow or state management. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and serves as error handling support.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is purely definitional, establishing exception classes for error handling. There are no malicious elements or security risks present.",
