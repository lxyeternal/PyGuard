  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for cryptography-related errors used by the Miscreant library",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; only class definitions and exception handling",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; only exception class declarations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception classes. These serve as error indicators for cryptographic operations within the Miscreant library. No input/output, network, or data processing occurs, and there are no signs of malicious activity or backdoors. The code appears straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
