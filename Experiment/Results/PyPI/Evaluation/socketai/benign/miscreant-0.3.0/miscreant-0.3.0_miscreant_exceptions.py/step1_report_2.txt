{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for cryptography-related errors in the Miscreant project",
  "sources": "No input data reading; exception class definitions are static",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flows from untrusted sources to vulnerable points",
  "flows": "None; the code only declares exception classes without logic or data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class declarations with no unusual features",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for error handling. The classes inherit from built-in Exception or CryptoError. There are no input reads, data processing, or operations that could be exploited. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and appears purely structural.",
  "conclusion": "This module simply defines custom exception types for cryptography-related errors without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any operations or contain any security risks.",
