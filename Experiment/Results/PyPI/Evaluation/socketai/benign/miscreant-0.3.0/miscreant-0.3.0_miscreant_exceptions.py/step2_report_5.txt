  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is just a set of class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no input/output operations, data flows, or external interactions. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is purely structural, defining exception classes for cryptographic error handling.  \n   - One minor point is that report 5 notes the redefinition of `OverflowError`, which shadows Python's built-in exception. While this is not malicious, it could cause confusion or bugs if not handled carefully. This is a point worth highlighting but does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.  \n   - The risk scores are 0, reflecting no security risk, which is appropriate given the context.  \n   - The malware score remains at 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk or Malware Scores:**  \n   - Since all analyses agree that the code is purely definitional with no malicious intent, there is no justification for increasing the malware or risk scores.  \n   - The only potential concern is the redefinition of `OverflowError` in report 5, which could lead to confusion or bugs but not malicious activity.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities or exploits based on assumptions. All reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature—simple class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct; straightforward class definitions)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct; no security risks or vulnerabilities)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The only slight concern is the shadowing of the built-in `OverflowError`. While not malicious, it could cause confusion or bugs if the custom `OverflowError` is used in place of the built-in one elsewhere in the codebase.  \n- To improve clarity and avoid potential issues, it might be better to rename the custom class to something like `StreamOverflowError` or `CustomOverflowError`.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and serves as a structural component for error handling in a cryptographic library. The scores assigned are appropriate. No changes are necessary unless you want to flag the shadowing of `OverflowError` as a minor concern.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's simple, non-malicious nature.",
