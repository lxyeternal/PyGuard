  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code content confirmation**:  \nThe code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception classes. There are no data flows, input/output, network interactions, or cryptographic operations. The classes are straightforward and serve as error indicators within the Miscreant library.\n\n2. **Presence of issues or malicious activity**:  \nAll reports agree that the code is benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The only noteworthy point is that the class `OverflowError` shadows Python's built-in `OverflowError`, which could cause confusion but is not malicious.\n\n3. **Scores evaluation**:  \n- **Malware score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code or behavior. This seems appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct given the straightforward class definitions.  \n- **Risk score**: All reports assign 0, which is reasonable since the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities or risks.\n\n4. **Any logical flaws or assumptions**:  \nNo report suggests any flaw or assumption that warrants concern. The redefinition of `OverflowError` is slightly unusual but not malicious; it may be a design choice or oversight, but it does not pose a security risk.\n\n5. **Overall assessment**:  \nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, the scores across the board seem accurate and reasonable. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score**: Keep at 0.  \n- **Obfuscated score**: Keep at 0.  \n- **Risk score**: Keep at 0, as the code is purely definitional and harmless.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.",
