  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code verification:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no input/output operations, data flows, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and standard for defining exception classes.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the code is benign.  \n- They correctly note that the code only establishes exception classes and does not perform any malicious activity.  \n- One minor point is that Report 5 mentions that redefining `OverflowError` shadows a built-in exception, which could cause confusion but is not malicious. This is a valid observation.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n- All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, which aligns with the straightforward class definitions.  \n- The `risk` scores are 0 or very low, reflecting the absence of any security concerns.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n- None of the reports justify a higher risk score because they find no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- The code is purely structural, serving as exception definitions.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct.  \n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or hidden payloads.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's structure and purpose.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The malware score should remain at 0.  \n- The obfuscated score should remain at 0.  \n- The overall risk score should be 0, reflecting no security concern.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is standard exception class definitions with no security issues. No further action is necessary.",
