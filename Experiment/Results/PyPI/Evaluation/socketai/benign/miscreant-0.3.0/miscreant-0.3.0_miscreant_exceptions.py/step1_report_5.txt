  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for cryptography-related errors and stream handling in a security context.",
  "sources": "None (no data input reading, environment variables, or user input).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data handling or output).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from sources to sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Simple class definitions for exceptions, no unusual patterns or hidden behavior. The class OverflowError shadows a built-in exception, which could be slightly confusing but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes for cryptographic errors and stream states. All classes inherit from Exception or CryptoError, providing structured error handling. No input/output operations, data processing, or external calls are present. The redefinition of OverflowError could cause confusion with the built-in exception but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines exception classes related to cryptography and stream handling, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The redefinition of OverflowError may be slightly unusual but not malicious. Overall, the code is benign.",
