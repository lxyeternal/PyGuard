{
  "purpose": "Calculate the number of trailing zeros in a byte using a lookup table",
  "sources": "The function 'trailing_zeroes' reads an 8-bit integer 'value' as input",
  "sinks": "The lookup table 'CTZ_TABLE' is accessed with the input value as index to retrieve data",
  "flows": "Input 'value' flows into 'trailing_zeroes' and directly accesses 'CTZ_TABLE' at index 'value'",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The lookup table is standard for such calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lookup table for the number of trailing zeros in a byte, which is used by the 'trailing_zeroes' function to return a value based on the input. The table is static and appears to be a standard, precomputed mapping. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data flows. The function performs a straightforward data lookup without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a byte trailing zero count using a lookup table. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
