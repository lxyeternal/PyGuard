{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility to count the number of trailing zeros in an 8-bit byte using a precomputed lookup table for efficiency.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'value' which is used directly as an index into the static lookup table 'CTZ_TABLE'.",
  "sinks": "The function returns the value from the lookup table; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' (byte) flows directly to index into 'CTZ_TABLE', and the result is returned immediately.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and deterministic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static lookup table with 256 entries, each representing the number of trailing zeros for byte values 0-255. The function 'trailing_zeroes' directly indexes into this table using the input 'value'. The implementation is simple, transparent, and performs no side effects or external data operations. The input is assumed to be within 0-255; if not validated, there could be an out-of-bounds risk, but within the scope of this code, it is a standard pattern. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is a benign utility function for bitwise operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe, and benign implementation of a byte trailing zero counter using a static lookup table. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
