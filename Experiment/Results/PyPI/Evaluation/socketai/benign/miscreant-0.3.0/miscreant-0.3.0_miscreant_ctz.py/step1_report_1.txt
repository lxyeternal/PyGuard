{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to count the number of trailing zeros in a byte value using a lookup table.",
  "sources": "The code reads input through the 'value' parameter of the 'trailing_zeroes' function, which is expected to be an integer between 0 and 255.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a value from the lookup table; no untrusted data is written or transmitted outside the function.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is used directly as an index into the 'CTZ_TABLE' to retrieve the number of trailing zeros.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the lookup table is static and predefined. The function straightforwardly maps input to output without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard technique for counting trailing zeros in a byte via a lookup table. The table contains predefined values for all 256 possible byte inputs. The function takes an integer input, directly indexes into the table, and returns the result. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or obfuscation. The code is simple, transparent, and performs a benign calculation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility function for counting trailing zeros in a byte. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
