{
  "purpose": "Calculate the number of trailing zeroes in a byte using a lookup table.",
  "sources": "The lookup table CTZ_TABLE and the input parameter 'value' in the function trailing_zeroes.",
  "sinks": "The function returns data derived from the input, with no external output or untrusted data flow.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is used as an index to retrieve data from CTZ_TABLE; the output is directly derived from this lookup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The lookup table appears normal and purpose-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static lookup table for counting trailing zeros in a byte, which is a common optimization technique. The function simply retrieves the count from the table based on the input value, with no data modification, external input/output, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The logic is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for counting trailing zeros in a byte. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
