{
  "purpose": "To count the number of trailing zeroes in a byte value using a lookup table.",
  "sources": "The 'value' parameter in the 'trailing_zeroes' function, used as an index into CTZ_TABLE.",
  "sinks": "The function returns data; no untrusted sink interactions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is used directly to access CTZ_TABLE, and the result is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lookup table for trailing zero counts per byte value, and a function that retrieves this value based on input. The table appears to be a static mapping, and the function is straightforward. No dynamic code execution, no external data sources, and no suspicious operations are present. The code strictly performs a simple, deterministic lookup operation without side effects or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, implementing a basic utility function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
