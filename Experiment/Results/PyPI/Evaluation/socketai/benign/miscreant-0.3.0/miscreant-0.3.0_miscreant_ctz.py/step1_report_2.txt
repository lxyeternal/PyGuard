{
  "purpose": "Provide a function to count the number of trailing zeros in an 8-bit integer using a lookup table.",
  "sources": "The lookup table 'CTZ_TABLE' initialized with predefined values; the function 'trailing_zeroes' takes an input 'value'.",
  "sinks": "The 'trailing_zeroes' function returns data directly from the lookup table without processing untrusted input beyond indexing.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is used as an index to retrieve the count of trailing zeros from 'CTZ_TABLE'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The lookup table is static and appears to serve a specific purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static lookup table for counting trailing zeros in bytes, indexed directly by the input value. The 'trailing_zeroes' function simply returns the corresponding value from the table. There are no obfuscated elements, no dynamic code execution, no external data sources, and no suspicious logic. The data flow is simple: input value used as an index, output retrieved directly. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent. The code appears to be a utility function for bitwise operations, typical for low-level data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic utility for counting trailing zeros in an 8-bit integer, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is well-structured and performs a simple lookup operation. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
