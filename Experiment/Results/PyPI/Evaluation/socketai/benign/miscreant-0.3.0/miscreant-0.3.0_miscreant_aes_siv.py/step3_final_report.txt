{
  "purpose": "The code implements AES-SIV misuse resistant authenticated encryption following RFC 5297, providing secure encryption and integrity verification for messages with associated data.",
  "sources": "Key generation via os.urandom; input plaintext and associated data; internal cryptographic primitives (CMAC, AES, CTR mode).",
  "sinks": "Output ciphertext (including IV); verification via constant-time comparison; no external data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Key generation → key splitting → seal/open methods → __s2v and __transform functions process data → produce or verify ciphertext and plaintext.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external network activity detected. External modules ('block', 'exceptions') assumed benign.",
  "analysis": "The code follows cryptographic standards, uses secure randomness, validates inputs, and performs proper integrity checks. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are evident. The cryptographic primitives are used correctly, and the implementation appears complete and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, correct implementation of AES-SIV encryption with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, and the malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
