  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets.",
    "No suspicious network activity or external data transmission.",
    "Standard cryptographic constructs with no obfuscation or unusual code patterns.",

  "analysis": "The code implements a well-structured AES-SIV scheme, utilizing cryptographically secure randomness, proper MAC and encryption primitives, and constant-time comparisons for integrity. The methods follow RFC 5297 specifications, with appropriate key handling and input validation. No hidden or malicious behaviors are apparent, and no suspicious network or backdoor activities are evident. The code appears to be a standard cryptographic implementation focused on data confidentiality and integrity, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of AES-SIV encryption with no malicious behavior detected. It securely manages keys, uses standard cryptographic practices, and does not contain suspicious anomalies. No malicious intent or security compromise is evident.",
