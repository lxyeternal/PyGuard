  "anomalies": [
    "Use of os.urandom for key generation is standard and not suspicious.",
    "No hardcoded secrets or credentials present.",
    "No unusual or obfuscated code structures; code appears straightforward.",
    "Cryptographic operations follow RFC 5297 specifications.",
    "No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or backdoors detected."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code implements AES-SIV encryption, including key generation, encryption, and decryption functions. It uses cryptographically secure random functions for key creation, standard AES-CTR mode for encryption, and CMAC for authentication. The code strictly adheres to known cryptographic standards (RFC 5297), with proper handling of associated data and plaintext. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. All cryptographic primitives are used correctly and transparently, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. The code maintains data integrity and confidentiality as intended without any suspicious side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "The source code appears to be a well-implemented, standard AES-SIV encryption scheme without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities based on the provided code segment.",
