  "purpose": "Implement AES-SIV misuse resistant authenticated encryption cipher for secure message encryption and verification.",
  "sources": "os.urandom() for key generation, input parameters in methods (plaintext, associated_data, ciphertext, key).",
  "sinks": "os.urandom() output, cryptography primitives (CMAC, AES, CTR mode), exceptions.",
  "flows": "generate_key() -> return os.urandom; __init__() -> validate key; seal() -> __s2v() -> __transform(); open() -> __transform() -> __s2v() -> verify equality.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; standard cryptography library usage; no obfuscated or unusual code patterns; proper use of constant_time comparisons.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements AES-SIV encryption with proper key management, authentication, and integrity verification. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No obfuscation or suspicious code structures detected. The use of cryptography primitives appears standard and correct. There are no embedded malicious code snippets, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data leaks or system manipulations. The code’s functions focus solely on encryption/decryption, consistent with its documented purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-implemented cryptographic module for AES-SIV encryption. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are detected. It correctly handles key generation, message authentication, and decryption with integrity checks. No signs of malware or security risks are present.",
