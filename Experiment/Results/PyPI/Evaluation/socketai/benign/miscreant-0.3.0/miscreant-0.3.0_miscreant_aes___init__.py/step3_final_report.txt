  "purpose": "Descriptive comment or documentation about the AES algorithm.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only a docstring or comment describing AES.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only static description.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code; only a string or comment.",
  "analysis": "The snippet contains only a descriptive string or comment about AES, with no implementation, data flow, or code execution. No secrets, no network activity, and no suspicious constructs are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, aligning with the benign nature of the content. The confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty that this is just documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is purely descriptive documentation with no malicious intent or security risks. All scores are appropriate and indicate a very low threat level.",
