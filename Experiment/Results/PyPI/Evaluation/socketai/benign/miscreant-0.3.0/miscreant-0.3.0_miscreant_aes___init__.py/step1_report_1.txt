  "purpose": "Implementing or describing the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) block cipher.",
  "sources": "Potentially includes imports, function definitions, or data input handling related to AES encryption.",
  "sinks": "Encryption functions, data output, or key handling points.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into encryption functions, possibly involving key material, and results in encrypted output.",
  "anomalies": "The provided snippet is only a docstring with no executable code, no secrets, no unusual language features, or suspicious behaviors visible.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is solely a descriptive string about AES without any executable code. Without actual implementation, data processing, or key management code present, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The lack of code also limits the ability to identify sources, sinks, or flows beyond the descriptive comment.",
  "conclusion": "This input contains only a descriptive comment with no executable or functional code. Therefore, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and non-malicious based solely on this snippet.",
