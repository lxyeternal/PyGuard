  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is present in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a descriptive string with no executable or operational code; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is solely a comment string describing the AES block cipher. There are no functions, data processing, input handling, or any executable components. As it lacks any operational code, it cannot perform any malicious actions, data leakage, or security breaches. The snippet appears to serve as documentation or a descriptive comment.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is purely a descriptive comment with no executable logic. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, contain security risks, or obfuscated code. It is a benign documentation statement.",
