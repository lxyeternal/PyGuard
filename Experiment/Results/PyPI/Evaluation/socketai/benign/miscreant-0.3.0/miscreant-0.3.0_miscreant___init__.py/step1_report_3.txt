  "purpose": "A misuse-resistant symmetric encryption library",
  "sources": "Potential user inputs, data passed to encryption functions",
  "sinks": "Encryption and decryption functions, possibly file or network output",
  "flows": "Input data -> Encryption functions -> Output ciphertext; or ciphertext -> Decryption functions -> plaintext",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures",
  "analysis": "The provided code appears to be a straightforward description of a symmetric encryption library named 'Miscreant.' It emphasizes misuse resistance but does not contain any code snippets or implementation details. Without actual implementation, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. No obfuscation, hidden functions, or suspicious data handling are evident. The focus seems to be on secure encryption practices, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided description, the code appears to be a benign, purpose-driven library aimed at secure symmetric encryption. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in the snippet provided.",
