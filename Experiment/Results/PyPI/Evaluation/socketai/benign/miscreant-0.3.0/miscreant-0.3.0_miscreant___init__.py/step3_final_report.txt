  "purpose": "A misuse-resistant symmetric encryption library",
  "sources": "No implementation code provided; only a descriptive docstring",
  "sinks": "No data flows or untrusted data handling observed due to lack of code",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no code to analyze for data flow",
  "anomalies": "Absence of implementation details; only a docstring present, no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "All reports are based solely on a description with no actual code. No vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or anomalies can be identified. Malware scores are appropriately zero; obfuscation is not observed. Security risk scores are very low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting the lack of implementation details. Confidence levels vary but are generally high given the limited information, though they could be slightly reduced due to absence of code. The reasoning across reports is consistent and cautious, avoiding unwarranted assumptions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided description alone, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the limited information. To perform a thorough security assessment, actual implementation code would be necessary.",
