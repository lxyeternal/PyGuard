  "flows": "Input data -> encryption/decryption functions -> output data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected from the provided snippet; the description suggests a focus on cryptographic functions",
  "analysis": "The code appears to define a symmetric encryption library designed to resist misuse. No suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials, hidden network activity, or obfuscated code are evident in the provided snippet. The focus is on cryptography, with standard constructs implied. As the code is only a docstring and no actual implementation details are provided, there are no obvious security risks or malicious behaviors. Without further code, no malicious intent can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code's purpose is to implement a misuse-resistant encryption library, with no apparent vulnerabilities or malicious features visible.",
