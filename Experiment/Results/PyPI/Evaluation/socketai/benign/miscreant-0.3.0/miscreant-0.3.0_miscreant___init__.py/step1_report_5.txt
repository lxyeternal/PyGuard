{
  "purpose": "A misuse-resistant symmetric encryption library",
  "sources": "Likely reading cryptographic keys, data to encrypt/decrypt, environment variables for configuration",
  "sinks": "Encryption/decryption functions, potentially network transmission or file output",
  "flows": "Input data or keys flow into encryption/decryption functions, possibly to output or network transmission",
  "anomalies": "No code provided, so no anomalies detected; the description alone is benign",
  "analysis": "The provided description indicates a symmetric encryption library aimed at misuse resistance. Without actual code, it's impossible to identify specific sources, sinks, or flows. If code were provided, one would analyze for hardcoded secrets, insecure key handling, or suspicious data transmission. As only a descriptive string is present, no malicious behavior or anomalies are observable.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided description, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The library appears intended for cryptographic purposes with an emphasis on misuse resistance. No suspicious code or security risks are evident.",
