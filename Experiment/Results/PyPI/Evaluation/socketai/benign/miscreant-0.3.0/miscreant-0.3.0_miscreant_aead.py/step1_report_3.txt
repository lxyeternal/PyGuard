{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) using AES-SIV and PMAC algorithms.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.urandom) for nonce generation; receives key, plaintext, nonce, and associated_data as parameters.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptographic primitives for encryption/decryption; no data output sinks are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Input data (plaintext, associated data, nonce, key) flows into encryption/decryption functions, which process via the SIV instance.",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.urandom for nonce generation, which is standard; no hardcoded secrets or credentials detected; no obfuscated code or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a straightforward, high-level interface for AEAD encryption. It employs secure cryptographic primitives (CMAC, PMAC) from the cryptography library and proper nonce generation. The functions enforce data types for nonce and associated data, reducing misuse. No suspicious code or malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is evident. The code appears to be a typical cryptographic utility module with correct usage of cryptographic primitives and secure random number generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an AEAD encryption wrapper using cryptographic primitives and secure random number generation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code segment.",
