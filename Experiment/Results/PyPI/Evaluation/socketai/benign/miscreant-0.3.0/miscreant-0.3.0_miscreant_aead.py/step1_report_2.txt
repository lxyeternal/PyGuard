{
  "purpose": "The code provides a high-level API for authenticated encryption using AES-SIV or AES-PMAC-SIV algorithms, including key and nonce generation, encryption (seal), and decryption (open).",
  "sources": "Input data includes plaintext, nonce, associated_data, and key provided during initialization.",
  "sinks": "The main data flow involves passing plaintext, nonce, and associated_data to the 'seal' method for encryption and ciphertext, nonce, and associated_data to the 'open' method for decryption.",
  "flows": "Input data (plaintext, nonce, associated_data) flows into 'seal' which outputs ciphertext; ciphertext, nonce, and associated_data flow into 'open' which outputs plaintext after verification.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard cryptographic libraries and functions with no suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic. The nonce must be bytes, and no insecure patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a cryptographic interface for authenticated encryption. It generates cryptographically secure random nonces and keys using os.urandom and provided generate_key methods. The class supports two algorithms with proper parameter validation. It does not contain obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns. The code's logic is straightforward, utilizing standard cryptography primitives, and does not perform any network communication, system modifications, or data exfiltration. It appears to be a clean, well-structured implementation of an AEAD scheme, with no indicators of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an AEAD encryption interface using cryptography primitives, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears safe and intended solely for encryption purposes.",
