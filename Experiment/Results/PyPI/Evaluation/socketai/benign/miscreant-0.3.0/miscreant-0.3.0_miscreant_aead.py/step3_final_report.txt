{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) using AES-SIV or AES-PMAC-SIV algorithms, facilitating secure encryption and decryption with associated data.",
  "sources": "Key generation via static methods, nonce generation via os.urandom, input parameters for plaintext, associated data, and nonce in 'seal' and 'open' methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain external data sinks; it primarily processes data internally for cryptographic operations.",
  "flows": "Key and algorithm selection flow during initialization, data flow from plaintext, associated data, and nonce into 'seal'/'open' methods, passing through cryptographic primitives for encryption/decryption.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. Input validation is appropriate, and randomness is generated securely.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, high-level wrapper around cryptographic primitives (CMAC, PMAC, SIV). It performs standard input validation, uses secure randomness, and delegates cryptographic operations to well-established modules. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The selection of algorithms is based on string matching, and the code does not perform network activity or system modifications. The cryptographic primitives are assumed to be correctly implemented and secure. Overall, the implementation aligns with best practices for cryptographic code, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure, and well-structured cryptographic utility for AEAD encryption. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
