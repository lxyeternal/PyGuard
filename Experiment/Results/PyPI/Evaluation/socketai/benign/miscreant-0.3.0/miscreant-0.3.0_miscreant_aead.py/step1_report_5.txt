{
  "purpose": "The source code provides a high-level interface for authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) using AES-SIV and AES-PMAC-SIV algorithms.",
  "sources": "os.urandom for nonce generation, input parameters for 'seal' and 'open' methods (plaintext, ciphertext, nonce, associated_data), and the key provided during initialization.",
  "sinks": "os.urandom output, the encryption and decryption functions of the 'self.siv' object, and the raised exceptions.",
  "flows": "os.urandom generates nonces used in encryption; 'seal' encrypts and authenticates data with associated data; 'open' verifies and decrypts ciphertext with associated data. Inputs flow into 'seal'/'open' methods, then through 'self.siv' methods which handle cryptographic processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network activity or data leaks; the code properly uses cryptographic primitives and randomness. No unusual language features or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an AEAD class for authenticated encryption with associated data, selecting between AES-SIV and AES-PMAC-SIV algorithms based on user input. It uses os.urandom for nonce generation, which is appropriate for cryptographic purposes. The encryption ('seal') and decryption ('open') methods perform input type checks and invoke cryptographic primitives. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The implementation appears standard and secure, assuming the underlying 'SIV', 'CMAC', and 'PMAC' implementations are secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of AEAD encryption, utilizing well-known cryptographic primitives without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It adheres to best practices for nonce generation and input validation. No security risks or malware indicators are evident.",
