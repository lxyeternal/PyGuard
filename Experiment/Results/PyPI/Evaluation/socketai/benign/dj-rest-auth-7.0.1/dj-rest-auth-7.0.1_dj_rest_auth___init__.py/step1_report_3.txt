{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or application logic, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input is read from the 'input_data' variable or potentially from external sources if connected elsewhere; no explicit external data sources are evident within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed and possibly printed or stored; no insecure or dangerous sinks such as network connections, file modifications, or system commands are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables through processing functions and potentially to output statements; no untrusted data flow to dangerous sinks is observable.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are detected. The code structure appears straightforward without obfuscation or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and lacks external input handling, network calls, or sensitive data management. It does not perform unsafe operations like executing dynamic code, accessing environment variables insecurely, or using insecure SQL queries. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. Given the limited context and straightforward nature, the code does not exhibit anomalies or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign and safe for use.",
