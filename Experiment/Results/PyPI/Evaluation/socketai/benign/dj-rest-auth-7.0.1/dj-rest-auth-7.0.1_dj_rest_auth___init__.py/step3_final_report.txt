{
  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code analysis, source and sink identification, flow analysis, anomalies, and overall security posture.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, command line arguments, external modules/files, network interactions, subprocess calls, file operations",
  "sinks": "Network connections, subprocess executions, file writes, data leaks, environment variable access",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, args) to sinks (network, subprocess, files), potential data exfiltration or malicious command execution pathways",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious signatures; code simplicity and benign behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with no external network calls or suspicious patterns. Input sources are typical, and sinks are standard system interactions. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscation are present. The code's benign nature is supported by the lack of malicious signatures or suspicious behaviors. The security risk is low, and confidence in benign assessment is high. No malicious intent or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The security risk is minimal, and the code structure is straightforward and safe. Scores are consistent with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary.",
