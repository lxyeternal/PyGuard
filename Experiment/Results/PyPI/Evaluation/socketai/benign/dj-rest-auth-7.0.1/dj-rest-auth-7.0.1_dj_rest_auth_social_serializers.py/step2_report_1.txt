  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles social login via Twitter and Microsoft, with proper validation, token handling, and use of allauth functions.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious functions. The code performs standard OAuth flows.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The code is standard and secure, with no signs of malicious activity. The low risk score aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on session storage of OAuth tokens and standard OAuth flow.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious code. Session storage of tokens is typical but should be managed securely.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The use of session storage for tokens is common in OAuth flows; no malicious activity is suggested. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Handles social login, with tokens stored in session and passed to social login functions.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious code. Standard OAuth practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is accurate. The code performs expected OAuth login flows without malicious intent. The risk score remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with focus on token handling and social login completion.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. Uses standard allauth functions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is solid. No malicious behavior detected, and the code follows standard practices.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing proper token handling and social login flow.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. Standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The very low risk score is justified given the standard and secure nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Critical Review:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None detected. All reports correctly identify that the code is standard, secure, and free of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate. The obfuscated scores are 0, also appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** All are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the standard nature of the code and absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9), justified by the consistent analysis.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code appears to be legitimate, well-structured, and follows best practices for social login handling.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks beyond typical OAuth flows.\n- The session storage of tokens, while standard, should be managed securely in deployment but does not constitute a risk in itself.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly related to session management, which is standard)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. The low risk scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.",
