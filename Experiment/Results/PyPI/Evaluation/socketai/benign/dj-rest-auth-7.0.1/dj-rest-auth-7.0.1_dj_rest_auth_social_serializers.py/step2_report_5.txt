  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code handles social login via Twitter and Microsoft, with token validation, session storage, and user assignment. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The code matches the description; no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The session storage of tokens is standard, though it warrants secure session management.\n- The security risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable given the token handling, but not high.\n\n**Verdict**: The scores seem appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to report 1, emphasizing standard OAuth login flows, session storage, and error handling.\n- **Scores**: same as above, malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The flow is standard; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Use of session to store tokens is typical but should be secured properly.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, standard social login flow, with tokens stored in session and passed to 'complete_social_login'.\n- **Scores**: same as above, malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment**:\n- No signs of malicious code.\n- The use of session for tokens is common, though security depends on deployment.\n\n**Verdict**: Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar flow, with no suspicious behaviors or obfuscation.\n- **Scores**: same as above, malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The code appears standard, with proper error handling.\n- No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Same as others, standard social login flow, no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment**:\n- Slightly lower security risk score (0.1) compared to others, which seems reasonable given the similar code.\n\n**Verdict**: Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code performs standard social login handling.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are slightly conservative, reflecting the potential risk of token handling but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score**: Should remain at 0 across all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk**: Slightly varies between 0.1 and 0.2, which is reasonable given the token handling and session storage practices.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Security risk**: 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate; the code is standard, well-structured, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The risk scores are justified and should remain as is.",
