{
  "purpose": "This code provides serializers for handling social login via Twitter and Microsoft accounts in a Django REST Framework application, managing OAuth tokens and completing social login flows.",
  "sources": "Reads 'request' object from serializer context, input data 'access_token', 'token_secret', or 'accessToken' from request payload.",
  "sinks": "Uses social login functions ('complete_social_login', 'login.lookup', 'login.save') which could potentially process untrusted data; session storage of OAuth tokens; assignment to 'attrs['user']'.",
  "flows": "Input tokens from client → stored in session or token objects → used in social login flow → user data assigned to 'attrs' for further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code properly handles potential OAuth errors.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves tokens from client input, stores OAuth tokens in session or token objects, then completes social login via 'complete_social_login'. It checks for the presence of adapter class and view in context, which is standard. No insecure data handling or suspicious network activity is evident. The functions use standard libraries and patterns for social login. There is no evidence of malicious payload or behavior, and the code appears to follow best practices for such flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of social login serializers, with proper handling of tokens and errors. No malicious or suspicious behaviors detected, and no security risks evident from this review.",
