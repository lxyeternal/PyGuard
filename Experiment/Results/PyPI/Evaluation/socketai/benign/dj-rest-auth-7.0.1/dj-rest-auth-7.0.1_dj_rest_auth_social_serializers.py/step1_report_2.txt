  "purpose": "Serializer classes for handling social login via Twitter and Microsoft OAuth providers, validating tokens, and completing social login processes within a Django REST Framework context.",
  "sources": "Reading access tokens from request data ('access_token', 'token_secret', 'accessToken'), reading the request object from context, and calling provider-specific methods to complete login.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'complete_social_login', 'login.lookup()', 'login.save()', and setting 'request.session' data. These could lead to session modification or data exposure if misused.",
  "flows": "Input tokens -> get_social_login() via adapter -> complete_login() -> complete_social_login() -> login.lookup() -> login.save() -> setting request.session data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Usage of 'request.session' to store OAuth tokens could be risky if session management is compromised, but is standard practice. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard OAuth social login procedures: extracting tokens, completing login with adapter methods, and saving user info. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Proper exception handling for OAuth errors is present. No use of unsafe code practices or hardcoded secrets is observed. The session data storage of tokens is typical but should be secured properly in deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement typical social login workflows without malicious intent. There are no indicators of malware or security risks beyond normal OAuth handling. Usage of request session to store tokens is standard but warrants secure session management. Overall, the code seems safe, with low likelihood of malicious behavior.",
