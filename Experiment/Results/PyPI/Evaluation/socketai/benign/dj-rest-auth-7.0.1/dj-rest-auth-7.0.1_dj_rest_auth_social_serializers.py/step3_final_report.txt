{
  "purpose": "Handles social login via OAuth providers (Twitter and Microsoft) using Django REST Framework serializers, validating tokens, and completing social login flows.",
  "sources": "User input fields 'access_token', 'token_secret', 'accessToken'; request object via context; OAuth response data.",
  "sinks": "allauth.socialaccount functions (complete_login, complete_social_login), session storage of tokens, assignment to login.account.user.",
  "flows": "Input fields -> validate() method -> token creation -> get_social_login() -> complete_login() -> complete_social_login() -> assign user.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. Standard OAuth flow with token handling and error management.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard social login procedures with proper validation, token handling, and error catching. Tokens are stored temporarily in session, which is typical but should be managed securely in deployment. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The use of allauth functions aligns with best practices. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2, confidence=0.9) are consistent with the code's behavior and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of social login serializers, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified given the standard OAuth flow and token management. No adjustments are necessary; the code is safe for use.",
