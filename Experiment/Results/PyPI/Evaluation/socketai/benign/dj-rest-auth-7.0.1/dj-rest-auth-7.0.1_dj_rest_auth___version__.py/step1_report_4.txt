  "sources": "Constant string assignments to module-level variables",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns static strings",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no external network calls",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward metadata declarations for the package. It assigns static strings to variables that describe the package. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external data access, and no suspicious patterns detected. The code is typical for package metadata files and contains no malicious intent or malicious code structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to declare package metadata. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present.",
