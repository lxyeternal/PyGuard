  "purpose": "Define metadata variables for the dj-rest-auth package, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting string values to metadata variables at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code only assigns static string literals.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; only static assignments are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code contains only metadata variable definitions with static string values.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of package metadata variables with static strings. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external data handling, and no potential attack vectors such as code injection, credential handling, or network communication. The code appears to be part of a package setup or module metadata, which is standard practice and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical metadata declaration for a Python package and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply assigns static strings to variables describing the package.",
