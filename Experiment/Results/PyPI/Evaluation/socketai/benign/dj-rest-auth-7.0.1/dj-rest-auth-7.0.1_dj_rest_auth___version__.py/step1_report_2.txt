  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'dj-rest-auth' Python package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string and URL literals to module-level variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns static strings to variables describing package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, email, license, and copyright. There are no input sources, data processing, or external data interactions. The code appears to be a straightforward module metadata declaration typical in Python packages. No obfuscated code, malicious functions, or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package metadata with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign and intended solely for informational purposes within the package.",
