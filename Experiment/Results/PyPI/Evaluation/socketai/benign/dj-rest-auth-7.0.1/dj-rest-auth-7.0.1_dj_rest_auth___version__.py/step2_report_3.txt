  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Content Summary:**\nThe code consists solely of variable assignments setting static string values for package metadata:\n```python\n__title__ = 'dj-rest-auth'\n__description__ = 'Authentication and Registration in Django Rest Framework.'\n__url__ = 'http://github.com/iMerica/dj-rest-auth'\n__version__ = '7.0.1'\n__author__ = '@iMerica https://github.com/iMerica'\n__author_email__ = 'imichael@pm.me'\n__license__ = 'MIT'\n__copyright__ = 'Copyright 2020 @iMerica https://github.com/iMerica'\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  **No.** The code is purely static metadata; no malicious code, data flows, or external inputs are involved.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  **No.** The reports correctly identify this as standard package metadata with no suspicious behavior.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware score (all reports):** 0  \n  **Appropriate.** No malware is indicated or suspected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n  **Appropriate.** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security risk score:** 0  \n  **Appropriate.** No security issues are evident.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since the code only contains static variable assignments with package info, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n- The reports' scores are consistent and justified.\n\n### Potential Claims or Assumptions:\n- The reports do not assume malicious intent; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No suspicious patterns or behaviors are inferred.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a standard, straightforward package metadata declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive content. It is typical in Python package setups and does not pose any supply chain risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
