  "purpose": "This code serves as package metadata for the 'dj-rest-auth' Python package, providing static information such as title, description, URL, version, author details, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments defining package metadata (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__)",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, network calls, or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static data assignments without data flow or external data sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward static metadata with no dynamic or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments for package metadata, typical for Python package setup files. No functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with high confidence, and assign malware and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these scores. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident. The code is standard and safe for supply chain purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign package metadata with no malicious or security risks. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
