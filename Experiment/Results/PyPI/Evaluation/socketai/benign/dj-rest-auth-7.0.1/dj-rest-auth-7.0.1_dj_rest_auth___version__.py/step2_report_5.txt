  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code?**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is just static variable assignments for package metadata. There are no inputs, no network calls, no dynamic code, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. Therefore, **no malicious code is present**.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports?**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is straightforward metadata assignment, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. No logical flaws or errors are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n   - **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malware detected.  \n   - **Security risk score (0):** Correct, no security issues or vulnerabilities identified.  \n   \n   Since the code is benign, these scores are appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**  \n   No justification is needed for higher scores; the evidence supports a zero score across malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports correctly avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on static analysis, noting the absence of suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear, static assignments)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard package metadata declaration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe and poses no supply chain security risk.",
