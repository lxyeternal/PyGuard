  "purpose": "Manage JWT tokens via cookies with CSRF protection, including setting, unsetting, and refreshing tokens.",
  "sources": "Request cookies for refresh tokens; request data for 'refresh' parameter; request headers for JWT tokens.",
  "sinks": "Response cookies for access and refresh tokens; response data for token info; CSRF validation triggers exceptions.",
  "flows": "Extract refresh token from request data or cookies -> validate token -> set cookies in response -> enforce CSRF if needed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Code follows standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard JWT cookie management with CSRF enforcement. It reads tokens from request data and cookies, validates tokens, and sets/deletes cookies accordingly. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The CSRF enforcement aligns with best practices. The code is clear, well-structured, and adheres to security standards.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for JWT cookie handling with CSRF protection. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain risks are evident. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the context. Overall, the code is secure and suitable for production use.",
