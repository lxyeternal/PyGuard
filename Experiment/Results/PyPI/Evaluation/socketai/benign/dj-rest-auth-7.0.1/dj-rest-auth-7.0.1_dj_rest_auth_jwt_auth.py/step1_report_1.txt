  "purpose": "This code manages JWT tokens through cookies, including setting, unsetting, and refreshing tokens, as well as handling authentication via cookies with CSRF enforcement.",
  "sources": "Request cookies (request.COOKIES), request data (request.data), request headers (get_header method).",
  "sinks": "Response cookies (set_cookie, delete_cookie), response data (response.data), raising exceptions for CSRF failure.",
  "flows": "Input from request cookies or data flows into token validation and extraction; validated tokens are used to set or delete cookies; response data is modified to include tokens and expiration times.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to follow standard practices for JWT cookie handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. CSRF enforcement is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages JWT tokens via cookies, with configurable options for security flags. It properly enforces CSRF validation when configured, and tokens are extracted from cookies or request data. The token setting and unsetting functions correctly handle cookie attributes. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are evident. The code appears to be a standard implementation for JWT cookie management and CSRF enforcement in Django REST Framework. No anomalies or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation for managing JWT tokens via cookies with CSRF protection. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It follows recommended practices for token handling and CSRF enforcement.",
