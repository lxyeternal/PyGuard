{
  "purpose": "This code manages JWT tokens through cookies, including setting, unsetting, and refreshing tokens, as well as implementing a custom authentication class for cookie-based JWT authentication with CSRF protection.",
  "sources": "Request data (request.data, request.COOKIES), environment variables (via api_settings), HTTP headers (via get_header).",
  "sinks": "Setting cookies (response.set_cookie), deleting cookies (response.delete_cookie), raising exceptions, modifying response data.",
  "flows": "Token extraction from cookies or request data -> validation -> setting cookies or response modification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls observed. The CSRF enforcement aligns with standard practices; no unusual or malicious code behaviors are evident. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to handle JWT tokens securely by setting, refreshing, and deleting cookies with configurable options. The CSRF enforcement is implemented in a standard manner. Token extraction considers both request data and cookies, with an option to enforce CSRF checks. No suspicious external network calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors identified. Usage of Django and rest_framework libraries is typical for such authentication modules. Overall, the code aligns with best practices for cookie-based JWT authentication without apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates standard JWT cookie handling with appropriate security measures, including CSRF enforcement and configurable cookie attributes. No malicious behaviors or sabotage are evident. It appears to be a legitimate component of an authentication system.",
