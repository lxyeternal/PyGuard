{
  "purpose": "This code manages JWT cookies, including setting, unsetting, and refreshing tokens, as well as an authentication class that uses cookies and headers for JWT validation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from request.COOKIES, request.data, and request.META, especially for tokens and CSRF validation.",
  "sinks": "Sets and deletes cookies on the response object; accesses request data and cookies for tokens.",
  "flows": "Source: request data or cookies -> Sink: setting/deleting cookies; validation flow: extract token from request -> validate token -> set cookies or raise exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials; CSRF enforcement is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic code execution. The refresh token extraction logic prioritizes cookie or request data, which is typical. The use of response.set_cookie and delete_cookie appears standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages JWT tokens via cookies, includes CSRF validation when configured, and handles token refresh logic with custom serializer and view. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or backdoors. The token extraction from request data and cookies is standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code injection. The logic for setting, unsetting, and refreshing tokens appears proper, and no obfuscation or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for JWT cookie handling with CSRF protection and token refresh. It does not contain malicious intent or security risks beyond typical application logic. No malware or supply chain attacks are evident.",
