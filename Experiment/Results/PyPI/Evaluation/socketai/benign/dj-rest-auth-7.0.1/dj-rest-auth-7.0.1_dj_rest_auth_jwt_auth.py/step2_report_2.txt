  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, evaluating the reasoning, and ensuring the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected. The code manages JWT cookies and CSRF as per standard practices.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Risk is 0.2, malware 0.0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a typical implementation for JWT cookie management with CSRF enforcement.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with standard handling of JWT cookies, refresh tokens, and CSRF. No anomalies or malicious behavior identified.\n- **Scores:** Risk 0.2, malware 0.0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** The report's reasoning is valid. The implementation appears secure and standard.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, standard JWT cookie handling with CSRF enforcement. No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Risk 0.2, malware 0.0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Standard JWT cookie management, CSRF enforcement, no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Risk 0.2, malware 0.0.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is sound; no issues detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, standard practices, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Risk 0.2, malware 0.0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports describe standard, secure implementations of JWT cookie management with CSRF protection. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain risks are evident. The scores assigned (risk 0.2, malware 0) are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated code:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, typical security considerations for cookie handling and CSRF)\n\nThe reports are consistent, and the reasoning aligns with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes are necessary. The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation for JWT cookie management with proper security considerations.",
