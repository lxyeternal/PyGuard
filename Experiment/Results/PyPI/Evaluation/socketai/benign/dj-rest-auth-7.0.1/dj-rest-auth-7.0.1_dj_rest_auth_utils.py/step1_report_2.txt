{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for token creation and encoding in a Django application, specifically related to JWT tokens and lazy string formatting.",
  "sources": "The only source of external data is the user object passed to jwt_encode and token model passed to default_create_token.",
  "sinks": "The functions return tokens and formatted strings; no direct sinks of untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "flows": "User object is used in jwt_encode to generate a token; token model is used in default_create_token to retrieve or create a token; formatted string is generated via lazy formatter.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns are present. The lazy evaluation of format_lazy is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily interacts with Django models and serializers, using standard methods such as get_or_create and get_token. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. External data flows are limited to expected inputs (user, token model). No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious network activity. The use of Django's lazy function for string formatting is a common pattern and does not introduce security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for JWT token handling and lazy string formatting without any malicious intent or security issues. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior, and the code follows typical patterns.",
