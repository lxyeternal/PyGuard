  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as standard Django utility functions for token management and lazy string formatting.\n- No report indicates any obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity.\n- The 'malware' score is uniformly 0 across all reports, aligning with the assessment that no malicious behavior is evident.\n- The 'securityRisk' scores are low (mostly 0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern, which seems appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Confirmations & Logical Checks:**\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials or backdoors.\n- The functions interact with Django models, serializers, and settings in a typical manner.\n- Lazy string formatting is standard in Django and does not introduce security issues.\n- JWT token generation via `get_token(user)` is a common pattern; no anomalies are observed.\n\n**Potential Flaws or Issues in the Reports:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are reasonable given the code's description.\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as standard.\n\n**Scores & Justifications:**\n- Since the code is standard and no malicious activity is detected, the malware score remains at 0.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the minimal potential for harm.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, due to interaction with user data and token creation, but standard practice)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical implementation of token creation and lazy string formatting in Django, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- I agree with the existing scores, with a slight emphasis on maintaining a malware score of 0.\n- No changes are necessary; the code appears safe and legitimate.",
