  "purpose": "Utility functions for token creation and formatting in a Django application using JWT authentication.",
  "sources": "User object passed into jwt_encode, external API settings imported within jwt_encode.",
  "sinks": "Potential data handling in token generation and string formatting functions.",
  "flows": "User input flows into jwt_encode from external sources, then into token creation and formatting functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious API calls or network operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for creating JWT tokens and formatting strings lazily. The token creation uses the user object and external settings for JWT serialization, which appears standard and safe. The lazy formatting function utilizes Django's lazy utility, which is common. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors. External settings are imported inside the function, which is a typical pattern. Overall, the code appears to serve legitimate purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard Django utility code for token handling and string formatting. No evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation is present.",
