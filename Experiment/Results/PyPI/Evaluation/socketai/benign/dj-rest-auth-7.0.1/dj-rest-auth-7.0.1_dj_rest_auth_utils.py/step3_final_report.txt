{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for token creation, JWT encoding, and lazy string formatting within a Django application.",
  "sources": "Django models (`token_model.objects.get_or_create`), JWT serializer (`JWTTokenClaimsSerializer.get_token`), and string input for formatting.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Input data from user objects and serializers flows into token creation and JWT generation functions, with no external or malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard Django patterns, no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard utility functions for token management and string formatting in Django. It interacts with Django ORM, serializers, and settings in a typical manner. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The dynamic import within `jwt_encode` is standard practice. The lazy string formatting is safe. All reports correctly assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk scores (~0.1), which are justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, straightforward Django utility code for token handling and lazy string formatting. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign behavior.",
