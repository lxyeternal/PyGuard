  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for token creation and encoding in a Django application, specifically for JWT tokens and lazy string formatting.",
  "sources": "Reading user object for token creation, importing settings and serializers from dj_rest_auth, and the lazy evaluation function for string formatting.",
  "sinks": "Token creation using get_or_create, JWT token generation via serializer, and lazy string formatting execution.",
  "flows": "User object -> token_model.objects.get_or_create -> JWTTokenClaimsSerializer.get_token -> refresh.access_token; s and args -> s.format",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; usage of dynamic import for settings and serializers is standard in Django. Lazy string formatting is safe in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard token management and lazy string formatting. It dynamically imports settings and serializers, which is common in Django. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The JWT token generation relies on serializer methods, which are typical. The lazy function defers string formatting until needed. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for token handling and lazy string formatting in a Django context. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
