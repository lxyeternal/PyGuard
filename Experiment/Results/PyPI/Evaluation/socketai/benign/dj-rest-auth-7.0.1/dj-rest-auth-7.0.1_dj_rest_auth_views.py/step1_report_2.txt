{
  "purpose": "This code provides user authentication, session management, password reset, and user detail functionalities within a Django REST Framework API.",
  "sources": "Input data from request.data (POST parameters), request.COOKIES (JWT refresh token), and request.user.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via response data, setting cookies, token blacklisting, or attribute deletions.",
  "flows": "Input from request data or cookies flows through serializers and token handling functions; sensitive data can be set in cookies or responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code; careful JWT cookie management and token blacklisting are present. No unusual code structures or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard user auth features using Django and DRF, including JWT support with optional cookies and token blacklisting. It manages login/logout processes securely, with session handling and JWT token setting/unsetting. Token blacklisting occurs in logout if enabled, with proper exception handling. Password reset and change workflows use serializers and Django forms securely. No indicators of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or secret hardcoding are present. Use of environment variables and external libraries is standard, with optional JWT features handled conditionally.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate user authentication and session management code with no malicious intent. It adheres to best practices for token handling, session management, and password workflows, with no suspicious behaviors detected.",
