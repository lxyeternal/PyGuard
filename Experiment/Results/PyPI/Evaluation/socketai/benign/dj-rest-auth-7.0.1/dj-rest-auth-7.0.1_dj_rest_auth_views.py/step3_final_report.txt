{
  "purpose": "The code implements user authentication, session management, JWT token handling, password reset, and user detail management within a Django REST Framework application.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from POST requests (e.g., username, password, tokens, email). Accesses request.user for user details.",
  "sinks": "Uses tokens (JWT or token model) for authentication; sets cookies; interacts with database to delete tokens; calls login/logout functions; handles token blacklisting.",
  "flows": "Input data (credentials, tokens) flows from request to serializer validation, then to token generation or user login. Tokens are stored or sent in responses. Logout deletes tokens and clears cookies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of nested imports for optional JWT support is standard. No unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard Django REST Framework authentication patterns, with proper handling of JWT and session tokens, including blacklisting and cookie management. No malicious or suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, and no hardcoded secrets are present. The logic is clear, well-structured, and adheres to best practices. The security measures, such as token invalidation and cookie handling, are implemented correctly. The overall risk is low, and the code does not exhibit signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, secure, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, which accurately reflects the low but non-zero inherent risks of authentication modules. The reports are consistent and justified.",
