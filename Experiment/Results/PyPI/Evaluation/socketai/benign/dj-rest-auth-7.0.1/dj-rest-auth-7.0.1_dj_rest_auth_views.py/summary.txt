  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, secure, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, which accurately reflects the low but non-zero inherent risks of authentication modules. The reports are consistent and justified."
