  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the presence of issues, evaluate the reasoning, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes standard login, token issuance, and session management.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. Use of token blacklisting and JWT cookies is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with typical secure practices. No suspicious or malicious behavior identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable given the description.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly details authentication, token handling, and JWT cookie management.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; the code appears standard and secure.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment appears accurate and well-founded.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard authentication flows with JWT support and token blacklisting.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The logic is consistent with best practices; no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly describes typical login/logout, token management, and user data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Mentions optional JWT support.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Well-reasoned; the code appears secure and standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Properly details authentication workflows, token issuance, refresh, and blacklisting.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation. Handles tokens securely.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Reasoning aligns with secure practices; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's evaluation appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Critical Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports agree that the code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None detected; reasoning is consistent and thorough.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are 0, which is justified given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Risk scores:** All at 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern, which is reasonable for well-implemented auth code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** No unwarranted claims; reports rely on standard security analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security risk score:** 0.2 (standard minimal risk for authentication code, assuming correct configuration)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, secure, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The reports' assessments and scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No issues or malicious activity detected.  \n- Scores are appropriate and aligned with the analysis.  \n- The code is a typical, well-structured authentication module with no supply chain risks.",
