  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, obfuscation, and overall security risks, and verify the consistency of the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard user auth, session, and token handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns. Use of token blacklisting and JWT cookies is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, well-structured, no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. The low security risk score seems appropriate given the standard practices. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar user auth functions, with JWT and token management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Proper JWT handling and token blacklisting are present.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. The reasoning is sound. No red flags.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard auth, with JWT and token handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Token blacklisting and cookie management are handled properly.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Looks legitimate, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable and consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard auth with JWT, token blacklisting, and password management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Token blacklisting and cookie handling are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, best practices followed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-founded reasoning. No red flags.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard auth, token management, JWT, session.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets. Optional JWT support is handled via conditional imports.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Typical, secure implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the reasoning shows no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, with no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0.2 across all reports, indicating low risk, which is appropriate given the standard, well-maintained code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code snippets are standard Django REST Framework authentication views.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present.\n- Token blacklisting, JWT cookie management, and session handling follow best practices.\n- The reasoning in all reports aligns with the code's structure and behavior.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (low, standard security considerations)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. The code appears secure, legitimate, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements.",
