{
  "purpose": "The code provides user authentication, session management, and user data handling for a Django REST Framework application, including login, logout, user details retrieval, and password management.",
  "sources": "User input data from request.data in login, logout, password reset, and password change endpoints; environment variables for settings; request cookies for token management.",
  "sinks": "Session registration via django_login; token generation and deletion; setting cookies for JWT tokens; database access for user and token models; potential response modifications with user data.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., login credentials, refresh tokens) flows into serializers and token handling functions; upon success, tokens or session data are set or deleted; JWT tokens are managed via cookies; responses include tokens or user info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Use of token blacklisting and JWT cookie handling is standard for JWT auth systems. No obfuscated code, malicious imports, or suspicious logic identified. Token management appears standard and secure if settings are configured properly.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical Django REST Framework authentication flows with optional JWT support, session login, and token management. It includes secure handling of sensitive parameters via decorators, and tokens are stored or deleted according to standard practices. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications was found. The token blacklisting and JWT cookie management are implemented with proper error handling. Overall, the code seems to follow best practices for user authentication without hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, well-structured authentication logic with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It implements standard login, logout, and user management functions typical for Django REST Framework projects, with optional JWT support. No malicious or maliciously suspicious elements identified.",
