  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code details, logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes that the code is standard, well-structured, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. It assigns malware and obfuscated scores as 0, with a low security risk (0.2).\n\n- **Evaluation:** The code handles user authentication, password resets, and token management using established Django and allauth practices. No suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The validation procedures are appropriate, and the error handling is standard.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. The scores seem reasonable given the lack of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard security practices, proper validation, and no signs of malicious activity. Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0.2.\n\n- **Evaluation:** The code's flow—validating credentials, decoding tokens, handling password resets—is typical and secure. No suspicious external calls or malicious patterns are detected.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report again finds the code to be standard, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, assigning malware and obfuscated scores as 0.\n\n- **Evaluation:** The code's handling of user credentials, token validation, and password resets follows best practices. No anomalies or suspicious external interactions are present.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is consistent and the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar conclusion—standard implementation, no malicious activity, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n\n- **Evaluation:** The code's validation, token handling, and conditional support for allauth are typical for Django projects. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Verdict:** The assessment and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports—standard, secure, no malicious or obfuscated code, malware score at 0.\n\n- **Evaluation:** The code's flow and validation are standard. No external suspicious activity or malicious logic is evident.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning and scoring are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code analysis showing no malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, consistent with the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above 0.2, at 0.2, which is reasonable given the nature of the code—handling sensitive data but no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Security Risk Score:** 0.2 — Slight risk due to handling of sensitive credentials, but no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' assessments are accurate and reasonable. The code appears secure, well-implemented, and free from malicious intent or obfuscation.",
