  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code details, validation logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. It notes proper validation, error handling, and standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score (0.2) aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious code. The malware score of 0 is appropriate, given no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes standard, secure handling of user credentials, tokens, and password workflows. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning aligns with the code’s behavior. The low risk score is justified; no suspicious activity is evident.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No adjustment necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is described as standard, secure, and following best practices. No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the detailed analysis. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing standard validation, proper handling of tokens, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n- **Justification:** The code’s logic and flow are standard and secure; the scores reflect that.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: standard, secure, no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the detailed review.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the code clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 across all reports indicates low risk, which aligns with the code's behavior and analysis.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\nBased on the detailed code review and the consistency of the reports, I concur with the assigned scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**No adjustments needed.** The code appears to be a standard, well-implemented authentication module with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code, and a low security risk score is justified.",
