  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles user auth, password resets, tokens, with support for allauth. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The logic appears standard and secure. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The low risk score aligns with this.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment seems reasonable. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified given the code's structure.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing secure handling of credentials, tokens, and password resets. No malicious activity or obfuscation observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes the standard practices and lack of suspicious behavior. The low malware score is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard serializers with proper validation, token handling, and support for allauth. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code's structure and logic.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard validation, token management, with support for allauth. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The code's flow and validation are typical, with no malicious indicators.\n\n**Conclusion:** The evaluation appears justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard implementation of serializers, no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious external calls.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code review.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's conclusions are sound.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, citing no malicious activity or obfuscation. The code is standard, using Django and allauth libraries, with no suspicious external calls or hidden code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the clarity and standard structure.\n- **Risk Score:** Uniformly low at 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern beyond general best practices. No signs of vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious external activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, standard, and well-structured.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0.2 — slightly above zero, acknowledging the complexity of authentication flows but justified given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n**Note:** The code relies on well-established libraries and patterns, with conditional imports based on installed apps, which is typical in Django projects. No hidden behaviors or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0              |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2            |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the code appears secure, standard, and free from malicious intent or obfuscation.",
