{
  "purpose": "Determine and retrieve the token model used for authentication based on application settings in a Django project.",
  "sources": "Reads from api_settings (TOKEN_MODEL, SESSION_LOGIN, USE_JWT), and from Django's settings.INSTALLED_APPS",
  "sinks": "Potentially the token model returned, which could be used in authentication mechanisms",
  "flows": "Reads configuration from api_settings, verifies conditions, raises exceptions if misconfigured, returns token_model",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual dynamic code execution, no suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports settings and exceptions, defines a function to select the token model based on custom settings, performs validation checks, raises configuration errors if invalid, and returns the model. No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, or malicious code patterns are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with standard Django configuration practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration utility for selecting an authentication token model, with proper validation and error handling. No malicious intent or malicious code detected.",
