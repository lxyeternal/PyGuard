  "purpose": "Determine the token model configuration for Django REST Framework authentication setup.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration settings from `api_settings`, `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`, and environment/configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "Potentially raises `ImproperlyConfigured` exceptions based on configuration validation.",
  "flows": "Validation logic checks configuration parameters (`TOKEN_MODEL`, `SESSION_LOGIN`, `USE_JWT`) and verifies presence of `rest_framework.authtoken` in `INSTALLED_APPS`.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated logic; standard configuration validation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports configuration and exception handling modules. It retrieves token-related settings from a custom `api_settings`. It raises errors if no authentication method is configured or if the token model is misconfigured without the necessary app included. The logic is straightforward, primarily validating configurations. No external inputs, no data leaks, and no malicious behaviors detected. The code performs standard setup validation for Django authentication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration validation script for Django REST Framework authentication. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident. It ensures proper setup and raises errors for misconfigurations but does not perform any harmful actions.",
