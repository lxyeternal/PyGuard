  "purpose": "Configure and retrieve the token model for authentication based on application settings.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration values from `api_settings` and `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`.",
  "sinks": "Potentially raises `ImproperlyConfigured` exceptions if configuration is invalid.",
  "flows": "Reads from configuration variables (`api_settings.TOKEN_MODEL`, `api_settings.SESSION_LOGIN`, `api_settings.USE_JWT`), then either raises exceptions or returns the token model.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code performs configuration validation and raises errors if misconfigured.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration settings related to authentication models and validation flags. It ensures at least one authentication method is enabled and that the token model is properly configured. It raises exceptions if misconfigurations are detected, such as missing `rest_framework.authtoken` in `INSTALLED_APPS` when the default token model is used. No malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. The code's purpose is straightforward configuration validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard configuration validation logic for authentication setup, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
