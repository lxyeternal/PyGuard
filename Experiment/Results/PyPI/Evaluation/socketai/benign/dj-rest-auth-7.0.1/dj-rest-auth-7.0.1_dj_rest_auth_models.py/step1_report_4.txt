  "purpose": "Configure and retrieve the token model for authentication in a Django REST Framework application.",
  "sources": "api_settings.TOKEN_MODEL, api_settings.SESSION_LOGIN, api_settings.USE_JWT, settings.INSTALLED_APPS",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present that handle untrusted data directly; configuration values are used for internal logic.",
  "flows": "Configuration values from api_settings influence the decision-making process in get_token_model(). No direct data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code performs standard configuration validation.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves configuration parameters related to authentication setup. It raises exceptions if no authentication method is configured or if required apps are missing from INSTALLED_APPS. All operations are based on static configuration values. No external data input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration validation for Django REST Framework authentication settings. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The logic is straightforward and only validates configurations.",
