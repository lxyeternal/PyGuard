  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Configure and retrieve token model.\n- Source: Reads from `api_settings` and `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`.\n- Sink: Raises `ImproperlyConfigured` if misconfigured.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: Straightforward validation; no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Standard configuration validation.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0\n\n**Assessment:** No issues, scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Configure and retrieve token model.\n- Source: Reads from `api_settings`, Django settings.\n- Sink: Raises exceptions if misconfigured.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: Standard validation; no malicious code.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The securityRisk score is 0.1, indicating minimal concern, which seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Determine token model configuration.\n- Source: Reads from `api_settings`, `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`.\n- Sink: Raises exceptions if invalid.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: Straightforward validation.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Configure and retrieve token model.\n- Source: Reads from `api_settings`, Django settings.\n- Sink: No explicit untrusted data handling.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard validation.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Determine token model.\n- Source: Reads from `api_settings`, Django settings.\n- Sink: Returns token model.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Straightforward validation.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly indicate 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are 0, matching the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal risk associated with configuration validation code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is standard Django configuration validation, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- The slight security risk score of 0.1 in some reports accounts for potential misconfigurations leading to security issues, but the code itself does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect that misconfigurations could lead to security issues if not properly handled, but the code itself is safe)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and minimal security risk primarily due to configuration errors rather than code flaws.",
