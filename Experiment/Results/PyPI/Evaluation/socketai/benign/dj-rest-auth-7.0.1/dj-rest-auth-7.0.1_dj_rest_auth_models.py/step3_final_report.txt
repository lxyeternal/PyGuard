  "purpose": "Configuration validation for token model and authentication settings in a Django application.",
  "sources": "Reads from `api_settings` and Django `settings.INSTALLED_APPS` to determine token model and authentication configuration.",
  "sinks": "Raises `ImproperlyConfigured` exceptions if configuration is invalid or incomplete.",
  "flows": "Reads configuration parameters from `api_settings` and Django settings; raises exceptions upon misconfiguration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward validation of authentication configuration, ensuring at least one method is enabled and that the default token model is properly registered in Django's installed apps. No external data inputs, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The logic is clear, and exception handling is standard for configuration validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration validation routine with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate, reflecting a benign and well-structured validation process.",
