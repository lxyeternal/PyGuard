  "purpose": "This script is designed to facilitate running Django tests for the 'dj_rest_auth' package using 'setup.py test'.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', import statements, dynamic test directory path, and the 'get_runner' function from django.test.utils.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "The script sets environment variables, modifies sys.path, initializes Django settings, and runs tests, with no indication of untrusted data flow to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; code appears to be standard testing setup for a Django project.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, sets an environment variable for Django settings, modifies sys.path for test discovery, initializes the Django test environment, and executes the test suite. All operations are standard for running Django tests in a controlled environment. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is evident. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical testing harness for a Django package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and intended for testing purposes.",
