{
  "purpose": "Standard Django test runner setup script used for executing tests in the 'dj_rest_auth' package.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', imports of os, sys, django modules, and filesystem path modifications.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit() call based on test results, which terminates the process with success or failure status.",
  "flows": "Environment variable setting and sys.path modification lead to test runner invocation, culminating in process exit.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious external communications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django testing bootstrap: it sets environment variables, adjusts sys.path, initializes Django if possible, runs tests on 'dj_rest_auth', and exits with the test outcome. No malicious behavior, network activity, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code adheres to standard practices and is transparent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign, standard Django test setup with no malicious intent or security risks. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The high confidence scores are justified given the code's clarity and typical usage.",
