  "purpose": "Set up and run Django tests for the dj_rest_auth package during setup.py test execution.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', import statements, filesystem paths, and the test runner invocation.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit based on test failures, potential indirect access via imported modules if malicious code is present within them.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' influences Django setup; test runner executes tests in 'dj_rest_auth' directory; sys.exit communicates test results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code structures, no obfuscated code or hidden behavior detected. The code is a standard test runner setup.",
  "analysis": "The code configures environment variables for Django, adjusts sys.path to include a specific test directory, and executes Django's test runner for the 'dj_rest_auth' package. The imports are standard Django testing modules, and there are no indications of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a typical setup script for running tests, with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Django testing setup with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It solely facilitates running tests for a package. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are detected.",
