  "purpose": "This script sets up and runs Django tests for the dj_rest_auth package, facilitating testing via setup.py.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', the 'test_dir' path derived from __file__, and Django settings import.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily configures testing environment and executes tests without external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Environment variable assignment and path setup influence Django test runner execution, but no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard Django testing setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, sets environment variables, adjusts sys.path for testing, defines a function to run tests using Django's test utilities, and executes it if run as main. All actions are typical for a testing setup. No hardcoded secrets, external network activity, or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing harness for Django applications, with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks.",
