{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'dj-rest-auth' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md, executing version info from '__version__.py'.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly processes untrusted input or outputs untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reading files to obtain package info, executing version file to load version variable.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of external version file using exec(), which could potentially be malicious if the version file is tampered with. No validation of the executed content.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs setup configuration for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file, executes the version file to retrieve the package version, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. The use of exec() to load version information from an external file is a potential security concern if the version file is compromised, as it could execute arbitrary code. Other parts of the script are standard for Python package setup and do not contain suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with the notable point being the use of exec() to load version info, which could be exploited if the version file is malicious. No other malicious behavior or malware signs are evident. Overall, the risk is low but warrants caution regarding the version file.",
