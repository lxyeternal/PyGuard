{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script configures the packaging of the dj-rest-auth Python module, including metadata, dependencies, and versioning.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; reads and executes __version__.py to obtain version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Reads version file (__version__.py) and executes its content to assign version info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to evaluate version file content, which could be risky if the file is compromised, but is a common pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It reads static files and calls setup() with metadata and dependencies. The only notable operation is the use of exec() on __version__.py, which is typical but could pose security risks if the version file is tampered with. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is detected. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is present. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward. The security risk score is low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting the potential risk associated with exec() but considering the context as a trusted setup script. Overall, the package appears safe, with minimal security concerns primarily related to the trustworthiness of the version file.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, safe setup configuration with a minor security consideration regarding the use of exec() for version loading. No malware or obfuscation detected. Maintaining the integrity of the version file is recommended to mitigate risks associated with exec().",
