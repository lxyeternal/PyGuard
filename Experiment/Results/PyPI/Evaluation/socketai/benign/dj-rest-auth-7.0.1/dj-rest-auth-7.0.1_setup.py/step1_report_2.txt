{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the Python package 'dj-rest-auth', used to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, executing content of '__version__.py' to get version info, package discovery with find_packages(), and listing dependencies in install_requires and extras_require.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks are present; the script primarily reads static files and executes version file content. No untrusted data handling or network operations detected.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> reading version info from __version__.py -> setting up package configuration with static metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed. Use of 'exec' to run version file could be risky if the version file is tampered, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts and unlikely to be malicious in this context.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: reading a README file for long description, executing a version file to extract version info, and configuring package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic or unsafe code execution beyond 'exec' in a controlled context. No network activity, no obfuscated code, and no hidden behavior. The use of 'exec' is typical in setup scripts and does not indicate malicious intent, assuming the version file is trusted.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, though the use of 'exec' warrants basic trust in the version file. Overall, it is safe and normal for its purpose.",
