  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'dj-rest-auth' Python package, configuring metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file; executing version info from '__version__.py'; importing and executing setuptools functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or user input; package dependencies are specified but not executed or validated at runtime.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setting up package metadata -> executing version file -> configuring setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to run contents of '__version__.py' — common in setup scripts, but potentially risky if the file is tampered with. No suspicious code or malicious patterns found. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks: reading a README file, executing a version file to get package version info, and configuring package metadata and dependencies. The 'exec' call, while standard in setup scripts, can be risky if the version file is maliciously altered; however, in this context, it is standard practice and unlikely malicious. No other suspicious behavior, such as network activity, data leaks, or malicious code, is present. All dependencies are standard and from trusted sources. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. The use of 'exec' is common in such scripts but should be verified to ensure the version file is trustworthy. Overall, the package appears safe.",
