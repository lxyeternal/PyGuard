  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the setup script is standard, with no malicious code or suspicious behavior.\n- The primary concern across reports is the use of `exec()` to load version info from `__version__.py`.\n- No reports identify actual malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the minor concern about `exec()`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code itself is straightforward and matches the description. No issues are found that are not already acknowledged by the reports.\n- The use of `exec()` is standard but can be risky if the version file is tampered with, which is correctly noted.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the use of `exec()` as a potential risk but note that it is common practice.\n- No false claims or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The reasoning that no malicious behavior is present is sound.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- Security risk scores are slightly higher (0.2) in some reports, reflecting the `exec()` concern. This is reasonable.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.8–0.9), consistent with the careful analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk > 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- The only minor concern is the use of `exec()`, which is standard but could be exploited if the version file is compromised.\n- Given the context, the risk scores are justified as low but not zero.\n\n### Malware scores:\n- All reports correctly assign malware = 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- This aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- No reports rely on unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge the `exec()` pattern and its risks.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the reports' reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on all the information:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscated code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minor concern about `exec()`, but overall very low risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (acknowledging the `exec()` concern but considering it standard practice)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent. The main point of caution is ensuring the integrity of `__version__.py` to prevent potential code execution risks. Overall, the package appears safe and well-understood.",
