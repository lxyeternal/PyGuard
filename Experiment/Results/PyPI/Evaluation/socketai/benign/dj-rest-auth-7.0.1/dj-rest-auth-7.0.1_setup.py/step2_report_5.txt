  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details of the setup script, the potential risks, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe a typical Python setup script, primarily reading static files (README.md, __version__.py) and configuring package metadata.\n- The only potentially risky operation is the use of `exec()` to evaluate the contents of `__version__.py`.\n- No reports identify any malicious code, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious patterns.\n- The overall confidence in each report's assessment is high (0.8–0.9), and all agree that the code is standard and safe, with a minor concern about `exec()`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of `exec()`**: All reports correctly identify that using `exec()` on `__version__.py` can be risky if the file is tampered with. However, this is a common pattern in setup scripts for dynamic versioning, assuming the version file is trusted.\n- **No malicious code or behavior**: No evidence of malware, backdoors, obfuscation, or data leaks.\n- **Dependencies**: All dependencies are standard and from trusted sources.\n\n### Errors or flaws in reasoning:\n\n- The reports seem consistent and accurate. They recognize the `exec()` pattern as a potential security concern but also note its commonality.\n- No report claims any actual malicious activity or code.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n\n- **Malware score (0)**: Appropriate; no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated score (0)**: Correct; code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk scores (~0.1–0.2)**: Reasonable, given the `exec()` concern but no actual malicious activity.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk > 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- The minor risk stems from the use of `exec()`, which could be exploited if the version file is maliciously altered. However, in a controlled environment, this is considered low risk.\n\n### Consistency and recommendations:\n\n- All reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The scores align with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** (slightly above zero due to `exec()` concern, but overall low)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe setup script is standard, with no malicious or obfuscated code. The only minor concern is the use of `exec()`, which should be used cautiously, but this is common practice. The package appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate                     | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                                   | No malicious code or activity detected.                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                                   | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.                     |\n| Security risk    | 0.1–0.2                             | Due to `exec()` pattern, but generally low risk.            |\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
