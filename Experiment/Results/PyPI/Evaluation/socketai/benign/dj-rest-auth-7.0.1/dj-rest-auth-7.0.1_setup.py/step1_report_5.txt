  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'dj-rest-auth' Python package, including dependency specifications and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description; reads version information from '__version__.py' within the 'dj_rest_auth' package.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used in a manner that could lead to data leaks or malicious execution.",
  "flows": "Reads version info, then executes it to populate the 'about' dictionary; uses this info in setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to run code from a file ('__version__.py') could potentially be risky if the file is tampered with, but this is a common practice for dynamic versioning. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads package metadata and dependencies to prepare for package distribution. The use of 'exec' on the version file is a known pattern, but it can pose risks if the version file is compromised. No other suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. All dependencies and data are static and controlled within the package. No external data sources or sinks are involved in a manner that would indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The only minor concern is the use of 'exec' to load version info, which is common but should ensure the version file is secure.",
