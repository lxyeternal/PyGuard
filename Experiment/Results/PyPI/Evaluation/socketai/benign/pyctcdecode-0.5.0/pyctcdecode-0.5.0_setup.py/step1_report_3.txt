  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, intended to configure package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'setuptools' library import; no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; no output or data transmission points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; minimal flow as it only calls setup() with no parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from the 'setuptools' library and executes 'setup()' with default parameters. There are no inputs, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks, and no suspicious logic. This is a standard minimal setup script for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical minimal setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
