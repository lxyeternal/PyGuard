{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package related to speech or language processing, importing core classes and functions for alphabet handling, decoding, and language modeling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .alphabet, .decoder, .language_model",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious activity; code primarily performs imports",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from sources to sinks; just module imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures; straightforward import statements with no embedded logic",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific classes and functions from local modules within the package. There is no data processing, user input, or external network activity. The import statements include 'noqa' comments to suppress linter warnings, which is common in clean, well-maintained packages. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code snippet is minimal and serves as a part of the package’s module initialization or structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard for a Python package's internal module setup, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply imports components necessary for the package’s functionality. There are no indications of supply chain attacks or malicious intent.",
