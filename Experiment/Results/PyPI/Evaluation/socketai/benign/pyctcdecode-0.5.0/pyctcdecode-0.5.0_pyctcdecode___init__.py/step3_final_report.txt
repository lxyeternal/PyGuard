{
  "purpose": "This code snippet imports local modules related to alphabet processing, decoding, and language modeling, likely as part of a larger speech or language processing system.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .alphabet, .decoder, .language_model",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; static import statements with no runtime data handling",
  "flows": "N/A – static imports without data flow or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import statements with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing classes and functions from local modules. There is no runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or embedded secrets. The use of '# noqa' indicates linting suppression, not malicious intent. The code is typical for a modular Python package, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. All security signals point to benign, standard code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of import statements with no security concerns, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The initial reports correctly identify the benign nature, and the scores should be set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
