  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports components related to alphabet processing, decoding, and language modeling, likely for speech or language processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .alphabet, .decoder, and .language_model",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data output operations are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable here as the code only performs imports without processing or data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns are present. The code is straightforward and consists solely of import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, indicating modular design. No input reading, data manipulation, or external communication is present. It does not contain any code execution or handling untrusted data, reducing risk. The code does not include obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement module, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger system related to speech or language processing. No malicious intent or security threats are evident.",
