  "purpose": "This code imports classes and functions related to alphabet processing, beam search decoding, and language modeling, likely for a speech or language processing library.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules: alphabet, decoder, language_model.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing happening within this snippet; no untrusted data handling or output functions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted data handling present in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. The code only contains straightforward import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with no runtime logic, data handling, or suspicious constructs. It references modules that may perform processing elsewhere, but this snippet itself does not contain any security issues or malicious behavior. The presence of standard import syntax and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code reduces concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module import section of a larger project related to language or speech processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or security risks within this snippet.",
