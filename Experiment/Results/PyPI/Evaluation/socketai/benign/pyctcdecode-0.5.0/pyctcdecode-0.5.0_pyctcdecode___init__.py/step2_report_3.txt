  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the provided code snippet.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\n# Copyright 2021-present Kensho Technologies, LLC.\nfrom .alphabet import Alphabet  # noqa\nfrom .decoder import BeamSearchDecoderCTC, build_ctcdecoder  # noqa\nfrom .language_model import LanguageModel  # noqa\n```\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- The code consists solely of import statements from local modules.\n- There are no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n- The `# noqa` comments suggest code style compliance, not obfuscation.\n- No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger package related to speech or language processing.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as importing modules related to alphabet, decoding, and language modeling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No anomalies or malicious behavior; standard import statements.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no issues. The security risk score is very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the import of local modules.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity or anomalies; standard import pattern.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; no security concerns. The security risk score is appropriately zero.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as importing modules for speech/language processing.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic code or external data flows; minimal risk.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as module imports.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No data processing or suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; straightforward, benign code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code is for internal package setup.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; standard import pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Overall evaluation:\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is purely import statements with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The security risk scores are very low or zero, reflecting minimal concern.\n- The confidence levels are high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 or very close to it, given the absence of any security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThis code snippet is a standard, benign set of import statements forming part of a larger language or speech processing package. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores provided in the reports are appropriate and should not be increased.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment is consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
