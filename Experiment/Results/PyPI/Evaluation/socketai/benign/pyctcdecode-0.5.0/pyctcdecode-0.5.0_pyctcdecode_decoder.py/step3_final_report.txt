  "purpose": "Implementation of a CTC beam search decoder with optional language model and hotword support, including model saving/loading and multiprocessing batch decoding.",
  "sources": "Reads input logits, loads models from files or directories, reads configuration files, and generates unique model keys using os.urandom.",
  "sinks": "File I/O for saving/loading models; no network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Logits processed to generate beams; beams scored with LM and hotword scores; beams merged, pruned, and sorted; final decoded text produced.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.urandom for generating model instance keys is standard; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of a CTC beam search decoder with external dependencies for language modeling. No malicious or sabotage behavior is evident. External libraries are used appropriately for model management. No signs of obfuscation or malicious logic. The scoring and file handling are typical for such systems. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are justified. The security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects minimal operational risks related to external dependencies and file operations, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The low security risk score is appropriate given the context. All reports' assessments are consistent and justified.",
