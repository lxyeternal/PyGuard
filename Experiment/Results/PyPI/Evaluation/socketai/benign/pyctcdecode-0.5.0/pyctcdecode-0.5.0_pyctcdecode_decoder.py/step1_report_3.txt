{
  "purpose": "The code implements a CTC beam search decoder for speech recognition models, supporting hotword boosting, language model integration, and multiprocessing.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files, alphabet JSON, and language model directories during load functions; reads input logits during decoding.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead untrusted data to harm or leak; no network communication or system modifications present.",
  "flows": "Input logits are processed through softmax/log softmax, passed into beam search which updates beams and scores, and outputs decoded text or beams.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.urandom for model key generation is standard; no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors detected; no obfuscated code or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a CTC decoder with optional language model integration. It includes functions for managing multiprocessing, file I/O for model loading/saving, and beam search procedures. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. The code handles hotword scoring, beam pruning, and sequence scoring in a typical manner. The use of kenlm bindings is for language modeling only. The only somewhat unusual part is the model container managed via class variable, but this is typical for large models to avoid re-loading. No suspicious or malicious logic was found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CTC decoding module with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It manages models, performs beam search, and handles input/output securely without any signs of sabotage or malware.",
