{
  "purpose": "Define default parameters and constants for a decoding process, likely related to speech or language model decoding.",
  "sources": "None; the code only assigns constants and imports the math module.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is a simple set of constant definitions without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. No obfuscation or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the math library and defines several constants used for decoding parameters, including alpha, beta, log probability offsets, beam width, and others. All variables are straightforward constants, with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. The LOG_BASE_CHANGE_FACTOR calculates a conversion factor for logarithm bases, which is mathematically sound and standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup of constants for a decoding algorithm. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident from the provided snippet.",
