  "purpose": "Define default parameters and constants for a decoding process, likely in a speech or language model context.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; all parameters are hardcoded constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only sets constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the constants are typical for decoding algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code sets various default parameters and constants for a decoding process, such as beam width, weights, and log probabilities. All parameters are statically defined and do not involve external inputs or sensitive data handling. The only operation involves a mathematical constant calculation using math.log10 and math.e, which is standard. There is no code execution, input reading, or potential for malicious activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, setting parameters for a decoding algorithm. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no indicators of malware. It appears to be standard configuration code.",
