{
  "purpose": "Define constants and parameters for a decoding process, likely in speech or language models.",
  "sources": "Constants are defined directly within the code; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present; static constants only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward constant definitions with a correct mathematical calculation for log base change.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the math module and defines several constants related to decoding parameters, including alpha, beta, beam width, log probability offsets, and a calculation for converting log bases. There are no functions, data processing, external input/output, or dynamic code execution. The calculation of LOG_BASE_CHANGE_FACTOR is mathematically correct. The code is simple, static, and free of obfuscation or malicious behavior. All signals indicate benign configuration constants with no security risks or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward configuration snippet for a decoding process, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. It is safe and does not pose any security risks.",
