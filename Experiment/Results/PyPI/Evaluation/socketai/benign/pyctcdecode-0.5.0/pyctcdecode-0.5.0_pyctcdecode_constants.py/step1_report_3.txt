{
  "purpose": "Define default parameters and constants for a decoding process, likely related to speech or language model decoding.",
  "sources": "Constants and parameters are defined directly in the code; no input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that process untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive operations; code only sets constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. Constants such as log probabilities and beam width are standard for decoding algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code solely initializes constants related to decoding parameters, such as alpha, beta, beam width, and log probability offsets. It imports the math module for mathematical calculations, specifically for log conversions. There are no functions, input handling, data processing, or external communications. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup of configuration parameters for a decoding process, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
