{
  "purpose": "Define default parameters and constants for a decoding process, likely related to speech or language model inference.",
  "sources": "No input sources; code only sets constants and parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static assignment of constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code consists of simple parameter definitions and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the math module and establishes various constants for decoding purposes, such as alpha, beta, beam width, and log probabilities. These parameters are standard and do not contain any suspicious or malicious code. No input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, or hidden behavior is present. The constants appear to be for configuring a decoding algorithm, possibly for speech recognition or language modeling, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of parameter definitions for a decoding process, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
