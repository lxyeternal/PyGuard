  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the original code snippet.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining constants and parameters for a decoding process, likely related to speech or language models.\n- They consistently state that the code is straightforward, with no external data handling, no functions, and no suspicious behaviors.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issue presence:** The code does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies. It is purely constant definitions.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are apparent; the constants are standard for such decoding tasks.\n- **Scores:** The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable given the code.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The **malware score** of 0 is justified; there's no malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** of 0 is justified; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The **risk score** of 0 is justified; no security risks are evident.\n\n### Any potential concerns?\n- The only aspect that could be questioned is whether the constants could be exploited if misused, but as they are just configuration parameters, that risk is minimal.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly avoid speculation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### My own estimates:\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed review.",
