{
  "purpose": "Define default parameters and constants for a decoding process, likely related to language model or speech recognition tasks.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code only defines constants and imports math module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or processing flows involving untrusted data; the code only sets constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the math module and defines a series of constants with fixed values for decoding parameters. These constants include thresholds, weights, and offsets, which are standard for configuring a decoding algorithm. The variables are hardcoded and do not involve any data manipulation, external input, or complex logic. No functions, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. The code appears to be straightforward parameter definitions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is purely definitional with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves as a configuration setup for a decoding process.",
