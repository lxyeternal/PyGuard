  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the original code snippet.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward set of constant definitions related to decoding parameters.\n- No dynamic logic, data handling, external input/output, or obfuscation is present.\n- All reports consistently identify the code as benign configuration constants.\n- The only calculation of note is `LOG_BASE_CHANGE_FACTOR`, which correctly converts log bases.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code does not contain any bugs, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior. It is purely definitional.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  No. The reports correctly interpret the code as benign, with no anomalies or malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk)?**  \n  All reports assign `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they only describe the code's static constants.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Since the code is only defining constants with no malicious behavior, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score justification:**  \n  No obfuscation is present; all constants are straightforward, so 0 is correct.\n\n- **Risk score justification:**  \n  The code does not pose any security risk; thus, 0 is justified.\n\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  No. The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven all the above, I agree with the reports' conclusions and scores. The code is a benign configuration snippet with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, straightforward, and contains no security issues. No further action or increased scores are warranted.",
