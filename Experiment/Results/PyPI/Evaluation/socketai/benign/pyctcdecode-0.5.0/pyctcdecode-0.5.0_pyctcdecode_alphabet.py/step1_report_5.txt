{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to handle, normalize, and verify token alphabets for text processing models, including BPE and regular alphabet types.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; data is passed through function arguments such as 'labels' and 'unigrams'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions; mainly logging and returning processed data.",
  "flows": "Input 'labels' are checked and normalized, then encapsulated in an 'Alphabet' object; verification functions analyze alphabet coverage.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard processing for token alphabets, including style detection, normalization, and validation. Logging is used for informational and warning purposes. No external network access, system modifications, or data exfiltration routines are present. Functions strictly operate on provided data structures, with no evident malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation for managing token alphabets in NLP models. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It performs normalization, validation, and serialization of alphabet data in a secure manner.",
