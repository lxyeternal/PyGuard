  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for handling BPE and regular tokenization alphabets, including normalization, verification, and serialization.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (labels), internal regex patterns, and logging statements; no external untrusted input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "JSON serialization/deserialization, logging, and in-memory data processing; no external system calls or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input labels are processed through regex matching and normalization routines; no external data flows or untrusted data leading to system effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; standard regex and logging are used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code performs alphabet normalization, validation, and serialization for NLP token sets. It uses regex to identify special tokens, normalizes labels accordingly, and includes validation checks for duplicates and space tokens. No external system interactions, network activity, or code execution of untrusted data is present. The routines are straightforward, well-structured, and typical for NLP preprocessing. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for NLP alphabet handling with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with its functionality.",
