{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions and classes to handle token alphabets for natural language processing tasks, including normalization, verification, and serialization/deserialization of alphabet data.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'labels' parameter in various functions and class methods; logs and regex patterns are used internally for processing.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include JSON serialization/deserialization and logging. No data is written to external systems or network. No untrusted input is directly used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input labels are processed through normalization functions, then verified and stored in an Alphabet instance, with optional serialization/deserialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present. Use of regex for token pattern matching is standard. Logging is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manipulates token labels, normalizing them based on patterns and conventions for BPE or regular alphabet types. It includes functions to check alphabet style, normalize tokens, verify properties, and serialize/deserialize the alphabet object. No external network calls, system modifications, or suspicious code flows are present. The use of regex, logging, and data handling appears standard for NLP preprocessing. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is well-structured, with explicit comments and input validation. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, benign utility module for handling token alphabets in NLP pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard utility for managing token alphabets with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs normalization, verification, and serialization tasks typical in NLP preprocessing.",
