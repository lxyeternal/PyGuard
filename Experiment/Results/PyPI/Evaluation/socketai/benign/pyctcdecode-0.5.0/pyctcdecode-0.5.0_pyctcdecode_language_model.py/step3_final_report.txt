  "purpose": "Provides utilities for managing language models, hotword scoring, serialization, and model loading in NLP applications.",
  "sources": "File I/O for loading models, unigrams, and serialized attributes; pattern matching for hotwords; environment variables for optional dependencies.",
  "sinks": "File writing for model serialization; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Reads model files and unigrams; writes serialized attributes and unigrams; loads kenlm models; performs pattern matching for hotwords.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. Use of warnings for optional kenlm bindings is standard. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code manages language model serialization, scoring, and hotword detection using standard libraries and practices. No external network calls or malicious behaviors are present. The optional kenlm dependency is handled gracefully. Serialization involves copying model files and writing unigrams and attributes, which is typical. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured utility code for NLP language modeling and hotword detection. No signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation are present. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is zero.",
