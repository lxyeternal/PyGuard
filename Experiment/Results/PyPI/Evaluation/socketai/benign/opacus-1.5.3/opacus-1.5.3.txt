The malware score remains 0, and obfuscation is absent. The low risk scores (0.1-0.2) are appropriate but could be standardized to 0 for clarity. Overall, the dependency is safe and suitable for use."

Report 3 warrants close monitoring due to signs of obfuscation and dynamic behavior, with a potential slight increase in malware score if further malicious activity is suspected. The other reports are appropriately scored as low risk."
