  "purpose": "Training MNIST with differential privacy using PyTorch and Opacus, including model evaluation and saving results.",
  "sources": "Data loaded from torchvision datasets, model parameters, privacy engine, and training data loader.",
  "sinks": "Model outputs, saved model and results files, print statements for logs.",
  "flows": "Data from datasets to model, losses computed, privacy accountant updates, results saved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of privacy-preserving MNIST training. It loads data, applies differential privacy via Opacus, trains the model, evaluates, and saves results. No malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The optional secure RNG feature is a legitimate privacy enhancement, not malicious. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses reputable libraries. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The security risk is minimal, justified by the use of privacy tools, and the malware score is zero due to the absence of malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of privacy-preserving ML training with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature of the script.",
