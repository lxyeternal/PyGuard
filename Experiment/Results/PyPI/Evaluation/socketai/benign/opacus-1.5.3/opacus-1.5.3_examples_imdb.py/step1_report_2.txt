{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to train and evaluate a sentiment analysis model on the IMDB movie reviews dataset using differential privacy techniques with Opacus.",
  "sources": "The code loads dataset via 'load_dataset' from the 'datasets' library, and uses 'BertTokenizerFast' for tokenization. It reads command-line arguments for configuration. No other external data inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "The code saves the final accuracy score to a file named 'run_results_imdb_classification.pt'. No other sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data from the IMDB dataset flows through tokenization, batching, and into the model for training and evaluation. Model outputs are used for loss calculation and accuracy measurement. The final accuracy score is saved to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code segments detected. The code appears to be a standard implementation of DP training with Opacus and a simple neural network. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and packages for dataset loading, tokenization, model training, and differential privacy. It processes data with typical preprocessing steps, uses a straightforward neural network, and applies differential privacy via Opacus. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are evident. The data flow is typical for machine learning pipelines. The final save operation stores a numeric value (accuracy) to a file, which is standard. No network communications, data exfiltration, or backdoors are found. The code adheres to normal practices for privacy-preserving ML training.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard differential privacy training script for sentiment analysis. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are detected. The script functions as intended for privacy-aware model training and evaluation.",
