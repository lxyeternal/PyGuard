  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for privacy-preserving MNIST training with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), justified by the use of environment variables and privacy mechanisms. Overall, the code appears secure and benign."
