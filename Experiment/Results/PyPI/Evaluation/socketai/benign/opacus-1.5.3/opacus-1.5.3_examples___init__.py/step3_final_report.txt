  "purpose": "This code serves as a standard Python script header, including a shebang line and licensing comments, with no executable logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "The shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) and licensing comments.",
  "sinks": "None, as there are no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist due to lack of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only comments and a shebang line, with no functions, variables, or executable logic. All reviews correctly identify it as a benign header with no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code poses no threat and is typical in open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless license header with a shebang line. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and the scores reflect its benign nature accurately.",
