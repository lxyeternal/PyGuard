  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard license header and shebang line for a Python script, likely used as part of a larger project.",
  "sources": "The shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) at the top of the file, and the comments providing licensing information.",
  "sinks": "There are no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling sinks present in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is observable in this snippet, as it contains only comments and a shebang line.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present. The code is only a license header and shebang.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a shebang line indicating execution with Python 3 and a licensing comment block. There are no executable statements, function definitions, data processing, or external calls. The license comments are standard and do not introduce any security concerns. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign license header and shebang line with no malicious intent, no security risks, and no obfuscation. It appears to be a standard part of a larger codebase.",
