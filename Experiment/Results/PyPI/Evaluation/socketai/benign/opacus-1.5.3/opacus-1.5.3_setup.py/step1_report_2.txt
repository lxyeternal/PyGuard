{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package called 'opacus' with its metadata, dependencies, and version checks.",
  "sources": "Reads the version from 'opacus/version.py', reads README.md for long description, reads requirements.txt and dev_requirements.txt for dependencies, and reads Python version info from sys module.",
  "sinks": "The sys.exit() call on version mismatch, and potentially executing code from 'opacus/version.py'.",
  "flows": "Version information from 'opacus/version.py' flows into '__version__'. Python version check flows from sys.version_info to sys.exit() if incompatible. Dependencies are read from files and passed to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no use of unsafe eval or exec except for reading version info, which appears standard. The code performs a standard setup routine with no unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical package setup for a Python project. It reads version info from a file, checks Python version compatibility, reads README and requirements files for documentation and dependencies, and calls setup() with package metadata. The use of exec() to load version info from 'version.py' is common in setup scripts, and no malicious behavior is evident. The code does not include any network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All operations are standard for a setup.py script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply manages package metadata, dependencies, and version compatibility checks.",
