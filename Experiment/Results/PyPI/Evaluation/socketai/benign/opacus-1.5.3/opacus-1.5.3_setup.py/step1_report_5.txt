{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'opacus' Python package, including version checking, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'opacus/version.py', reads files 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', 'dev_requirements.txt'; uses 'sys' and 'os' modules for environment and file operations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks that lead to potential data leaks or code execution; setup function is standard for package installation.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> checks Python version -> loads description and requirements -> calls setup() to install package",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or backdoors. Version info loaded dynamically from a file; no user input processed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs environment checks, reads package metadata and requirements, and invokes setuptools.setup() for package installation. All actions are typical for a Python package setup script. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior detected. The dynamic execution of version file is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. No suspicious network or system activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs version checks, reads static files, and runs the setup process securely.",
