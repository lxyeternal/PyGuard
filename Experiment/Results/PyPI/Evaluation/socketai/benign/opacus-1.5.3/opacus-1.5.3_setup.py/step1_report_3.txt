{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'opacus' Python package, used to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'opacus/version.py', reads files ('README.md', 'requirements.txt', 'dev_requirements.txt') from disk, and accesses system information such as Python version.",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; primarily reads files and system info, and calls setup() for package configuration.",
  "flows": "File reads (version and requirements) flow into setup configuration; version info flows from 'version.py' into '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. No dynamic code execution beyond standard exec() for version loading, which is a common pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations: importing modules, checking Python version, reading version and description files, and calling setuptools.setup(). It uses exec() to load version info but within a controlled, standard pattern. No external data is transmitted or received, and there are no suspicious behaviors. The code strictly adheres to common package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious activities. The only noteworthy point is the use of exec() to load version info, which is a common practice in setup scripts.",
