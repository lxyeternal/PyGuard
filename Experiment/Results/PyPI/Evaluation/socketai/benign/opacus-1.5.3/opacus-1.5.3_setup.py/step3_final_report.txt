  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'opacus' Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and environment checks.",
  "sources": "Reads version info via exec() from 'opacus/version.py', reads README.md, requirements.txt, dev_requirements.txt, and performs Python version check.",
  "sinks": "Uses sys.exit() for version enforcement, exec() for dynamic version loading, and setuptools.setup() to install package.",
  "flows": "Version info is loaded via exec() from version.py; environment variables and files are read; setup() is called with package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info, which could be risky if the version.py file is compromised, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup.py script with standard practices. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code detected. The exec() pattern, while slightly risky if the version file is tampered, is widely used and not malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, benign package setup configuration with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The minor security concern regarding exec() is a known pattern and does not indicate malicious intent.",
