  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for general functionality, possibly related to data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be fully determined without seeing the actual code content.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include reading input from user inputs, environment variables, files, or network connections. However, due to lack of specific code, exact sources cannot be identified.",
  "sinks": "Possible sinks involve writing to files, making network requests, executing commands, or handling sensitive data, but specifics are unclear without the actual code.",
  "flows": "The source-to-sink paths are not clearly identifiable without the code details; typically would involve untrusted data flowing into dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior can be identified without code content. No signs of malicious obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "Due to absence of provided code, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Typically, this would involve examining input sources, data flows, and sinks for suspicious activity, but the code is missing.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to determine the presence of malicious behavior. The review cannot be completed without the actual code content.",
