  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly reflect the level of suspicion based on available evidence. Report 3 warrants close monitoring due to signs of obfuscation and dynamic behavior, with a potential slight increase in malware score if further malicious activity is suspected. The other reports are appropriately scored as low risk."
