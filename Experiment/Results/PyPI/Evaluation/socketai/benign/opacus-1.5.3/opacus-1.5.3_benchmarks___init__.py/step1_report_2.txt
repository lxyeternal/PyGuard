  "anomalies": "No code provided, so no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs can be identified.",
  "analysis": "Unable to analyze specific code content; without code, analysis is limited to general considerations. If code contains network requests, environment variable reads, or file operations, these could be points of concern. No malicious behavior or obfuscation can be confirmed without the actual code.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to determine malicious intent or security risks. No specific anomalies or malware indications can be identified without the code content.",
