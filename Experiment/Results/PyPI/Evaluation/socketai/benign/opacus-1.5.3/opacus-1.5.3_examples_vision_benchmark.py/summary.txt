  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, justified by the use of privacy features but no actual threats. The malware score remains 0, and obfuscation is absent. The low risk scores (0.1-0.2) are appropriate but could be standardized to 0 for clarity. Overall, the dependency is safe and suitable for use."
