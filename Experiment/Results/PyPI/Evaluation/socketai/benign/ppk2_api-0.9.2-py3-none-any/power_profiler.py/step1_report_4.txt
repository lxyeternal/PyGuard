{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Python class for interfacing with a power profiling device (PPK2), managing measurements, and logging data to CSV.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from parameters and serial port discovery; calls to ppk2_api methods for data acquisition and device control.",
  "sinks": "Writes data to CSV files; no data flows explicitly to network or external systems within this code.",
  "flows": "Source: device initialization and measurement triggers -> device data retrieval -> CSV file writing; no external untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution. Thread management appears standard. No suspicious network calls or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for controlling a hardware power profiling device, including device discovery, measurement control, data collection, and logging. It uses a third-party API (ppk2_api) with no evident malicious manipulations. The measurement thread runs continuously with a control flag, and data is stored locally in CSV files. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network communication beyond device API, or hidden malicious code. No suspicious or unexpected behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a power measurement interface and data logger without evident malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It performs legitimate hardware interfacing, measurement, and file I/O operations. No malicious intent or malware features are detected.",
