{
  "purpose": "The code provides an API for serial communication with the Nordic Semiconductor's Power Profiler Kit II (PPK2), handling device control, data acquisition, and metadata parsing.",
  "sources": "Serial port reads for data and metadata, configuration commands sent via serial write.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data into system effects; data is processed internally without external transmission.",
  "flows": "Serial data read flows into parsing functions; commands flow from API methods to serial port writes; data flows from serial input to measurement processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Serial data validation is minimal but typical for hardware APIs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard hardware interface for PPK2, utilizing serial communication, threading for background data fetching, and data processing routines. No malicious routines, backdoors, or network activity are present. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic. The minimal security risk stems from the hardware interaction nature, which is inherent and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API for hardware communication with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the risk score is appropriately low at 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent threat.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
