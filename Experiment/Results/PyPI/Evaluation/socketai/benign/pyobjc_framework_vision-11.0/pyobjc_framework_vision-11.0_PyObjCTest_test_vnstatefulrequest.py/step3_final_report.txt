  "purpose": "Unit test verifying method signatures and OS version compatibility for Vision.VNStatefulRequest.",
  "sources": "Import statements, method calls to assertArgIsBlock with method signatures and OS version checks.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only performs signature assertions without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward API signature validation tests.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test suite that checks method signatures for VNStatefulRequest's initialization methods, conditioned on OS version. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain any suspicious or malicious code. The purpose is solely to verify method signatures and compatibility, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The high confidence levels reflect certainty in the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard API validation test with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
