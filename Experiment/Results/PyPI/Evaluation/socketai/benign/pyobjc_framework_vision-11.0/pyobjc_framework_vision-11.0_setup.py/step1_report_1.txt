{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the pyobjc-framework-Vision package, providing wrappers for the Vision framework on macOS.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ to modify sys.path, reading the 'Modules' directory for dependencies, importing os and sys modules, importing setup and Extension from pyobjc_setup.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions with user input.",
  "flows": "sys.path modification and directory listing to determine dependencies, then passing static configuration data to setup and Extension functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. Use of standard setup and import patterns. No dynamic code execution, no network connections, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, importing modules, defining package metadata, and configuring extension modules. It dynamically includes source dependencies from the 'Modules' directory but only based on filenames. There is no processing of user input, network communication, or execution of untrusted code. The script follows typical packaging patterns without suspicious modifications or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities. The observed behavior is standard for package distribution.",
