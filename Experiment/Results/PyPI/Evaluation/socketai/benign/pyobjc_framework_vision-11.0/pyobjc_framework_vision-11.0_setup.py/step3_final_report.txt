{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python extension module that wraps the macOS Vision framework using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Filesystem directory 'Modules' for source files, os.listdir() for dependency listing, __file__ for current file path, and environment variables indirectly via dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or data sinks; no network or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Filesystem listing of 'Modules' directory feeds into extension dependencies; no data flows into or out of untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard setup script with clear structure and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: importing modules, adjusting sys.path, dynamically including source files from 'Modules', and configuring extension modules linking against system frameworks. It does not process user input, perform network activity, or execute untrusted code. The dependency list is based solely on local filesystem content. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package wrapping the macOS Vision framework. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
