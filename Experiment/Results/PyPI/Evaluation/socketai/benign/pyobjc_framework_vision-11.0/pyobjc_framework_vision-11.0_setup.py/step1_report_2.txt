{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python wrapper for the macOS Vision framework using pyobjc.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the filesystem (os.listdir), reads script's own directory (__file__), and external dependencies via import statements.",
  "targets": "No explicit untrusted data sinks; however, the script executes filesystem operations and package setup functions which could be misused if tampered with.",
  "flows": "Filesystem data (list of modules) used in package dependencies; no untrusted data flows to sensitive functions or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code strictly performs package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and sets up package configuration for pyobjc framework binding. It dynamically lists module files for dependencies, which is standard for setup scripts. There are no signs of code injection, network activity, or malicious logic. The code's purpose aligns with typical package setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate setup script for packaging a Python wrapper around the macOS Vision framework. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
