  "purpose": "The code defines setup instructions for building and installing the pyobjc-framework-Vision package, including configuration for extensions and dependencies.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), os.listdir('Modules'), __doc__",
  "sinks": "None; the code primarily performs setup tasks without handling untrusted data or performing sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The code appears to be standard package setup logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, manipulates the system path for package setup, and defines a setup configuration for a Python package wrapping a macOS framework. It constructs a list of dependencies and extension modules, using safe, standard practices. No external data inputs are processed in a way that could lead to security issues. The only notable operations are directory listing and string concatenation for configuration, which are safe. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard package configuration tasks without handling or executing untrusted data.",
