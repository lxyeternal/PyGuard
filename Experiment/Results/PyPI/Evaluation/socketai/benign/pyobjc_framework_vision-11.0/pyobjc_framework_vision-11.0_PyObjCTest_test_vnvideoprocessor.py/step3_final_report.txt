  "purpose": "Verify constants and method signatures of the VNVideoProcessor class within the Vision framework for OS version 11.0 and above.",
  "sources": "Static assertions on constants and method signatures; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code performs static API signature verification without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite verifying constants and method signatures of the VNVideoProcessor class. It uses decorators to specify OS version requirements and performs static assertions on method return types and argument configurations. No external data, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The code's purpose is API validation, which is inherently safe. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are consistent with the code's static, non-executable nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API validation test suite with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores are appropriate and require no adjustment.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
