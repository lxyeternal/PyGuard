  "purpose": "Unit tests for Vision framework's VNVideoProcessor class, verifying constants and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Import statements and method calls within the class testing framework.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process untrusted data or contain data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard test assertions and method signatures.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements and a test class with methods that verify the types and signatures of various methods in the Vision.VNVideoProcessor class. All assertions check for expected data types and method argument configurations, with no evidence of data leaks, code injection, or malicious logic. The code adheres to standard testing practices, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. No external or untrusted data sources or sinks are used.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test for verifying framework method signatures and constants, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
