  "purpose": "Build and test setup for PyObjC framework wrappers, involving environment detection, SDK info retrieval, and test execution.",
  "sources": "System commands (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), environment variables, package metadata files, sys.path modifications, file reads.",
  "sinks": "Writing build info files, modifying sys.path/modules, executing tests via unittest, loading plist files.",
  "flows": "System commands and environment variables influence build flags, SDK detection, and build info generation; data flows into build configuration and test execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows. Use of subprocess for environment info is standard in build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive build and test setup script relying on system commands, environment variables, and package metadata. All subprocess calls are for environment detection and configuration, typical for such scripts. No malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation is evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured build and test utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores accurately reflect its benign behavior and low security threat level.",
