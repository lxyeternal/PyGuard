  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the script gathers system info via subprocess, environment variables, and package metadata.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious activity; subprocess calls are standard for build info. Data flows are typical for build scripts.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials or backdoors; subprocess execution without input validation is noted but standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The script is a typical build setup, with no malicious intent. The high confidence (0.9) aligns with the assessment.\n\n**Risk & Malware Scores:**  \n- *Risk:* 0.2 — low, given the benign nature.  \n- *Malware:* 0 — no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing environment variables, subprocess info, and build configuration.  \n- No suspicious network activity or obfuscation.  \n- The detailed flow analysis supports the conclusion of benign behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *Risk:* 0.1 — very low.  \n- *Malware:* 0 — no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- Focuses on environment detection, SDK info, and build setup, all standard.  \n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- The subprocess calls are used solely for environment info.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *Risk:* 0.1 — low.  \n- *Malware:* 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- Highlights the reliance on subprocess for system info, environment variables, and build configuration.  \n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- The subprocess commands are typical for build scripts.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *Risk:* 0.1 — appropriate.  \n- *Malware:* 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar assessment: the script is a standard build utility, heavily reliant on system commands, with no signs of malicious intent.  \n- No network activity or backdoors.  \n- The code is standard for such build scripts.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *Risk:* 0.2 — reasonable.  \n- *Malware:* 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports consistently identify that the code is a complex but standard build and test setup script for a Python extension.  \n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident.  \n- The use of subprocess, environment variables, and file I/O is typical for such scripts.  \n- The risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature, and malware scores are zero.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- All reports agree on 0, which is correct; no obfuscation present.\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- All reports assign 0, which is justified given the analysis.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- Slight variation (0.1–0.2), which is reasonable given the reliance on system commands but no malicious intent.\n\n**My Personal Estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to system command execution, which is standard in build scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe provided scores are appropriate and align with the detailed analysis. The code is a legitimate build and test setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks evident.",
