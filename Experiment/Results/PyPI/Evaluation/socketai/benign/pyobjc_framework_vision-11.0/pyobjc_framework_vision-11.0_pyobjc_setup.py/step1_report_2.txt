{
  "purpose": "The script provides setup and build automation for the PyObjC framework, including compiling extensions, configuring environment, and running tests.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (e.g., CFLAGS, PATH), subprocess outputs (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), filesystem operations (os.path.exists, open), and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls that execute system commands (e.g., sw_vers, clang, xcrun), file operations (writing build info, reading SDK settings), modifying sys.path, and running tests via unittest.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → subprocess outputs → SDK detection → setup configuration → compilation flags → build extension → test execution.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive subprocess calls for system info, dynamic modification of sys.path, reading SDK settings directly, and environment-sensitive compiler configuration. No obvious hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive setup script for building and testing PyObjC, with numerous system calls to gather environment and SDK info. It dynamically adjusts compilation flags, manages environment and sys.path, and runs tests. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are evident. The subprocess calls are standard for build environments and do not appear malicious. The code reads system info and SDK versions but does not transmit data or access external networks maliciously. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or harmful system modifications are found. The code structure is complex but typical for setup scripts; no signs of malicious obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard build and test setup for PyObjC with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It gathers system info, configures build environment, and executes tests securely. The overall security risk is very low.",
