  "purpose": "Unit test for verifying constants in Vision framework's face landmarks detection request revisions.",
  "sources": "Importing modules 'PyObjCTools.TestSupport' and 'Vision'. Accessing constants 'VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequestRevision1' and 'VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequestRevision2'.",
  "sinks": "Assertions checking equality of constants, which do not process untrusted input or produce external output.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> Access constants -> Assert equality (no data flow involving untrusted input).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test verifying specific constant values within the Vision framework. It imports testing and Vision modules, then asserts that certain revision constants equal expected values. No user input, network communication, or file operations are involved. The code is well-structured, standard for testing constants, and lacks any suspicious or malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs simple, legitimate unit testing of predefined constants in the Vision framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is safe and appears to be standard testing code.",
