  "purpose": "The code defines a test case for Vision framework constants related to face landmark detection revisions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for PyObjCTools.TestSupport and Vision modules, which provide testing tools and Vision framework constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks, as the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any data transmission.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and asserts constant values; no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing support and vision modules, then defines a test case class with a single method that asserts specific constant values. It performs straightforward assertions to verify that constants match expected revision numbers. There are no dynamic executions, input handling, or data leaks. The code appears to be standard unit test code for framework constants, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple unit test verifying constant values in the Vision framework. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
