{
  "purpose": "The code tests constants related to Vision framework's face landmark detection requests.",
  "sources": "Imports from PyObjCTools.TestSupport and Vision modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; purely constant checks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing support and Vision framework modules, then defines a test case class that verifies two constant values. It does not read external input, write data, or execute dynamic code. The structure is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The purpose appears to be ensuring the correctness of framework constants.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign test case verifying constant values. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues.",
