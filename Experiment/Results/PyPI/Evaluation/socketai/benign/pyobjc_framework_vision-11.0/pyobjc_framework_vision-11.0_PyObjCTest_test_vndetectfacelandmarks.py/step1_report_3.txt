{
  "purpose": "The code is a test case verifying constants in the Vision framework related to face landmark detection.",
  "sources": "The code imports test support utilities and the Vision module; no input or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only checks constant values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and a system framework module, then defines a test case class that asserts specific constant values in the Vision framework. The code solely verifies framework constants and does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modification. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The imports are standard and used for testing purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test case verifying constant values in a framework module. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present. It appears to be a standard, safe unit test.",
