  "purpose": "Verify that specific constants related to Vision framework's face landmark detection revisions have expected values.",
  "sources": "Import statements for TestCase and Vision modules; constant definitions within the Vision module.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data transmission.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assertions without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard unit test with no suspicious or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple unit test importing testing support and the Vision framework, then asserting that two constants equal specific revision numbers. No dynamic code, data input, network operations, or system modifications are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature. Given the static, safe nature of the code, the malware score remains at 0, and no further action is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward unit test verifying constant values in the Vision framework. It poses no security risks, contains no malware or obfuscation, and is consistent with best practices for safe code. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
