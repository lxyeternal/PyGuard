  "purpose": "Unit tests verifying constants and method signatures of the Vision framework's VNClassifyImageRequest class.",
  "sources": "Constants (VNClassifyImageRequestRevision1, VNClassifyImageRequestRevision2), methods (knownClassificationsForRevision_error_, supportedIdentifiersAndReturnError_).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external input, or system modifications present.",
  "flows": "Assertions check method signatures and constants; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static test suite verifying API constants and method signatures. It uses standard testing patterns, OS version decorators, and assertions. No external data, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The code's purpose is static validation, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The consistent high confidence scores and zero malware/security risk align with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard API validation test suite with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
