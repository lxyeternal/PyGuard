  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Purpose & Sources**: The code is a set of test cases verifying constants, enums, and method signatures for Vision's human body pose detection.\n   - **Sinks & Flows**: No data is processed or transmitted; it's purely static assertions.\n   - **Anomalies**: No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.\n   - **Analysis & Conclusion**: The code is standard testing code, verifying API constants and method signatures. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 (correct)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n     - Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - Similar to Report 1, confirming API constants and method signatures with no data flow or suspicious activity.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Risk: 0\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - Again, a straightforward unit test for constants and method signatures.\n   - No data processing, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Risk: 0\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - Same pattern: static assertions on constants and method signatures.\n   - No evidence of malicious activity.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Risk: 0\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - Consistent with previous reports: API validation tests with no data flow or suspicious behavior.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Risk: 0\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports correctly indicate 0. The code is purely static test code with no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports correctly indicate 0. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score**: All reports correctly indicate 0, as there are no security risks, data leaks, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Overall Justification:**\n\n- The code is a standard, static test suite verifying constants, enums, and method signatures for the Vision framework.\n- There are no external inputs, no network operations, no data manipulation, and no code execution beyond assertions.\n- The purpose is to ensure API correctness, not to process or handle sensitive data.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and accurate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis code is benign and purely for API validation purposes.",
