{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the Vision framework's human body pose detection features, verifying constants and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Imports from PyObjCTools.TestSupport and Vision modules, as well as class methods that check constants and method argument types.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network communication, file writing, or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves calling assertion methods to verify constants and method signatures; no untrusted data input or output is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are observed. The code consists solely of standard test assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs static assertions on constants and method argument types related to Vision framework's human body pose detection. There are no sources of untrusted input, no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, and no suspicious code logic. The structure and format are typical of unit tests. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of unit tests verifying constants and method signatures for the Vision framework. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risk in this code fragment.",
