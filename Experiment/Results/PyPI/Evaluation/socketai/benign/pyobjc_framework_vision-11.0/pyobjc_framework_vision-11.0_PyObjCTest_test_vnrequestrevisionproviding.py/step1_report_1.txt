{
  "purpose": "This code defines a helper class for Vision framework testing, providing a request revision number and verifying method signatures and protocols.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that could lead to data leaks, remote connections, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present. The code appears to be standard testing scaffolding.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system modules, defines a simple helper class with a method returning a static integer, and performs method signature and protocol existence tests. All operations are standard for testing frameworks and do not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test helper for Vision framework, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
