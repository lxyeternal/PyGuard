{
  "purpose": "Define a helper class that provides a fixed request revision number for Vision framework testing and verify method signatures and protocol conformance.",
  "sources": "Method requestRevision() returning a static integer; imports of objc, TestSupport, and Vision modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external communication, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Test methods invoke requestRevision() and check protocol existence; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class and test definitions with no suspicious code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Objective-C bridging class with a method returning a static value, used in testing. It performs no dynamic or external operations, contains no obfuscation, and adheres to standard testing practices. The test methods verify method signatures and protocol existence without any malicious or risky behavior. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing framework compatibility, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
