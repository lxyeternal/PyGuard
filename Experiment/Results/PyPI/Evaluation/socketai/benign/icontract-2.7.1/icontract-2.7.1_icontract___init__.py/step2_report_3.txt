  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, potential issues, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward setup module that imports specific components from the 'icontract' library and assigns them to local variables for ease of use.\n- It contains no untrusted data processing, network operations, file manipulations, or dynamic code execution.\n- The comments clarify versioning and import mechanics but do not suggest malicious intent.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n- **Malware or Suspicious Behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** None, as the code only performs module imports and aliasing.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Scores and Justifications:\n\n**Malware Score:**\n\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n\n- All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n\n**Risk Score:**\n\n- All reports assign a risk score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- No logic or behavior in the code justifies a higher risk score.\n\n**Confidence:**\n\n- High confidence (1) is justified given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations and Recommendations:\n\n- **No issues with the current scores.** They are reasonable and justified.\n- **No need for adjustments** since the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- **No assumptions** about vulnerabilities are necessary; the code's purpose is clear.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard setup for a Python library, importing and aliasing components from 'icontract'. There are no security concerns, malicious behavior, or obfuscation present. The current scoring reflects this accurately.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are correct; no changes needed.",
