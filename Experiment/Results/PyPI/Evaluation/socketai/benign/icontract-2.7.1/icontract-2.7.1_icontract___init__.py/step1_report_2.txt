{
  "purpose": "This code imports and assigns various components from the icontract library for use in decorating functions with contracts and managing invariants, snapshots, and errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version, author, copyright, license, status, and various modules and attributes from the icontract library.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing specific modules and assigning imported components to local names for further use, with no data processing or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation are present. The code consists solely of import statements and variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports specific attributes and modules from the icontract package, assigning them to local variables for use elsewhere. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, or data processing that could pose security risks. The purpose is clearly to set up decorators and globals for contract enforcement, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, mainly setting up imports and aliases for the icontract library. It contains no malware, malicious code, or security risks. It is a standard setup file for contract decorators, with no suspicious or malicious intent.",
