  "purpose": "This code initializes and sets up references for the icontract library, providing decorators and globals for contract programming.",
  "sources": "The code reads version info, author info, and imports specific modules and attributes from the icontract package.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks or untrusted data handling points in this code.",
  "flows": "The code primarily assigns imported modules and attributes to local variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns. The code structure is straightforward and standard for library setup.",
  "analysis": "The script sets metadata, disables pylint warnings, and imports specific components from the icontract library, assigning them to local variables for use elsewhere. No user input, external data, or untrusted sources are involved. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code appears to be a typical library setup file with no suspicious or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup/init script for the icontract library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It merely assigns and re-exports parts of the library for convenience.",
