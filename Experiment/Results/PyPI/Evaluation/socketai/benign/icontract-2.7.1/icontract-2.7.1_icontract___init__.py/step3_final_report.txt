  "purpose": "Import and alias specific components from the 'icontract' library for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'icontract' modules, no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code performs static imports and variable assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup code with clear structure and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple setup script importing specific decorators and global variables from the 'icontract' library, assigning them to local variables for convenience. It contains no dynamic code execution, user input handling, network access, or file I/O. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are present. The comments explain versioning and import mechanics, indicating standard practice. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup module for the 'icontract' library, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports correctly assess the code as safe, and the scores are justified and consistent.",
