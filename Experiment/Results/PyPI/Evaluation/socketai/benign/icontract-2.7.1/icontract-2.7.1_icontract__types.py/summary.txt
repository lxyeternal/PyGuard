  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious part of a contract enforcement library. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score (approximately 0.05) and zero malware score are justified by its straightforward, introspection-based design. Overall, it is safe and suitable for use in supply chain contexts."
