{
  "purpose": "Define data structures and classes related to contract enforcement, snapshots, and invariant checks for use in a contract-based programming system.",
  "sources": "import statements, function signatures, attribute assignments, inspect.signature calls, enum definitions, class initializers.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No untrusted data processing or network communication points identified.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flow paths from sources to sinks identified; the code mainly defines data structures and does not process external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code consists of standard class definitions and usage of Python introspection modules.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several classes (`Contract`, `Snapshot`, `Invariant`, `InvariantCheckEvent`) for managing and enforcing contracts and invariants. It uses introspection (`inspect.signature`) to analyze function signatures, which is a standard practice for such systems. No evidence of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior. There are no network operations, system modifications, or obfuscated code segments. The structure and imports suggest a library focused on contract enforcement, not malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward implementation of a contract-based system for Python, primarily involving data structure definitions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a contract enforcement framework without any malicious behavior.",
