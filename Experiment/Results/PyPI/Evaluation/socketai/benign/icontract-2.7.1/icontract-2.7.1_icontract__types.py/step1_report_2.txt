{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for managing contracts, snapshots, and invariants in a contract enforcement framework.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (enum, inspect, reprlib, typing), icontract._globals module, and class constructors that accept user-defined functions and parameters.",
  "sinks": "None apparent. No direct network, file, or system calls. No handling of untrusted data or environment variables.",
  "flows": "The code establishes class attributes and stores user-provided functions and parameters; no data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code primarily sets up data structures and validation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and icontract module globals, then defines classes Contract, Snapshot, InvariantCheckEvent, and Invariant. These classes encapsulate user-defined conditions, snapshots of arguments, and invariant checks. The constructors parse function signatures, store user inputs, and perform validation. There are no network calls, file I/O, command executions, or other side effects. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of data structures used in a contract enforcement framework. It primarily manages user-defined conditions and snapshots with validation and descriptive attributes. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
