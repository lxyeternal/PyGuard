  "purpose": "Define data structures and classes for managing contracts, snapshots, and invariants within a contract enforcement framework.",
  "sources": "Inspection of function signatures, class attributes, and internal data structures; use of inspect.signature to analyze callable parameters.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, network communication, file I/O, or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Construction of Contract and Invariant objects involves introspection of condition callables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual control flow detected. Use of introspection is standard for such libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for managing contracts, snapshots, and invariants, relying on Python introspection and enums. It performs no external data handling, network activity, or system modifications. The use of inspect.signature and type hints aligns with typical internal library design. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is to facilitate runtime contract enforcement, and all signals point to a benign, well-structured implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious part of a contract enforcement library. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score (approximately 0.05) and zero malware score are justified by its straightforward, introspection-based design. Overall, it is safe and suitable for use in supply chain contexts.",
