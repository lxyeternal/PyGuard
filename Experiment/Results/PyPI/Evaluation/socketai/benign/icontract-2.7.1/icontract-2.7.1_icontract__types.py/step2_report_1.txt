  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code defines classes (`Contract`, `Snapshot`, `Invariant`, etc.) for managing contracts and invariants, using introspection and enums. No malicious activity, no external data processing, no network or file I/O, and no obfuscation.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, consistent with the benign nature)  \n- **Comment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is purely structural and introspective, typical for such libraries.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the use of standard libraries, introspection, and data structures for contract enforcement. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1  \n- **Comment:** Accurate; the code appears to be a standard implementation.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern—defining classes for contracts, snapshots, invariants, with no external data handling or network activity. Uses introspection and enums.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1  \n- **Comment:** Consistent with previous assessments.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, the code is a straightforward setup for contract enforcement, with no external or malicious activity. Uses standard Python features.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.05 (even lower, given the same benign characteristics)  \n- **Comment:** Valid conclusion.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, no malicious or suspicious patterns. The code is a typical data structure setup for contract enforcement.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n- **Comment:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is purely structural, introspective, and typical for a contract enforcement library.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any report. The code is straightforward and readable.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in all reports, reflecting minimal security concern—mainly due to the use of reflection and introspection, which are common in such libraries but could be misused if misconfigured. However, given the code's nature, the risk remains very low.\n\n### Overall Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No evidence of malicious code or payloads.  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, standard code with no obfuscation patterns.  \n- **Risk:** **0.05 to 0.1** — Very low; mainly the potential for misuse of introspection features, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, benign implementation of data structures for a contract enforcement framework, with no signs of security threats or malicious activity.",
