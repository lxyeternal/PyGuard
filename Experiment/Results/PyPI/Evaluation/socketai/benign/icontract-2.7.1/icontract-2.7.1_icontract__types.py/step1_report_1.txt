  "purpose": "Define data structures and classes for managing contracts, snapshots, and invariants within a contract enforcement library.",
  "sources": "import statements, class initializations, method signatures, and attribute definitions",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input directly; code primarily defines data structures and performs introspection",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code flow is limited to internal class logic and reflection-based attribute handling",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors observed. Usage of `inspect` for reflection is standard for such libraries. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for managing contract conditions, snapshots, and invariants, using Python introspection and enum.Flag for event management. It performs typical reflection to extract function signatures and arguments, which is common for contract enforcement tools. No network operations, data leaks, or malicious system manipulations are present. The code's logic is consistent with defining internal data structures and does not process untrusted data directly. The use of standard libraries and patterns indicates legitimate design without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate part of a contract enforcement library for Python, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily defines data classes and enums with introspection, without any suspicious activities or malicious payloads.",
