  "purpose": "Define data structures for managing contracts, snapshots, and invariants within a code contract enforcement framework.",
  "sources": "Standard library modules (enum, inspect, reprlib, typing), icontract._globals",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external communication",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; data structures are used internally for contract management",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed. Code relies on standard Python features and library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes classes for contract enforcement, snapshots, and invariants, primarily using Python's introspection capabilities and enums. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious code execution paths are present. It appears to be a standard implementation of a design pattern for contract programming, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior. All methods and data manipulations are straightforward and intended for internal state management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of data structures for a contract enforcement framework. There are no indicators of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this module. It appears safe and standard in its design.",
