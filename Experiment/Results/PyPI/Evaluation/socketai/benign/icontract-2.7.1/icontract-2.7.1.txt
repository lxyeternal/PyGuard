The low risk score (approximately 0.05) and zero malware score are justified by its straightforward, introspection-based design. Overall, it is safe and suitable for use in supply chain contexts."

      "conclusion": "The code is a transparent, standard implementation of runtime contract decorators for Python, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security threats. The use of traceback for debugging info is routine, and no external system interactions are present. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to executing user-supplied functions during contract checks, which is inherent to such libraries but not malicious."

      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility for static source inspection and error message generation in contract validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate; the low risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal concern due to source code introspection capabilities, which are standard and safe in this context."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is not malicious by design but carries a significant security risk if the AST inputs are untrusted or maliciously crafted. The use of exec() on generated AST code is a known vector for code injection. It should only be used in trusted environments with validated inputs. The high malware and risk scores are justified given the potential for exploitation, though the code itself is intended for internal analysis and does not contain malicious payloads."
