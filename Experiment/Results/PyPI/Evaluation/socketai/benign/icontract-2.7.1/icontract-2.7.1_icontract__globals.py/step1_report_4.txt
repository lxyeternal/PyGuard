  "purpose": "Define global variables and type variables for use across modules, configuring representation limits and environment-based flags.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get for ICONTRACT_SLOW, import statements for os, reprlib, and typing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or write to external sources.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences the SLOW flag, which may control contract execution but does not directly lead to malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation. The code mainly sets configuration parameters and type variables.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and sets configuration variables for reprlib to increase display limits. It reads an environment variable to determine if slow contracts should be enabled, based on __debug__ mode. The use of TypeVars for generics is standard. There are no indications of malicious code, data leaks, or backdoors. The code is straightforward, mainly configuration and type variable definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as configuration and type setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
