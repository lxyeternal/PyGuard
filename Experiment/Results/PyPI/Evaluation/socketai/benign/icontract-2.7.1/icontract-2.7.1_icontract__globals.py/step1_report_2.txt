  "purpose": "Define global variables and configurations for representation limits and environment-based flags used across modules.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get() for reading the 'ICONTRACT_SLOW' environment variable.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data is directly used or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'ICONTRACT_SLOW' influences the value of the SLOW variable, but this does not impact data flow security.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Usage of reprlib with increased limits is benign. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules os and reprlib. It sets up a reprlib.Repr() object with expanded display limits, which is safe and for logging or debugging purposes. The SLOW flag is determined by the '__debug__' flag and an environment variable, both standard practices. The use of TypeVar with generics is also standard. There are no code injection points, malicious data handling, or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script that defines global variables for representation and environment-based control flags. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
