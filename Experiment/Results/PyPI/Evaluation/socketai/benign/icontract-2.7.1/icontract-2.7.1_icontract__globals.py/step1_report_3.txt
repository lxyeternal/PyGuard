{
  "purpose": "Define global variables and type variables used across modules, including configuration for object representation and environment-based flags.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get() for reading environment variables, import statements for standard libraries (os, reprlib, typing).",
  "sinks": "os.environ.get() potentially exposes environment variable values, but in this context it's used only for configuration, not sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'ICONTRACT_SLOW' influences the SLOW flag; no other data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs present. The code sets configuration parameters for reprlib without any suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines global variables for object representation limits and a flag for slow contract checks. The environment variable is read to set a flag but only influences internal logic. No user input, no network activity, and no malicious code are present. The code appears to be a typical configuration setup with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not handle untrusted data beyond reading a configuration environment variable, which is used safely.",
