{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for inspecting, representing, and generating error messages for contract conditions, primarily used for runtime validation and error reporting in Python.",
  "sources": "Sources include input source code lines for decorator inspection, function arguments, function globals, closure cells, and source code text for lambdas and decorators.",
  "sinks": "Sinks include the text extraction from source code, storing representations in a dictionary, and potential logging or display of values. No explicit sinks for untrusted data or network communication are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source code inspection (lines, source files), through parsing and AST analysis, into variable lookups, then into representations and message generation, without any external communication or untrusted data effect.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, such as dynamic code execution, network operations, or hidden backdoors, is present. The code performs static source code analysis and data representation. It relies on external libraries (ast, inspect, asttokens, re) but does not misuse them maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The code analyzes source code to extract lambda functions, decorators, and source text for error reporting. It uses AST parsing, source code text manipulation, and variable lookups for detailed error messages. There are no indications of malicious intent; all operations are static and focused on introspection and data formatting. No data leakage, network activity, or system harm mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static analysis and representation utility intended for runtime error message enhancement in contract checking. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The functionality is consistent with safe introspection and string representation, with no suspicious behavior observed.",
