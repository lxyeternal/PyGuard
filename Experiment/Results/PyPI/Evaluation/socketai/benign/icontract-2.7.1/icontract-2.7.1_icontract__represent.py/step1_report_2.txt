{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to inspect, represent, and generate error messages for contract violations in Python code, particularly handling source code analysis and variable representations for informative error messages.",
  "sources": "Reads source code lines, function source via inspect, AST nodes, and variable lookups including global, closure, and passed arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses source code text extraction (`asttokens.get_text`), variable lookups, and representation functions (`reprlib.Repr`) to generate strings for error messages.",
  "flows": "Source code lines and function objects flow into source extraction and AST parsing; variable values are collected and processed through visitor classes to generate representations for error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code relies heavily on source code parsing and AST manipulation, but no malicious behavior is apparent. Use of `inspect` and source code introspection is standard for such debugging tools.",
  "analysis": "The code performs source code analysis, AST traversal, and source extraction to facilitate detailed error messages in contract checking. It includes functions to parse decorators, identify lambda conditions, collect variable contexts, and generate human-readable representations. No external network communication, file writing, or system modification functions are present. All data handling is internal and intended for debugging or error reporting purposes. The use of `inspect` and source code manipulation is consistent with debugging tools. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system damage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a source code inspection and error message generation tool for contract validation, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It strictly performs source analysis and representation, which are typical for debugging or error reporting modules. No suspicious or harmful behavior detected.",
