  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility for static source inspection and error message generation in contract validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate; the low risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal concern due to source code introspection capabilities, which are standard and safe in this context."
