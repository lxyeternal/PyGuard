  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for static source code analysis, AST traversal, and source extraction to generate detailed error messages for contract validation failures.",
  "sources": "Reads source lines via inspect, source extraction with inspect.getsource, and AST nodes during traversal.",
  "sinks": "Generates source code snippets, variable representations, and formatted error messages; no external data transmission or code execution.",
  "flows": "Source code files -> source extraction and AST parsing -> variable lookups and source text -> message generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns; standard use of introspection libraries; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis using standard Python libraries (inspect, ast, asttokens) to extract source snippets and variable states for debugging and error reporting. It does not execute untrusted code, modify files, or communicate externally. The functions are designed solely for introspection and message formatting, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1) are justified given the static, debugging-oriented purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility for static source inspection and error message generation in contract validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate; the low risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal concern due to source code introspection capabilities, which are standard and safe in this context.",
