{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for inspecting, representing, and generating error messages related to Python function conditions, especially for contract enforcement and lambda inspection.",
  "sources": "The code reads source code lines from files, inspects functions and lambdas via the 'inspect' module, accesses AST nodes, and retrieves text representations of code segments using 'asttokens'.",
  "sinks": "The code converts AST nodes and source code snippets into string representations and stores these in dictionaries; it also constructs detailed error messages based on function source code and variable values.",
  "flows": "Source code is retrieved via 'inspect.findsource' and 'asttokens', then parsed into AST, which is traversed by the Visitor class to extract representations, ultimately used to generate messages that include source snippets and variable states.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious logic. It relies on standard Python introspection, AST parsing, and string manipulation. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a well-structured utility for source inspection and message generation related to function conditions, primarily used for contract enforcement and debugging. It uses standard modules such as 'ast', 'inspect', and 'asttokens' for source analysis and AST traversal. All source reading and AST manipulations are typical for such tools. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network calls, code injection, or data theft, are evident. The code's purpose aligns with debugging and validation, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard source inspection utility aimed at extracting and representing code snippets and variable states for contract violation messages. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. Its complexity and source analysis focus on debugging and validation, with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
