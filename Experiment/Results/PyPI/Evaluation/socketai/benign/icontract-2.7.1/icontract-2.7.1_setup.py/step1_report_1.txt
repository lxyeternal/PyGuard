  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the icontract Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst for long_description, imports from setuptools, os, sys, and gathers package info for setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data flows to external systems or effects; all data is static or controlled",
  "flows": "Reads local files (README.rst) and constructs setup configuration; no untrusted data flow or external data manipulation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected; the code follows standard package setup conventions",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script. It reads a README file for description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and extras. No input or output beyond static configuration. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or credential handling. All dependencies are standard and version-controlled. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration file with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
