{
  "purpose": "This is a setup script for packaging and distributing the Python project 'icontract'.",
  "sources": "File reads the README.rst file for long description, and the setuptools setup function with package and dependency definitions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input data; all data is statically defined or read from a file at install time.",
  "flows": "The file reads the README file to set 'long_description' which is used in the setup metadata; no untrusted data flow from external sources into sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. No dynamic execution, network calls, or hidden backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and setuptools, reads a static README file for description, and calls setup() with metadata and dependencies. All operations are typical for a Python package setup script. No untrusted input handling, no network activity, and no malicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies.",
