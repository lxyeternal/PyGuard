  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging the icontract library, defining metadata, dependencies, and reading a README file.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.rst file; static package metadata and dependencies; no untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "None; static data only, no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "No dynamic or external data flows; static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, conventional setup script with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for Python packaging, importing only standard modules and setuptools, reading a local README file, and defining package metadata, dependencies, and extras. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network calls, or handle untrusted input. Dependencies are explicitly versioned, and no obfuscation or suspicious code is present. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis and all reports.",
