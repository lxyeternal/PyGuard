{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'icontract', including metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "File read operation for 'README.rst', static data in setup() such as package info, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; all data used are static strings, lists, or file contents read from the filesystem.",
  "flows": "The flow is primarily static data from file reading and hardcoded metadata used directly in the setup() call; no user input or untrusted data sources are processed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden code, or obfuscated parts detected. The code strictly handles package configuration and dependency specification with standard Python modules.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py for a Python package, importing 'os', 'sys', and 'setuptools'. It reads a README file for long description, then calls 'setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and other configuration options. No dynamic execution, network calls, or untrusted input handling is present. The dependencies are version-restricted and do not contain suspicious entries. The structure follows standard practices for package distribution. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It purely handles package metadata and dependency declarations for distribution purposes.",
