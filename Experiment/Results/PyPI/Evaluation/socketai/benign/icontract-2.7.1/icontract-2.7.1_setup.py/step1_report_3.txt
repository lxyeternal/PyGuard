{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the icontract Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file for long description; importing setuptools modules; defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no network or file output based on untrusted input; no code execution or data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Reading README file -> passing metadata to setup() -> no external data flow to untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The script is a standard setup.py file. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script used for packaging Python modules. It reads a local README file for the long description and then calls setup() with static metadata and dependencies. All dependencies are version-specified or environment-specific. No network activity, no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, and no suspicious code behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard setup configuration for a Python package. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. It is safe to use as part of a package distribution process.",
