{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'icontract' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'README.rst' for long_description; reads environment variables indirectly through setup parameters; fetches package dependencies from predefined lists.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data; no network connections, file modifications, or environment variable usages are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading 'README.rst' into 'long_description', and from hardcoded package metadata into the setup function; dependencies are specified but not dynamically fetched or executed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. The code primarily sets up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and setuptools, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. The dependencies are statically defined, and no malicious code or backdoors are evident. The overall structure adheres to common setup.py conventions without anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script for packaging. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and presents no security risks. It functions solely to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
