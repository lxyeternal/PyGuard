  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, benign setup.py script.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The code reads a local README file and defines package metadata, dependencies, and extras.\n- No untrusted data, external network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- All dependencies are version-controlled and do not contain suspicious entries.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues or anomalies are present in the code. The code functions as a typical setup.py for packaging.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, security risk:** All reports correctly assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk as 0.\n- **Data flow and sinks:** No untrusted data flows or sinks are identified; the code only reads static files and defines static data.\n\n### Scores:\n- The reports assign **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **securityRisk = 0** consistently.\n- The confidence scores are high (1.0), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the script.\n\n### Justification:\n- Since the code is a standard setup script with no suspicious behavior, the assigned scores are reasonable.\n- The detailed reasoning in each report aligns with the actual code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Note:** The scores are consistent across all reports and accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a typical, safe setup.py script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0. No changes needed.",
