  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious by design but carries a significant security risk if the AST inputs are untrusted or maliciously crafted. The use of exec() on generated AST code is a known vector for code injection. It should only be used in trusted environments with validated inputs. The high malware and risk scores are justified given the potential for exploitation, though the code itself is intended for internal analysis and does not contain malicious payloads."
