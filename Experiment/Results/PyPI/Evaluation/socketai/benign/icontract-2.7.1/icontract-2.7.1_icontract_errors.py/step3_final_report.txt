  "purpose": "Define a specific exception class for indicating contract violations.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code is a class definition with a docstring.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external interactions or data flows are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code contains only a class declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single class 'ViolationError' inheriting from 'AssertionError' with only a docstring. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. The class serves as a semantic exception for contract violations. All reports correctly identify the benign, standard nature of this code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, with high confidence (1.0). The code is a minimal, harmless exception class with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python exception class with no malicious or security issues. The existing reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
