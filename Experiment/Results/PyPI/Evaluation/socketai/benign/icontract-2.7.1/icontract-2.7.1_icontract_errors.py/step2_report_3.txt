  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward class definition of `ViolationError` inheriting from `AssertionError`. There are no data flows, input/output operations, or external interactions. The class contains only a docstring and a class declaration, with no executable logic.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. No errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The `confidence` scores are all 1, reflecting certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is a simple exception class with no external interactions, no data processing, and no suspicious constructs, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted. The reports' scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, as there is no indication of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they only describe the code as it is—a benign class definition.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \n- The code is a minimal, standard custom exception class used for indicating contract violations.  \n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate** after reviewing all reports:  \n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is harmless. No adjustments needed.",
