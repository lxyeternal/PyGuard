  "purpose": "Define custom error class for signaling violations of a contract.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code defines a class with no data input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class 'ViolationError' that inherits from AssertionError. It serves to indicate contract violations but does not perform any operations, data processing, or network communication. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activities are present. The code is simple and standard for custom exception definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard class definition for a custom exception with no malicious intent or security risks.",
