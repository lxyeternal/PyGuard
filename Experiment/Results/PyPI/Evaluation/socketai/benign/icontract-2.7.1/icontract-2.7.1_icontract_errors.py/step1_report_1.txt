  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs; straightforward class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class 'ViolationError' that inherits from 'AssertionError'. It contains only a docstring and a class declaration with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscated code. The class serves as a specific exception type for indicating contract violations and does not introduce any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, harmless class definition used for error handling. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
