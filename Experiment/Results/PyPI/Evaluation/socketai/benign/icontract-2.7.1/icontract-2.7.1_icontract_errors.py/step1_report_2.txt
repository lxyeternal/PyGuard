  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class ViolationError that inherits from AssertionError. There are no input/output operations, external data reads, or security-sensitive operations. The class serves as a specific exception indicator for contract violations. The code appears to be straightforward and standard for defining exceptions in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic, benign class definition for a custom exception. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
