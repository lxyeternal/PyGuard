  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the provided code and the described findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Accurate; the code manages contract decorators, attributes, and signature info.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: No suspicious sinks; flows are standard for contract checking.\n- **Anomalies**: No obfuscation or malicious code; standard reflection and exception handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: The report correctly identifies the code as a standard design-by-contract implementation supporting sync/async, invariants, and dynamic decoration. No malicious activity or sabotage evident.\n\n**Score Justification**: Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is low (0.2). The confidence is high (0.9). This aligns well with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correct; similar focus on runtime contract enforcement.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: No external or malicious sinks; errors are raised upon contract violations.\n- **Anomalies**: No obfuscation or hidden malicious code; extensive reflection and attribute management are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Accurately describes the code as a conventional runtime contract framework with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Score Justification**: Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is minimal (0.1). Confidence is perfect (1.0). This is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correct; focuses on the utility functions for managing contracts.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: No network or external sinks; errors are raised as exceptions.\n- **Anomalies**: No suspicious or obfuscated code; reflection and dynamic wrapping are typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Correctly interprets the code as a standard contract enforcement system, no malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification**: Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is low (0.1). Confidence is high (0.9). Fits the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Accurate; the code manages contract decorators and attributes.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: No external data leaks; exception raising upon violations.\n- **Anomalies**: No obfuscation or malicious code; reflection and dynamic decoration are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Properly identifies the code as a legitimate runtime contract framework, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Score Justification**: Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is low (0.2). Confidence is high (0.95). Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correct; describes the utility for adding and managing contract checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: No network or data exfiltration; errors are exception-based.\n- **Anomalies**: No obfuscation or malicious code; extensive reflection is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Appropriately characterizes the code as a legitimate contract enforcement library, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Score Justification**: Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is negligible (0). Confidence is high (0.9). Matches the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports correctly assign 0, indicating no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores**: Slightly varied but generally low, reflecting the nature of the code as a runtime contract enforcement library.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate\n\n- **Malware**: **0** — No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated**: **0** — Clear, standard reflection and decorator usage.\n- **Risk**: **0.1 to 0.2** — Low, mainly due to extensive reflection and dynamic attribute management, which are typical in such frameworks but could be misused if injected maliciously.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, transparent design-by-contract implementation with no malicious or sabotage intent. The low risk and malware scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation**: The overall assessment indicates the code is safe, legitimate, and well-structured for its purpose.",
