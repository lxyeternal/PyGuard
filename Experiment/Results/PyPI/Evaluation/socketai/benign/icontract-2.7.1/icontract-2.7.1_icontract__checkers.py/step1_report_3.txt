{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to add, find, and manage contract checkers for functions and class invariants, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous functions, mainly for runtime contract validation and invariant enforcement.",
  "sources": "Reads include function decorators, inspect.signature, function attributes (__preconditions__, __postconditions__, __postcondition_snapshots__, __invariants__), and context variable _IN_PROGRESS.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are error generation via ViolationError, raising exceptions, and invoking contract.error functions or constructing exceptions based on contract definitions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments through contract checks (preconditions, postconditions, invariants), with potential error creation or exception raising upon violations, including optional capturing of old state snapshots.",
  "anomalies": "The code extensively uses dynamic attribute setting, reflective inspection, and function wrapping, but all appear consistent with runtime contract enforcement. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration points are evident. The contextvars for recursion control are standard and do not pose security issues. The asynchronous handling is explicit and correctly managed. No obfuscation or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements runtime contract checking with functions to find existing checkers, add preconditions/postconditions/invariants, and wrap functions with contract validation logic supporting async/sync behavior. It manages recursion and in-progress checks via contextvars, preventing infinite loops. Exception handling is designed to generate informative error messages, and the use of attribute-based decorations suggests deliberate and transparent contract management. No suspicious code, external data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The code focuses solely on enforcing user-defined contracts and invariants, with no signs of malicious sabotage or covert operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of runtime contract enforcement, supporting precondition, postcondition, and invariant checks for functions and class methods, with proper handling of async functions and no detectable malicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured utility for contract management without any security risks or malicious intent.",
