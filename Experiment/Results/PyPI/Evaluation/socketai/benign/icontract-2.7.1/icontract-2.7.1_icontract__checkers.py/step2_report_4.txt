  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and adjusting the scores if necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as a design-by-contract framework supporting sync/async, invariants, snapshots, etc.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious sinks; data flows are typical for such a library.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies or malicious indicators. Uses standard Python reflection, exception handling, and decorators.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is a legitimate contract enforcement library with high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The security risk is minimal, given the code's nature.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, correctly identifies the code as a runtime contract enforcement framework.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious sinks; data flows into exception raising and condition checks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. Uses reflection and dynamic decoration as intended.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is a standard, safe implementation.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, correctly describes the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious sinks; exception raising is standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or obfuscated code. Reflection and dynamic decoration are typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately low malware and obfuscated scores; high confidence.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with prior reports; describes a runtime contract system.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or data exfiltration; exception raising is standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; extensive reflection and dynamic decoration are typical for such frameworks.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious activity; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a contract enforcement utility.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious sinks; exception raising and decorator attributes are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious behavior; no external communication.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate low malware and obfuscated scores; high confidence.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. The code is a standard runtime contract enforcement library, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports. The code is clear, uses reflection and decorators transparently.\n- **Risk Score:** Generally low, around 0.1–0.2, reflecting the potential for misuse if user-defined contracts are malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores given by the reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No evidence suggests the code is malicious, obfuscated, or dangerous.\n- The code's purpose is to enforce contracts, which is a common and legitimate pattern.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (mainly due to potential misuse, not inherent in the code)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed review, confirming the code's safety and legitimacy.",
