{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and decorators to enforce design-by-contract principles, including preconditions, postconditions, invariants, and snapshots, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous functions.",
  "sources": "Function signatures, default argument values, decorator attributes (__preconditions__, __postconditions__, __postcondition_snapshots__), context variables, and function attributes.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising on contract violations; no network, file, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function arguments and defaults into condition checks; violations trigger exceptions; decorators manage attributes and wrapping functions; async functions await conditions; sync functions call directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Reflection and dynamic attribute management are standard for such frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a comprehensive runtime contract system with decorators that wrap functions, managing preconditions, postconditions, invariants, and snapshots. It uses reflection (`inspect`) to analyze function signatures, defaults, and async/sync distinctions. Decorator attributes store contract info, and context variables prevent recursive checks. Error handling raises specific exceptions. The code supports class invariants, including decorating `__new__` and other methods. No signs of obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious activity are present. The design aligns with standard design-by-contract practices, with extensive use of reflection and dynamic attributes, which are typical in such frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured design-by-contract enforcement library with no malicious or sabotage intent. It employs standard Python features for runtime validation, with no signs of obfuscation, network activity, or data exfiltration. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero.",
