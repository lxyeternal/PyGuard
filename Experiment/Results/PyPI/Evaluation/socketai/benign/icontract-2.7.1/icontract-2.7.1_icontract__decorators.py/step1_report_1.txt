  "purpose": "Define decorators for preconditions, postconditions, invariants, and snapshots to enforce contracts on functions and classes.",
  "sources": "Reading input from function arguments, environment, and traceback for location info; using inspect and traceback modules.",
  "sinks": "Adding preconditions, postconditions, invariants, and snapshots to functions and classes via icontract._checkers functions; raising exceptions on contract violations.",
  "flows": "Decorators wrap functions and classes, add contracts via icontract._checkers, and potentially raise exceptions if conditions are violated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. Use of traceback for location info is standard for debugging; no obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a set of contract decorators (require, ensure, snapshot, invariant) to enforce runtime checks on functions and classes, utilizing icontract's internal checker registration. It uses standard Python modules for introspection and debugging, with no signs of malicious intent or code injection. The error handling and contract creation involve validation of error types and placement of location info, but these are routine. The invariant decorator explicitly disallows async conditions in invariants, consistent with intended use. The code focuses on adding runtime contract enforcement without executing external or unsafe code. There are no signs of data leakage, hidden network communication, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code defines runtime contract decorators with standard safety practices, no malicious behavior, no suspicious data leaks or external communication. It strictly enforces runtime checks for function and class invariants, preconditions, postconditions, and snapshots. Overall, the code appears safe and intended solely for contract enforcement.",
