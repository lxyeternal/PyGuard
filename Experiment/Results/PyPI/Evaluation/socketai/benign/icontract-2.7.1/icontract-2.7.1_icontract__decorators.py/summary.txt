  "conclusion": "The code is a transparent, standard implementation of runtime contract decorators for Python, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security threats. The use of traceback for debugging info is routine, and no external system interactions are present. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to executing user-supplied functions during contract checks, which is inherent to such libraries but not malicious."
