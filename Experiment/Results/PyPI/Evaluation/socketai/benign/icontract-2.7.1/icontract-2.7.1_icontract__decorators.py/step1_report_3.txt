{
  "purpose": "This code defines several class-based decorators for specifying preconditions, postconditions, invariants, and snapshots within Python functions and classes, used for contract programming.",
  "sources": "The code reads function arguments, function metadata (like filename, line number, function name), and class attributes. It also captures stack traces for location info.",
  "sinks": "The code potentially raises exceptions based on contract violations; it also allows custom error functions or exceptions to be raised upon contract failure. No data leaks or external data transmissions are directly observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (function arguments, capture functions) flows into contract checks and may trigger exceptions. Contract violations invoke error handling. Stack traces are used for location info during initialization.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or malicious anomalies. The code employs standard Python inspection, traceback, and type-checking. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or suspicious file manipulations are present. All exception handling and error raising are for contract enforcement.",
  "analysis": "The code employs well-structured class-based decorators for contract enforcement (require, ensure, snapshot, invariant). It validates inputs and error handlers, captures debug info via stack traces, and integrates with icontract._checkers for managing pre- and postconditions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious network activity, or backdoors are evident. The use of exceptions and assertion-based checks aligns with standard contract programming practices. No external data transmission, file system manipulation, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of a contract programming library with no malicious behavior. It focuses on enforcing code correctness via runtime checks, with no indications of malicious intent or security threats.",
