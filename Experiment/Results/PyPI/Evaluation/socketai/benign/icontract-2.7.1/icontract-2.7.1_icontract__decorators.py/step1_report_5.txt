{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of decorators for contract programming, including preconditions, postconditions, invariants, and snapshots for functions and classes.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function arguments, call stack for location info, and global variables for representation.",
  "sinks": "Adds contracts to functions and classes, which could influence control flow or raise exceptions; no explicit data leak points.",
  "flows": "Decorator initialization collects location info, then adds contracts to function checker stacks or class invariants. No external data flow or network interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code. The code relies on external modules like icontract._checkers but does not perform any unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a framework for runtime contract enforcement via decorators. It captures call stack info for debugging, but does not contain any network operations, file manipulations, or system commands. The handling of error types and assertions appears standard. There are no indications of data exfiltration, reverse shells, or unauthorized system access. The code is well-structured and uses typical Python features for such tooling, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of contract programming decorators for Python, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily adds runtime checks for function arguments and class invariants. No malicious behavior or sabotage is detected.",
