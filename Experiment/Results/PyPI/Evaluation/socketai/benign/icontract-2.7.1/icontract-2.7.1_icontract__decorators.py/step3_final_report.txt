{
  "purpose": "The code defines decorators for runtime contract enforcement, including preconditions, postconditions, invariants, and argument snapshots, to ensure function and class correctness during execution.",
  "sources": "The decorators read input data from function arguments, capture stack trace info for location, and utilize user-supplied callables for conditions, errors, and snapshots.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, user-supplied condition, error, or capture functions could raise exceptions or cause side effects during contract checks, but no external data flow or system interaction occurs.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are evaluated in user-defined callables; location info is gathered via traceback; exceptions are raised on contract violations; no external network or file operations are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present. The use of traceback for location info is standard for debugging purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard runtime contract decorators with validation of error types, use of traceback for debugging info, and interaction with internal icontract modules to attach constraints. No external communication, obfuscation, or malicious code is detected. The validation logic and exception handling follow best practices. The use of traceback for location info is routine and not suspicious. The decorators are designed for correctness enforcement, not malicious sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a transparent, standard implementation of runtime contract decorators for Python, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security threats. The use of traceback for debugging info is routine, and no external system interactions are present. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to executing user-supplied functions during contract checks, which is inherent to such libraries but not malicious.",
