  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's logic, potential security issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code implements decorators for preconditions (`require`), postconditions (`ensure`), invariants (`invariant`), and argument snapshots (`snapshot`).\n- It interacts with internal modules (`icontract._checkers`) to attach these contracts.\n- It uses standard Python modules (`inspect`, `traceback`) to gather debugging info like source location.\n- There are no signs of external network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious code injection.\n- Error handling and validation are routine, focusing on ensuring correct usage.\n- The code explicitly disallows async conditions in invariants, which is consistent with the intended design.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are evident.\n- The use of traceback for location info is typical for debugging and does not suggest malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Analysis per Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard contract decorators; source info from traceback.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Adds contracts via internal functions; no external data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 (low, due to potential misuse if user supplies malicious callables).  \n**Score adjustment:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar contract decorators; uses traceback for debugging.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Exception raising for violations; no external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; standard correctness enforcement.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.  \n**Score adjustment:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern; uses traceback for location info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Raises exceptions on violations; no external data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical contract enforcement; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.  \n**Score adjustment:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard contract decorators; uses traceback.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Adds contracts, raises exceptions, no external network or data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Well-structured, safe code for runtime checks.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 (slightly higher, but still very low).  \n**Score adjustment:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others; no suspicious sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Adds runtime checks, raises exceptions, no external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, safe implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.  \n**Score adjustment:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward implementation of runtime contract decorators.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low, primarily associated with the potential misuse of user-supplied callables for conditions or errors, which is typical in such libraries.\n- **Score Justification:** The scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are consistent with the code. The risk scores are very low, reflecting the low likelihood of security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal, related to potential misuse, but no active threats.\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, well-structured, and intended solely for runtime contract enforcement.**",
