  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'cobble' Python project, defining metadata and reading README for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file via open() function",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration points",
  "flows": "Reading README file, passing static metadata to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without context manager in read() function, but this is common in setup scripts and not suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script with static metadata, no dynamic or malicious behavior. It reads a local README file without user input or network activity. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The open() call lacks a context manager, which is a minor stylistic issue but not security-related. All signals indicate a benign, standard packaging script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
