  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'cobble' Python package, used to specify package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file via the read() function to include long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reading the README.rst file and passing data to setup(), with no external data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution. The read() function uses standard file reading with no input validation or external inputs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py used for packaging a Python module. It imports os and setuptools, defines a read() function to read a file (README.rst), and calls setup() with package metadata. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code follows conventional packaging practices without any anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
