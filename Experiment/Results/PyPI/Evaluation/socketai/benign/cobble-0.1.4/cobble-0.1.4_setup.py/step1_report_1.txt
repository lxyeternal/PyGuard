{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'cobble'.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file for long description; importing standard libraries; defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "N/A; no untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code follows standard Python packaging conventions without obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports os and setuptools for packaging purposes. It defines a read function to load a README file for the long_description parameter, then calls setup() with package metadata such as name, version, description, author info, URL, keywords, packages, Python version requirements, and classifiers. All elements are standard and intended for package distribution. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and conventional for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script for packaging a Python project, containing no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe and typical for open-source Python projects.",
