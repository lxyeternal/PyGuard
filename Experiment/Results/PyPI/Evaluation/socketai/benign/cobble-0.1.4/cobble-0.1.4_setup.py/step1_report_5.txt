  "sources": "Reading README.rst file for long description.",
  "targets": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Reading README file as part of package setup; no data flow to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. Use of standard setup.py practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks for a Python package: importing modules, defining a read function, and calling setup() with package metadata. The read function reads a local file for the long description. All operations are standard and do not involve external or untrusted inputs. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package configuration file with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
