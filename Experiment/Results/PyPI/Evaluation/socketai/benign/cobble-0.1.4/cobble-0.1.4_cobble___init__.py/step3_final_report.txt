  "purpose": "Utility for creating data classes with method generation and visitor pattern support.",
  "sources": "Class attributes accessed via getattr and dir; no external input involved.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically generated code via exec, which defines methods based on class attributes.",
  "flows": "Class attribute retrieval -> code string construction -> exec execution of code defining methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec with static code strings; no input validation or sanitization; reliance on class attribute introspection.",
  "analysis": "The code uses exec to generate class methods dynamically based on class attributes. The code strings are static and internally defined, reducing risk. No external inputs or untrusted data are processed. The primary concern is the potential for code injection if class definitions are manipulated or come from untrusted sources, but in this context, the code appears controlled. No malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of exec is a known pattern for metaprogramming but warrants caution in supply chain scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate metaprogramming utility with no malicious intent. The main security risk stems from the use of exec for dynamic code creation, which could be exploited if class definitions are compromised. Overall, the code is safe in a trusted environment, but caution is advised regarding the exec pattern.",
