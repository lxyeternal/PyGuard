  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate metaprogramming utility with no malicious intent. The main security risk stems from the use of exec for dynamic code creation, which could be exploited if class definitions are compromised. Overall, the code is safe in a trusted environment, but caution is advised regarding the exec pattern."
