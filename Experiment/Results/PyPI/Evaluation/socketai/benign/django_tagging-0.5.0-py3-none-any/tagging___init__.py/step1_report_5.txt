  "sources": "Assignment statements defining package metadata (__version__, __license__, __author__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; static metadata definitions only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static metadata does not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of straightforward variable assignments for package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata such as version, license, author, email, maintainer, and URL. It also specifies the default Django app configuration. There are no data inputs, outputs, or runtime logic that could be exploited. The code is purely static metadata, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This source code contains only static package metadata without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a standard part of a Python package's __init__.py or similar module, serving informational purposes only.",
