  "purpose": "Metadata and configuration information for the Django-tagging package",
  "sources": "Assignment of version, license, author, maintainer, and URL variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external calls or data processing occurs",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; purely static metadata assignments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward metadata declaration, no obfuscated or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static string assignments defining package metadata such as version, license, author, and URL. No input reading, data processing, or dynamic behavior is present. The structure and content are typical for Python package metadata files, with no suspicious code patterns or malicious constructs. There are no source-to-sink flows or anomalous behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only static metadata definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard package information file with no indication of malicious intent.",
