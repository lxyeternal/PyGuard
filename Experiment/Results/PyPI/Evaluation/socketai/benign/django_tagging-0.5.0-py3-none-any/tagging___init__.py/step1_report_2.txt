  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for the Django-tagging package, including version, license, author info, and project URL.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only module-level metadata assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output functions; no data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only assigns static string values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; straightforward metadata definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of module-level string assignments providing package metadata such as version, license, authorship, contact info, and project URL. There are no dynamic imports, external data reads, or code execution. No hardcoded secrets or potentially malicious behaviors are present. The metadata appears standard for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign metadata declaration for the Django-tagging package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
