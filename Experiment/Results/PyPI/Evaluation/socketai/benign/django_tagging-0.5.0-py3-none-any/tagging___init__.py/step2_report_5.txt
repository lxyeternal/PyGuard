  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static metadata assignments.\n   - The code only assigns string literals to module-level variables (__version__, __license__, __author__, etc.) and defines a Django app configuration.\n   - There are no dynamic behaviors, external data reads, code execution, or input handling.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Risks and Malware:**\n   - Since the code is only static metadata, the malware score should be zero.\n   - The reports consistently assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code content.\n   - No evidence suggests malicious intent or behavior.\n\n3. **Obfuscation:**\n   - All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Risk Scores:**\n   - All reports assign a security risk score of 0, which is correct.\n   - The reports' confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 1.0), which is justified given the simplicity and transparency of the code.\n\n5. **Any issues or anomalies?**\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code is standard for package metadata files, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Potential improvements or considerations:**\n   - Since the code is benign, no changes to the scores are necessary.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\nGiven the static, metadata-only nature of this code, I agree with the reports' assessments. No modifications are needed. The code poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is straightforward in its purpose.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis.",
