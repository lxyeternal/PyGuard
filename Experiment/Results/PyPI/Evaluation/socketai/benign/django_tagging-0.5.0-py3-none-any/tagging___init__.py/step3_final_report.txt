  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata and Django app configuration variables, serving as static information for the package.",
  "sources": "Module-level string assignments (__version__, __license__, __author__, __maintainer__, __url__, default_app_config)",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or external data sinks; the code does not process or output data dynamically.",
  "flows": "N/A - static assignments without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward static metadata with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments and a Django app configuration string, with no dynamic behavior, data processing, or external calls. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, metadata-only nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package metadata file with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
