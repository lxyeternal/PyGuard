  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward configuration utility.\n- The code only reads settings from Django's configuration with default fallbacks.\n- No untrusted data, external inputs, or network interactions are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The logic is simple, standard, and safe.\n\n**Confirming the code's correctness:**\n- The code does exactly what the reports describe: it retrieves optional configuration parameters with defaults.\n- There are no errors, flaws, or security issues in the logic.\n- The code aligns with best practices for configuration management in Django.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which seems appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating certainty.\n- The reasoning in each report is consistent and sound.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- No issues are identified, and the code appears benign.\n- The purpose is purely configuration access, with no data flows or external interactions.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified here.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score should remain at 0.\n- The confidence level is justified at 1, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a benign, standard configuration utility.\n- No modifications to scores or reasoning are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with all the provided reports and the code's actual behavior.",
