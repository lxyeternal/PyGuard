  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code's behavior, assessing the scores, and ensuring consistency.\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n\n- The code is a minimal utility that imports Django settings and retrieves two optional configuration parameters, providing default values if they are not set.\n- There are no data flows from untrusted sources, no external communications, no code execution based on user input, and no hardcoded secrets.\n- The code is straightforward, using standard Django practices, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n- Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malware, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1 to 5:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** All correctly identify that the code reads configuration values via `getattr` from Django's settings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** All correctly note that there are no data sinks or data flows leading to external systems or untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** All reports find no anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All conclude that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **confidence:** 1 (appropriate, given the straightforward nature)\n- **obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **securityRisk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- The scores seem appropriate and consistent across all reports.\n- The high confidence and malware scores are justified given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is correct; there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 is appropriate; no security risk or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Potential improvements:**\n- No changes needed; the reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a simple, benign configuration utility. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring aligns with the actual code behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action is necessary. The code is safe, and the reports are accurate.",
