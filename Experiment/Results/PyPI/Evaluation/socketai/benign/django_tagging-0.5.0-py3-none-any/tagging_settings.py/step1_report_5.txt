  "purpose": "This module provides access to custom tagging application settings with default fallbacks.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration values from django.conf.settings using getattr.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present, as the code only reads configuration values.",
  "flows": "The code reads configuration values (sources) from settings; no flow to sinks occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing settings and defining constants with default values using getattr. There are no untrusted inputs, no data flows to potentially dangerous sinks, and no suspicious code structures. The purpose appears to be configuration management. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is simple, with no obfuscation or unusual constructs. Given its role, it cannot be used maliciously on its own.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration access module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides default settings for a tagging system from Django settings.",
