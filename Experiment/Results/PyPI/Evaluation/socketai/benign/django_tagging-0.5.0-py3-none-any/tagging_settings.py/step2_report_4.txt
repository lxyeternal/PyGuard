  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a straightforward configuration utility for a Django application.\n- It uses `getattr` to retrieve optional settings with default values.\n- No untrusted input, external data sources, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- No network communication, file I/O, or other external interactions.\n- The purpose is to provide default configuration values for a tagging feature.\n\n**Malware and security risk assessment:**\n- All reports consistently conclude no malicious activity, with malware scores at 0.\n- The code is benign, with no signs of backdoors, malicious payloads, or obfuscation.\n- Security risks are reported as zero, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Score justifications:**\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The overall security risk score of 0 is justified given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or flaws:**\n- The code is minimal and does not perform validation or sanitization, but since it only reads configuration values, this is not a security concern.\n- No indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis code is a benign configuration utility with no security concerns.",
