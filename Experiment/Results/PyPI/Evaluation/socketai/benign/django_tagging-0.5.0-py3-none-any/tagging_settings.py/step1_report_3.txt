  "purpose": "Provide access to custom tagging application settings with default values.",
  "sources": "Read from Django settings module using getattr to retrieve configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling points present.",
  "flows": "Code reads configuration values from the settings module; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward retrieval of configuration values with defaults.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django settings and defines constants based on these settings with default fallback values. There is no user input, no data processing, no network communication, and no code execution based on external inputs. The logic is static and only involves retrieving configuration parameters, which are typically controlled by the application or administrator. No signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The purpose appears to be providing default configuration settings for a tagging feature, and the implementation is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration helper for application settings. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
