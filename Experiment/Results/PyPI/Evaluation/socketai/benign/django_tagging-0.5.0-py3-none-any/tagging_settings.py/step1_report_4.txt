  "purpose": "To provide a convenient interface for accessing custom tagging application settings with default values.",
  "sources": "Reading settings from django.conf.settings using getattr for 'MAX_TAG_LENGTH' and 'FORCE_LOWERCASE_TAGS'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows lead to potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only reads configuration values without executing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and uses standard Django patterns. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django settings and retrieves two configuration options with default values. It does not process untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or contain hardcoded secrets. The approach is typical for configuration modules and poses no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration utility with no malicious intent or security issues. It safely accesses application settings and provides defaults, with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
