  "purpose": "Provide access to custom tagging application settings with default values if not set in Django settings.",
  "sources": "Reading attributes 'MAX_TAG_LENGTH' and 'FORCE_LOWERCASE_TAGS' from Django settings module.",
  "kills": "No untrusted data input or external data sources are used; no network, file, or environment variable interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code simply retrieves configuration values.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward configuration access with default fallbacks. No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The module imports Django's settings and defines two constants based on settings attributes, with default values. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no other signs of malicious activity. The code is a typical configuration utility intended for setting defaults and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration helper for a Django application, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
