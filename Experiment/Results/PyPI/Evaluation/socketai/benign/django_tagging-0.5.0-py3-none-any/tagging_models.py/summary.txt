  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Django tagging implementation with controlled raw SQL usage. No malware, sabotage, or malicious activity is detected. The slight concern regarding raw SQL is mitigated by its controlled construction from model metadata. The overall security posture is low risk."
