{
  "purpose": "The code manages tags within a Django application, providing functionalities to add, update, retrieve, and analyze tags associated with models and objects.",
  "sources": "User input parsed via parse_tag_input; database queries via ORM filters and raw SQL; model metadata for table names.",
  "sinks": "Database operations (ORM and raw SQL execution); no external network activity detected.",
  "flows": "User input flows through parsing functions into database queries; raw SQL queries use parameters or model-derived identifiers to prevent injection.",
  "anomalies": "Use of raw SQL with string interpolation for table names, but these are derived from Django models, not user input; no obfuscation or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code employs parameterized raw SQL queries, mitigating injection risks. Table names are obtained from Django model metadata, which are not influenced by user input. No signs of malicious behavior, external communication, or obfuscation. The functions perform standard tagging operations with appropriate use of Django ORM and raw SQL where necessary. The overall structure and logic are consistent with secure Django practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Django tagging implementation with controlled raw SQL usage. No malware, sabotage, or malicious activity is detected. The slight concern regarding raw SQL is mitigated by its controlled construction from model metadata. The overall security posture is low risk.",
