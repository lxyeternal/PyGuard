  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard Django app configuration with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with basic metadata, including application name, label, and verbose name with translation support. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no insecure practices observed. The code appears to serve as a standard configuration module without any malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward Django application configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
