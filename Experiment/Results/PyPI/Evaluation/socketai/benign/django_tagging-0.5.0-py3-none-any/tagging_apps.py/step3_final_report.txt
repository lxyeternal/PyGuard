  "purpose": "Define application configuration for the 'tagging' Django app with translation support.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django AppConfig and gettext_lazy; static class attributes for app metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "None; static configuration without data flow or dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward Django app configuration with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Django AppConfig subclass that sets application metadata with translation support. It imports only standard Django modules and defines static attributes. There are no data inputs, outputs, external communications, or dynamic code execution. The code adheres to typical Django practices and does not contain any signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The absence of data flows, external interactions, or sensitive information indicates a benign and static configuration module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Django application configuration with no malicious intent or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting its harmless nature.",
