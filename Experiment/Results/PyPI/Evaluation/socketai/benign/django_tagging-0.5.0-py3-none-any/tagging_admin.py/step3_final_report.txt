  "purpose": "Registering Tag and TaggedItem models with Django admin, using a custom form for Tag.",
  "sources": "Importing models and forms, then registering models with admin.site.register.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are processed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; registration is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django admin, models, and a custom form, then registers models with the admin site. No dynamic code execution, external network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The custom form is imported but not shown; assuming benign. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident. The code is typical for Django admin setup, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django admin registration snippet for tagging models, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
