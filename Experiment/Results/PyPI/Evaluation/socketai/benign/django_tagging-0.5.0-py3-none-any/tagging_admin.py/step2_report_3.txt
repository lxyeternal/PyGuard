  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward Django admin registration of models, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- The code is minimal, importing Django admin, custom form, and models, then registering models with the admin site.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- The custom form `TagAdminForm` is imported but not shown; assuming standard or benign usage.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  The code does not contain any security issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious logic. The report correctly identifies that it is a standard Django admin setup.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws are evident.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond standard admin registration.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present, scores should remain at 0.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The only possible concern could be in the custom form `TagAdminForm`, but since it is imported and not shown, and the reports assume standard or benign usage, there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard Django admin registration snippet with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify this.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is safe and typical for Django admin configuration.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.",
