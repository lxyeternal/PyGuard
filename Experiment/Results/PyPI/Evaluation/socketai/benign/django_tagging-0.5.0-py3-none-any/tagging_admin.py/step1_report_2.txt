  "sources": "Import statements for Django admin, custom form (TagAdminForm), and models (Tag, TaggedItem).",
  "sinks": "Registration of models with Django admin; no data processing or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Models are registered with Django admin, no data flow from untrusted sources or user input outside standard Django admin operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Usage of Django admin registration is standard. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code simply registers models with the Django admin interface, assigning a custom form to the Tag model. It imports necessary modules and performs standard registration steps. No external data handling, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious behaviors observed. The custom form 'TagAdminForm' is imported but not shown; assuming standard or benign usage. No indications of malicious intent or security issues in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward Django admin registration setup with no malicious behavior detected. It appears to be a standard configuration for managing tagging models in an admin interface.",
