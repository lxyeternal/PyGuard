  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing, formatting, and managing tags within a Django application, including tag cloud calculations.",
  "sources": "User input strings, database querysets, and tag model attributes.",
  "sinks": "Database queries for tags, string outputs for user editing, and tag attribute modifications.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed into tags; database lookups retrieve tags; tag counts influence font size calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; parsing handles quotes and delimiters safely.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard string parsing with quote handling, safe ORM queries, and mathematical calculations for tag cloud sizing. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. The functions are well-structured, with appropriate error handling and input sanitization. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) align with the code's benign nature and minimal security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility module for tag management with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
