  "purpose": "Django ListView for displaying objects tagged with a specific tag, with optional related tags.",
  "sources": "URL kwargs 'tag' parameter, get_tag() utility function, database queries via TaggedItem and Tag models.",
  "sinks": "Database lookup via get_tag(), ORM filtering, context data assignment.",
  "flows": "URL 'tag' parameter -> get_tag() -> Tag object -> ORM query in get_queryset() -> context data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected. Reliance on get_tag() correctness assumed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django class-based view that safely retrieves a 'tag' parameter, converts it into a Tag object via get_tag(), and filters TaggedItem objects accordingly. Exception handling for missing parameters or tags is appropriate. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or external network activity. Utility functions are assumed secure. The data flow is straightforward, with no injection or backdoors. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation for displaying tagged objects in Django. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The low security risk scores are justified. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, and no modifications are necessary.",
