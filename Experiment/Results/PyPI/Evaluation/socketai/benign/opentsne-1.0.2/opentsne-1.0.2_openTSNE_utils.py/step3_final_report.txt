  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for timing, deprecation warnings, package checks, and geometric point clipping.",
  "sources": "Warnings module, importlib, numpy, time module, function parameters, input data in clip_point_to_disc",
  "sinks": "Warnings warnings.warn, importlib.import_module, numpy array manipulations",
  "flows": "Parameter check triggers warning; importlib checks package presence; clip_point_to_disc manipulates numpy arrays",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward implementation; no obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries for utility purposes. No network, file, or sensitive data handling. Warnings are used appropriately for deprecation notices. Package check via importlib is safe. Geometric clipping uses numpy safely. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors detected. The code is clear, well-structured, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate safe, standard practices. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be set to 0 given the absence of any suspicious activity.",
