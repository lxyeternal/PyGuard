{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for timing, deprecation warnings, package installation checks, and point clipping within a radius.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters, imported modules, and data passed to functions like 'points' in 'clip_point_to_disc'.",
  "sinks": "Data flow does not lead to any sensitive data leaks, system modification, or external communication.",
  "flows": "Inputs such as 'points', 'radius', 'inplace' flow through 'clip_point_to_disc' to produce modified points and masks; warnings flow from 'deprecate_parameter' to the user.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. Usage of standard library functions and numpy is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code contains utility functions for timing execution ('Timer'), warning about deprecated parameters ('deprecate_parameter'), checking for package installation ('is_package_installed'), and clipping 2D points within a circle ('clip_point_to_disc'). All functions utilize standard, safe operations. No data is sent over the network, no backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code does not include any suspicious or unusual patterns; it appears to serve legitimate purposes with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility code with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard operations related to timing, warnings, package checks, and geometric clipping without any suspicious or malicious logic.",
