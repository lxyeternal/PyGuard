{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and classes for timing, deprecation warnings, package installation checking, and point clipping within a radius.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function arguments (e.g., points array, parameter dictionary, libname string).",
  "sinks": "Data flows into numpy functions, warnings module, importlib, and package modules. No sinks process untrusted external input directly from outside sources.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are checked or used internally; no external data flows or network communications are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Usage of warnings and numpy appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes and functions: Timer for profiling, deprecate_parameter for warning about deprecated args, is_package_installed for module presence, and clip_point_to_disc for geometric computation. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage mechanisms. All functions operate on internal data or standard library functions without any suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module with no malicious intent. It performs standard operations like timing, deprecation warnings, package checking, and point clipping without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
