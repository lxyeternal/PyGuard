{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for timing, deprecation warnings, package installation checks, and geometric clipping of points to a disc.",
  "sources": "import statements, function parameters, class attributes, warnings, importlib.import_module",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn, importlib.import_module, numpy functions (np.linalg.norm, np.clip, np.arctan2, np.sin, np.cos)",
  "flows": "Parameter inputs (e.g., 'parameter' in deprecate_parameter, 'libname' in is_package_installed, 'points', 'radius' in clip_point_to_disc) -> triggers warnings or package import attempts or numerical operations",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic. Usage of warnings and dynamic import appears standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions and classes for timing, deprecation warnings, checking package installation, and clipping points within a circle. No user input is processed directly, and data handling is limited to standard warnings and numerical computations with numpy. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. Functions perform common tasks with safe practices; there are no suspicious data flows or backdoors. Usage of warnings.warn is standard for deprecation, and importlib is used for package checking. The numpy operations are straightforward mathematical calculations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module with no malicious intent. It performs timing, deprecation warnings, package checks, and geometric clipping safely. No indicators of malware or security risks are present.",
