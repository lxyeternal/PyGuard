  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Utility functions/classes for timing, deprecation warnings, package checks, and geometric clipping. No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score seems appropriate given the benign nature. The malware score is zero, and no obfuscation is present.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard utility functions with safe practices. No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** The security risk is even lower here, consistent with benign utility code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard functions, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Utility functions, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score but still consistent with benign utility code. The confidence is high, and no malware is indicated.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard utility functions, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate zero malware, which aligns with the code's benign utility nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports show zero obfuscation, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low across all reports, mostly zero or near-zero, which is appropriate given the benign functions.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The code is straightforward, with no network activity, no data exfiltration, no backdoors, and no obfuscation.\n- The functions are standard, well-documented, and do not perform any harmful operations.\n- The only minor concern could be the use of warnings.warn and dynamic importlib checks, but these are common in utility code and not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (slightly above zero, reflecting minimal inherent risk but still benign)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign utility module with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores should reflect this understanding, with zero malware and obfuscation, and a very low security risk score.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese are aligned with the evidence and analysis.",
