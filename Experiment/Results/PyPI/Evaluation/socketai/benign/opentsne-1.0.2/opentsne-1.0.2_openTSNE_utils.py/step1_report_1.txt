{
  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for timing, deprecation warnings, package installation checks, and geometric calculations.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters, user warnings, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak or effect may occur in the warnings and in the clip_point_to_disc function when manipulating numpy arrays.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (points, radius, inplace) to processing within functions; warnings are issued based on parameter checks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code segments detected. No obfuscation or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes and functions: Timer for measuring execution time, a decorator for deprecating parameters with warnings, a package presence check via importlib, and a geometric function to clip points to a disc. All code appears standard, with proper use of warnings and numpy operations. No indication of malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or backdoors. Functions operate purely on provided inputs without any network activity, file manipulation, or sensitive data access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no signs of malicious behavior. It performs standard timing, deprecation warning, package check, and geometric computations without any harmful actions.",
