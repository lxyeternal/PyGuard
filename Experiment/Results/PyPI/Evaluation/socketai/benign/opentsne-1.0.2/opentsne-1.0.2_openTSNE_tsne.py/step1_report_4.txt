{
  "purpose": "The source code implements t-SNE algorithms and related utilities for embedding high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional spaces, with support for optimization, partial embeddings, and interpolation grids.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from parameters such as X, affinity matrices (P), and random_state inputs. It also reads configuration parameters, callbacks, and affinity objects for initializing or transforming data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit data sinks that send untrusted data over the network, write to files, or perform similar actions. It uses logging, which is a controlled side effect.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables (X, affinities, initialization) through various functions and methods to generate embeddings, compute gradients, and perform optimization steps. Callbacks can influence control flow but do not modify external data stores.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are present. The code relies on well-known libraries like numpy, scikit-learn, and openTSNE, with no suspicious dynamic code execution or hiding mechanisms. The functions and classes perform standard data embedding and optimization tasks. No signs of data exfiltration, system disruption, or stealth malicious code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a set of standard and well-structured functions for high-dimensional data embedding via t-SNE, including mechanisms for partial embedding, interpolation, and gradient optimization. It uses multiprocessing and logging responsibly, without any indications of malicious data access or transfer. The negative gradient calculations, gradient clipping, and callback mechanisms are standard for numerical optimization and do not contain hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, network communication, or system modifications are present. The code appears to serve its purpose of data embedding without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate implementation of t-SNE algorithms, focusing on data embedding, optimization, and support utilities. There are no signs of malicious or sabotage code. It is a well-structured numerical library component, with no indications of backdoors, data theft, or other malicious behaviors.",
