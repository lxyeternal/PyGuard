  "purpose": "Importing classes and variables from local modules for t-SNE computations and version information",
  "sources": "Local module imports (.tsne and .version)",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data handling or external data transmission observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple import statements only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific classes and a version string from local modules. There are no external network calls, data processing, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be standard import statements to structure a larger project related to t-SNE algorithms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward import statements without any malicious intent or security issues. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
