  "purpose": "Importing classes and variables related to t-SNE algorithms and package version information",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.tsne and .version)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flows; this is purely import statements",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing specific classes and a version string from local modules. There are no dynamic code executions, data handling, or external communications. The imports appear standard for a Python package organizing its modules. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import of package components and version info, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
