  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from internal modules (.tsne and .version).\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, network activity, or untrusted data handling is mentioned.\n- The code appears to be part of a standard Python package structure, likely for machine learning or visualization.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected in any report.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), and all indicate no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The original code matches the reported snippets; no discrepancies or issues are present.\n   - The code is minimal and straightforward, performing only internal imports.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign import statements.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - All scores are 0, indicating no risk.\n   - Given the code's nature, this is justified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No malicious activity is described or implied.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's static import statements.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the evidence, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a standard, safe import statement block with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
