{
  "purpose": "This code imports classes and variables from internal modules related to t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) and version information, likely as part of a data visualization or dimensionality reduction package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: '.tsne' and '.version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or external effects are evident in these import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling observed in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code strictly performs module imports without any dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements, which are standard in Python packages to include internal modules and version info. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. The structure and syntax are straightforward and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical import statement block for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
