  "purpose": "Importing specific classes and variables from local modules for use within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.tsne and .version).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; these are static imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple import statements from internal modules, which is typical for a Python package setup. No dynamic code execution, no data processing, and no external input handling are present. The imports do not exhibit obfuscation or malicious behavior. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard for a Python package's internal module imports. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, supply chain attack, or security risk. It appears to be a benign component of a larger package.",
