{
  "purpose": "The code performs internal module imports to include classes and version information within the package.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules (.tsne and .version).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static imports do not process external input or data.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from external sources to sinks; purely static import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements importing classes and version info from internal modules. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling occurs. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning high confidence scores (1) and zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these assessments. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present, and the code aligns with standard Python package practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module import block with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
