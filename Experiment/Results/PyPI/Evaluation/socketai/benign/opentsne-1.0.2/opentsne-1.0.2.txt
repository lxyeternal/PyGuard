The only minor concern is the use of exec() for versioning, which is common but should be monitored if version.py is compromised. The overall security posture is very low risk."

The minor scores assigned in previous reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate, but given the benign nature, setting the securityRisk to 0.0 would be more accurate. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
