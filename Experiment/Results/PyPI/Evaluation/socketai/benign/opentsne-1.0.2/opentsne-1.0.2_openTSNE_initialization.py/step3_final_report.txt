  "purpose": "Provides functions for initializing embeddings in dimensionality reduction tasks, including PCA, spectral, random, weighted mean, and median initializations.",
  "sources": "Input data matrices, adjacency matrices, neighbor indices, distances, and random seed values.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission or network communication; computations are local.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input matrices through mathematical transformations to produce initial embeddings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, sklearn, openTSNE) for numerical operations. Functions perform typical initialization routines with optional jittering for numerical stability. No external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are present. Randomness is managed via check_random_state, ensuring reproducibility. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with common practices in embedding initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of embedding initialization functions with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. All signals indicate benign, well-understood numerical procedures.",
