  "purpose": "The code provides various initialization methods for embedding algorithms, including PCA, spectral embedding, random initialization, and weighted/median methods based on neighbor relationships.",
  "sources": "Data inputs from arguments such as data matrices (X), adjacency matrices (A), neighbor indices (neighbors), and distances (distances). Random state inputs for reproducibility. These are standard input points for embedding procedures.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or points where untrusted data leads to data leakage or malicious effects. No network, file, or system command interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (X, A, neighbors, distances) flow through mathematical computations for embedding initialization, involving PCA, spectral decomposition, and neighbor-based averaging. Random states influence stochastic processes but do not lead to external data or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious modifications. Use of standard libraries and functions for mathematical and statistical operations. No code injection, data exfiltration, or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs embedding initialization using well-known mathematical methods like PCA, spectral decomposition, and random sampling. It includes jittering and rescaling to improve numerical stability. The functions rely on external libraries (numpy, scipy, sklearn, openTSNE) for standard computations. Random seed control ensures reproducibility without external communication. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of embedding initialization techniques with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses typical library functions and follows expected patterns for numerical computation. No security risks or malware identified.",
