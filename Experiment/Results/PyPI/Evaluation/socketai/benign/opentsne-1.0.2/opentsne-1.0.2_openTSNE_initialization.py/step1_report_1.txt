  "purpose": "The code provides various methods for initializing embeddings in t-SNE algorithms, including PCA, spectral, random, and weighted mean-based methods.",
  "sources": "Reads input data matrices, adjacency matrices, random seed or state, and neighbor indices and distances.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified that could leak data or perform harmful actions; no network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into PCA, spectral, random, and weighted mean initialization functions. Eigenvalues/vectors are computed and transformed; neighbor data is used for weighted mean and median calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. Usage of standard libraries and functions appears legitimate. No obfuscated code or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard statistical and numerical methods for embedding initialization, including PCA, spectral embedding, random Gaussian sampling, and neighbor-based averaging. It uses open-source libraries like numpy, scipy, sklearn, and openTSNE without any suspicious or malicious patterns. No data exfiltration, network operations, or hidden backdoors are present. The functions seem to serve the purpose of initializing embeddings for t-SNE or similar algorithms, with optional jitter to prevent numerical issues. No anomalies or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of embedding initialization techniques used in dimensionality reduction algorithms. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It is safe for use.",
