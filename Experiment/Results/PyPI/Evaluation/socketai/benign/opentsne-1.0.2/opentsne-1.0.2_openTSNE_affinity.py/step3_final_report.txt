{
  "purpose": "The code implements classes and functions to compute affinity matrices for t-SNE, including neighbor search, affinity calculation, and handling new data points, using various methods such as Gaussian, multiscale, fixed sigma, and uniform kernels.",
  "sources": "Reads input data for neighbor search and affinity calculations; utilizes external libraries (numpy, scipy, openTSNE, scikit-learn compatible neighbor search modules).",
  "sinks": "Performs local computations; no external data transmission, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through neighbor search and affinity calculations; affinity matrices are computed locally; no external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard for scientific affinity computations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard affinity matrix calculations for t-SNE, with appropriate parameter validation, warnings, and error handling. It relies on well-known scientific libraries and does not include any malicious or obfuscated patterns. No network operations or external data leaks are present. The purpose is purely computational, focusing on neighbor search and affinity matrix construction. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and lack of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation for affinity matrix computation in t-SNE, with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. The supply chain security risk is negligible, and the low scores are justified.",
