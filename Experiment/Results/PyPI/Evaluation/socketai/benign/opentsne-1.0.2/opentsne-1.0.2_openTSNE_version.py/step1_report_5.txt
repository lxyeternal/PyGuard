  "anomalies": "Minimal; only version string assignment, no other code or data flow.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a version string to a variable named __version__, which is a common practice in Python packages to specify the version. There are no data inputs, no code execution, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, and no malicious constructs present. Since the code is minimal and standard, it does not pose any security risk or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version assignment with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is a standard practice in Python packaging and appears safe.",
