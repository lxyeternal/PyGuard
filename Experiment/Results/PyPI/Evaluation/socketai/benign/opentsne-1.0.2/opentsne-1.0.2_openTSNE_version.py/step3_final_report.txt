  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string assignment; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packaging. No input/output, external calls, or malicious patterns are detected. The code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the analysis. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and standard nature confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate and require no modification.",
