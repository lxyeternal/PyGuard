  "purpose": "This code provides callback classes for verifying exaggeration corrections and error approximations during a t-SNE optimization process, specifically for analyzing and logging the accuracy of affinity matrix approximations.",
  "sources": "Reading affinity matrix data (self.embedding.affinities.P), accessing parameters from gradient descent, and input embedding data (embedding).",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs (warnings, info, print statements), raising RuntimeError on mismatch of correction, and copying data from matrices.",
  "flows": "The code reads affinity data and parameters, performs calculations via imported functions, and logs or raises errors based on these calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code uses standard data processing and logging mechanisms. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines callback classes for verification and error analysis during t-SNE optimization. It performs matrix copying, parameter extraction, and uses functions from openTSNE and scipy to compute divergences. It logs warnings if conditions seem suspicious but these are related to expected data states. The use of partial functions for KL divergence approximations is standard. No network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are evident. The overall structure is typical for scientific computation and debugging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation for debugging and verification of t-SNE affinity matrix approximations. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It performs data analysis and logging without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
