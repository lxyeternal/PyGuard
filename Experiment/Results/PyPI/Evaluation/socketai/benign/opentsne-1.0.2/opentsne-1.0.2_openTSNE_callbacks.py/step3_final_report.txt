{
  "purpose": "The code provides callback classes for verifying exaggeration errors and error approximations during t-SNE, mainly for debugging and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Uses internal data structures such as affinities.P, parameters, and imported modules; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, error raising, and internal data copying; no data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "flows": "Internal computations involving affinity matrices, divergence calculations, and validation checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard scientific validation code for t-SNE debugging, involving internal data processing, logging, and error verification. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for debugging and validation within a scientific context. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security threats.",
