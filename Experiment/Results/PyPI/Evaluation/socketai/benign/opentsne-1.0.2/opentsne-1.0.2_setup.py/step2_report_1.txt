  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a setup script for openTSNE, with dynamic version execution via `exec()`, Cython extension compilation, and notebook conversion.\n- **Key points:** \n  - Use of `exec()` on `version.py` could be risky if `version.py` is compromised.\n  - No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or network activity.\n  - The notebook conversion uses nbconvert, which is standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — minor concern due to `exec()` but common in setup scripts.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Legitimate build script, typical practices, no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar setup script with standard build routines, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Key points:**\n  - No dynamic code execution beyond reading files.\n  - No network or data exfiltration.\n  - Uses standard libraries and procedures.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Safe, standard setup code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Setup script with environment-dependent build flags, dependency checks, and extension compilation.\n- **Key points:**\n  - Checks for system libraries (fftw3, omp) via temporary compilation.\n  - Uses environment variables for build customization.\n  - No suspicious code or network activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — typical build configuration, no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Standard, secure build script.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard package setup with extension compilation and documentation conversion.\n- **Key points:**\n  - No signs of malicious code.\n  - Uses nbconvert for notebooks, which is common.\n  - No external network activity or data leaks.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Completely normal build script.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Typical setup with dependency checks, extension compilation, and documentation.\n- **Key points:**\n  - No suspicious code or external communication.\n  - Dependency detection via compilation attempts is standard.\n  - No obfuscation or backdoors.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Safe, standard build process.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The only potential concern is the use of `exec()` to run `version.py` in Report 1, which is a common but sometimes risky practice if `version.py` is compromised. However, this is a well-known pattern in setup scripts and not inherently malicious.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports show no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Very low across all reports, primarily due to standard practices.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package with Cython extensions.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- The only minor concern is the dynamic execution of `version.py`, which is common but could be risky if the file is tampered with.\n\n### My recommended scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to account for the `exec()` but still low)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no malicious intent. The setup process is standard, and no security issues are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.2\n\nThis reflects a typical, secure build script with minimal concerns.",
