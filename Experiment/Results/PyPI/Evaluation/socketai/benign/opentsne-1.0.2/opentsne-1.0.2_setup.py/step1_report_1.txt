  "purpose": "Setup script for building and installing the openTSNE Python package with optional extensions and documentation conversion.",
  "sources": "Imports modules; reads files such as README.rst and version.py; dynamically checks for system libraries (fftw3, omp); compiles C/C++ extensions; executes version.py; processes notebooks for documentation.",
  "sinks": "Potential code execution via exec() on version.py; reading and writing files; system calls through compiler; dynamic extension compilation based on system libraries; notebook conversion code.",
  "flows": "exec() reads and executes version.py -> sets __version__; get_include() and get_library_dirs() use system paths; has_c_library() compiles temporary files to check system libraries; build_extensions() compiles C++ extensions; run() converts notebooks to documentation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute version.py (potential code execution risk); dynamic compilation based on system library checks; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious system commands; standard package setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a setup script for a Python package with Cython extensions. It dynamically checks for system libraries like fftw3 and omp to conditionally include extensions. The exec() call executes version.py to set the package version, which can be risky if version.py is compromised. The notebook conversion class uses nbconvert to generate documentation. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or secret data appear present. The code uses standard build and compile procedures, with checks for system capabilities. No network connections or data exfiltration methods are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for building a Python package with Cython extensions. The use of exec() on version.py is a potential security concern but is common in setup scripts for dynamic versioning. No malicious behavior or malware is evident. Overall, the code is standard and does not exhibit malicious intent.",
