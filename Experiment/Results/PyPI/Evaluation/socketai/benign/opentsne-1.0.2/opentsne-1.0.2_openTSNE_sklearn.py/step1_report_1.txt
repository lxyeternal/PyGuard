{
  "purpose": "This code defines a subclass of the openTSNE.TSNE class to customize the fit, fit_transform, and transform methods for dimensionality reduction tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters X and optionally y; it accesses self.embedding_ for transformation.",
  "sinks": "Transformations on self.embedding_ and return of np.ndarray views; no external sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input X to fit/fit_transform, then to self.embedding_; transformations occur via super().fit and self.embedding_.transform, with results returned as np.ndarray views.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; no obfuscation, malicious network activity, or privacy violations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code extends a known TSNE class for embedding data, adding custom fit and transform methods. It uses standard NumPy operations and class inheritance. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious network activity, or data exfiltration. All data handling appears to be straightforward and intended for dimensionality reduction tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard extension of openTSNE for embedding purposes with no detected malicious behavior or security risks.",
