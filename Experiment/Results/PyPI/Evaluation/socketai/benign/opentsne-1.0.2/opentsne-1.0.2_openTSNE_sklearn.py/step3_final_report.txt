  "purpose": "A subclass of openTSNE.TSNE providing customized fit, fit_transform, and transform methods for data embedding.",
  "sources": "Input data matrix X and optional labels y, stored embedding in self.embedding_",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or system modifications detected",
  "flows": "Data flows from input X through fit/transform methods to produce low-dimensional embeddings stored in self.embedding_",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward subclass wrapping openTSNE.TSNE methods, overriding fit, fit_transform, and transform primarily to call superclass methods and return numpy array views. No external network, file I/O, or malicious operations are present. The use of self.fit_transform calling super().fit(X) instead of fit_transform is unconventional but not malicious. The code does not perform any suspicious actions or contain obfuscation. The data processing appears standard, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of openTSNE.TSNE, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The minor scores assigned in previous reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate, but given the benign nature, setting the securityRisk to 0.0 would be more accurate. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
