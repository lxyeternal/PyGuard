  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of openTSNE.TSNE, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The minor scores assigned in previous reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate, but given the benign nature, setting the securityRisk to 0.0 would be more accurate. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
