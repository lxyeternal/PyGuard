{
  "purpose": "The code extends the openTSNE library to customize the TSNE class with additional fit, fit_transform, and transform methods for dimensionality reduction.",
  "sources": "Input data matrix X provided to fit, fit_transform, and transform methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not send data to external systems or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input data (X) flows into fit, fit_transform, and transform methods; the data is processed and embedded within the class, with no external data output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward extension of a known library without obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of openTSNE.TSNE with overridden methods for fitting and transforming data. The fit method calls fit_transform, which performs a fit and stores the embedding. The transform method applies the stored embedding to new data. No external network calls, data leaks, or code injection points are evident. The code solely operates within the data processing scope of the openTSNE library. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard extension of the openTSNE library for dimensionality reduction. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. It functions solely to provide a customized interface for TSNE operations.",
