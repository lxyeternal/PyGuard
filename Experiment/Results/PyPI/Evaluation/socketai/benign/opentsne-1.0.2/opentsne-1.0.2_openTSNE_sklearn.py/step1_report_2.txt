{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom subclass of the openTSNE.TSNE class to provide a modified interface for fitting and transforming data embeddings.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters X in fit, fit_transform, and transform methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data leading to data leaks or security effects; the code does not perform network operations, file I/O, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data from X flows into the fit, fit_transform, and transform methods, and the embedding is stored in self.embedding_; no external data or untrusted sources are processed beyond this.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and leverages openTSNE library methods directly.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a subclass of openTSNE.TSNE, overriding fit, fit_transform, and transform to customize behavior. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or system manipulation is present. The methods primarily handle numpy arrays and call existing library functions. The code appears to be a thin wrapper around openTSNE with no suspicious logic or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign subclass implementation for handling TSNE embeddings, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks.",
