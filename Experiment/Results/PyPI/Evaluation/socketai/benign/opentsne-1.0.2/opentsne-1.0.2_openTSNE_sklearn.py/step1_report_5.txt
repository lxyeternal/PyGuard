{
  "purpose": "The code extends the openTSNE.TSNE class to add custom fit, fit_transform, and transform methods for dimensionality reduction.",
  "sources": "Input data X, used in fit, fit_transform, and transform methods",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data is sent to external systems or files",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method parameters into the TSNE fit/transform processes; no external or network flow observed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. Usage of .view(np.ndarray) is standard for numpy array manipulations",
  "analysis": "The code imports openTSNE and numpy, then subclasses openTSNE.TSNE. It overrides fit, fit_transform, and transform methods, primarily calling the superclass methods and adjusting the returned objects. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration observed. The code appears to be a straightforward extension for dimensionality reduction tasks without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard subclass extension for TSNE with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs data embedding tasks and does not include any malicious or suspicious features.",
