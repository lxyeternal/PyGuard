  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting and formatting SI, binary, and time units, including parsing unit strings and scaling values accordingly.",
  "sources": "Regex parsing of unit strings, input parameters for values and units",
  "sinks": "No external data access, network calls, or data leaks; functions operate solely on input parameters",
  "flows": "Input values and units are parsed and scaled within functions; no external data flows or untrusted data sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard regex usage and mathematical operations",
  "analysis": "The code provides conversion and formatting utilities for SI, binary, and time units, employing regex for parsing unit strings and mathematical calculations for scaling. It does not access external resources, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. Regex patterns are standard and used solely for parsing prefixes and powers. The functions are well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk mostly 0) are consistent with the benign and utility nature of the code. Minor securityRisk scores of 0.1 are slightly above zero but justified by the regex parsing, which is safe in this context. Overall, the code is a safe, well-structured utility module with no malicious or suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility library for unit conversions and formatting, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
