{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for unit conversions, formatting, and scaling of SI and binary units, as well as time formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as 'value', 'unit', 'from_unit', 'to_unit' in functions like convert, format_si, scale_si, format_binary, scale_binary, and format_time.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data directly leading to data leaks or system effects. No network, file, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through scaling, conversion, and formatting functions, with no external data or untrusted sources affecting system behavior beyond basic numeric operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are evident. The code performs straightforward mathematical conversions and formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly handles numerical conversions and formatting for SI and binary units, utilizing regex to parse units and calculating appropriate scaling factors. No external data fetching, command execution, or suspicious logic present. No obfuscated code features or malicious patterns detected. The functions are self-contained, perform predictable operations, and do not exhibit behaviors typical of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility library for unit conversions and formatting, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It is safe to use from a security perspective.",
