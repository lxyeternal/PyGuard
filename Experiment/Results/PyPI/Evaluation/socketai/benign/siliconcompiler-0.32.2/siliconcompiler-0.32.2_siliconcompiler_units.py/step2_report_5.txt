  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a benign utility for unit conversions and formatting. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable. The confidence is high (0.95), aligning with the thoroughness.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, consistent, and appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it confirms the code's benign nature, with standard regex parsing and no external data access.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Well-founded and consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Also aligns with prior assessments, noting straightforward operations and no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Continues to confirm the code as a standard utility with no malicious behavior. Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) possibly due to the regex parsing, but still within a reasonable range given the context.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: a straightforward utility with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0 to 0.1, primarily due to regex parsing, which is standard and safe here.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a well-structured, standard utility module for unit conversions and formatting.\n- No external data access, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- Regex patterns are straightforward and used solely for parsing prefixes and powers.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a benign, standard utility library for unit conversions and formatting. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
