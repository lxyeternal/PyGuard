{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for unit conversions and formatting related to SI units, binary units, and time, mainly for scientific and engineering applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input values for conversions and formatting, such as 'value', 'unit', and 'digits'. It also parses units to extract prefixes and powers.",
  "sinks": "The code performs mathematical operations and string formatting, but no sinks indicate untrusted data leading to security breaches like code injection or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input values are read at function parameters; computations involve mathematical and regex-based prefix extraction; output is formatted strings or floats. No dangerous flows to external systems are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The regex patterns are standard for prefix extraction. The code appears straightforward and legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for unit conversions and formatting. It employs regex for parsing unit strings, uses math operations for scale calculations, and formats output strings. No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. Functions like 'convert', 'format_si', 'scale_si', etc., operate solely on input arguments with no evident malicious intent. The regex patterns are standard for extracting SI prefixes and powers. The overall structure is clear, with no suspicious code segments. Therefore, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for unit conversions and formatting, with no malicious behavior detected. It performs straightforward mathematical operations and string manipulations typical of scientific utility libraries. No security risks or malware signs are present.",
