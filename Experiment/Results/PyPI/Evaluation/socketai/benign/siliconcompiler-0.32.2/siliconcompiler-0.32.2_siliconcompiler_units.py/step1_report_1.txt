{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for unit conversions and formatting related to SI, binary, and time units.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function arguments such as 'value', 'unit', 'to_unit', and 'from_unit'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are data formatting and calculations, with no evidence of data leakage or external data access.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through conversion, scaling, and formatting functions, with no external network or file I/O.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs mathematical conversions and string formatting based on standard unit prefixes and types. It utilizes regex for parsing unit strings and mathematical functions for scaling, all within expected and safe operations. No external calls, network access, or file operations are present. The functions are typical utility routines for unit handling, with proper checks for unit types and formats. There is no indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code appears well-structured and adheres to standard practices for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for unit conversions and formatting. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated or suspicious code, and no security risks based on the provided content.",
