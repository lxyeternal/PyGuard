{
  "purpose": "Provide functions for converting, scaling, and formatting SI, binary, and time units.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as value, unit, from_unit, to_unit.",
  "sinks": "Return values from functions, especially formatted strings or scaled numerical values.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed and transformed through calculations, regex parsing, and formatting functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscated code. The regex patterns are standard for parsing units. No external data fetching or system commands are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit conversions and formatting for SI, binary, and time units. It uses regex for parsing units and scales values accordingly. No external network calls, file I/O, or system modifications are evident. The functions are purely mathematical and formatting utilities. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code's structure and content suggest it is a utility module for unit handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward utility library for unit conversions and formatting with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks identified.",
