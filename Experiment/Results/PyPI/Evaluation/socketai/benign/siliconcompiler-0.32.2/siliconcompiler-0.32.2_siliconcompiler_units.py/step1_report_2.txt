{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for unit conversions, scaling, and formatting for SI and binary units, as well as time formatting.",
  "sources": "No explicit external data sources or user input read within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform external operations such as network or filesystem access.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the functions perform internal calculations and formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The code uses regular expressions for parsing units but does so in a standard manner. No obfuscation or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several constants for SI and binary units and their scales. Functions include converting values between units, formatting numbers with SI or binary prefixes, and time formatting. The regex patterns for extracting prefixes and powers are standard and do not perform any unsafe operations. No dynamic code execution, network access, or sensitive data handling present. The logic is straightforward and consistent with typical unit conversion utilities. No suspicious or malicious code elements are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for unit conversions and formatting. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. No evidence of malware or security issues was found.",
