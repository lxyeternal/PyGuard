{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal entry point that imports the 'sc' module from 'siliconcompiler.apps' and executes its main function.",
  "sources": "The code reads no untrusted input; it imports a module and calls a function.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the call to 'sc.main()', which could perform internal actions, but no untrusted data flows are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the script execution to 'sc.main()' invocation; no data flows are visible.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard Python script that imports a module and calls its main function. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'sc.main()', which is external and unknown. Given the simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns, the code is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is best set at 0.1 to acknowledge the dependency on external code but reflect the minimal inherent risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward entry point with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, aligning with the minimal and safe nature of this snippet.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
