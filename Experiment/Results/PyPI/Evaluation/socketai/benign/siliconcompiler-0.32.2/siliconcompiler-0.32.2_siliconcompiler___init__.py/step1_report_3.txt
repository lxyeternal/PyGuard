{
  "purpose": "The code primarily imports modules and functions from the siliconcompiler package and defines an export list (__all__). It appears to set up the namespace for a larger silicon compilation framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from siliconcompiler._common, siliconcompiler.utils, siliconcompiler.core, siliconcompiler.schema, siliconcompiler._metadata, and siliconcompiler.use.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or output. No user input, network, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The code only imports modules and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The code is straightforward and standard for module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from the siliconcompiler package and defines __all__ for module exports. The purpose appears to be setting up the module's namespace for external use. There are no dynamic code executions, external data processing, or security-sensitive operations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are present. The code is purely structural and declarative.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import and export declaration without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
