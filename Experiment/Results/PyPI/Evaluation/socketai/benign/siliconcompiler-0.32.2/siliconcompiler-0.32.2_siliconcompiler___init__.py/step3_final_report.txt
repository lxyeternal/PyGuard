  "purpose": "Module initialization and symbol export setup for the siliconcompiler package.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from siliconcompiler modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows.",
  "flows": "None; static imports do not involve data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static imports from known modules, defines an __all__ list for public API exposure, and contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or data processing. It functions as a standard __init__.py or module setup script, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The reasoning is consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup script with no malicious or security issues. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with its behavior.",
