  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate profiling utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the dynamic module loading with user input, which could be exploited if `_load_module` executes untrusted code. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is moderate (~0.4). Proper validation of `extra` or safe implementation of `_load_module` would mitigate this risk."
