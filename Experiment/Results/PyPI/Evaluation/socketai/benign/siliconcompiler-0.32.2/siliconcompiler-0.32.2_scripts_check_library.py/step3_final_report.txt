{
  "purpose": "The code automates hardware verification workflows using SiliconCompiler, loading modules, setting options, and executing checks.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from command-line arguments specifying target and libraries; modules are loaded via internal '_load_module' functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data exfiltration points are present; the code primarily configures and runs verification flows internally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from command-line inputs to module loading, configuration, and execution of 'chip.run()' without external system calls or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal functions like '_load_module' is unconventional and potentially unstable but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward automation tool for hardware verification, relying on internal APIs. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The reliance on internal functions is noted but not malicious. The code performs configuration and execution within a known framework, with no external or covert activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign automation script with no malicious intent or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the slight concern about internal API reliance does not imply malicious behavior.",
