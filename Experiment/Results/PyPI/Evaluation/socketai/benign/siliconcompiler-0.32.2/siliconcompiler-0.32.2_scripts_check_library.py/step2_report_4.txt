  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It parses command-line arguments for target and libraries.\n- Loads modules via internal functions (`_load_module`).\n- Sets options and iterates over libraries, skipping those starting with `'lambdalib_'`.\n- Uses the SiliconCompiler API to perform checks (`chip.use()`, `chip.set()`, `chip.run()`).\n- No external system calls, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- Uses internal functions which are somewhat unconventional but not suspicious.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on the code:\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No, the code appears straightforward and aligned with typical SiliconCompiler workflows.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No significant errors are apparent. The use of internal functions (`_load_module`) is unconventional but not inherently problematic.\n\n- **Scores (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 or 0.1, which seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n- **Risk justification:**  \n  Since the code is a utility script orchestrating known APIs without malicious behavior, a low risk score (~0.2) is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports agree on malware=0, which is justified.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports avoid speculative claims and focus on observable code behavior.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code and its context.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The main concern is the use of internal methods (`_load_module`), which could be unstable or undocumented, but this is a known pattern in some frameworks and does not imply malicious intent.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are present.\n- The code's purpose is clear: automate library checks within a hardware design flow.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to reliance on internal APIs but no security threat)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nConsidering all points, I agree with the consensus scores. The code is a straightforward automation script with no malicious intent, minimal security risk, and no obfuscation.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, with a very low security risk, primarily due to internal API reliance rather than malicious behavior.",
