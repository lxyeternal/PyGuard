The low security risk score is justified by its straightforward nature and safe handling of inputs. The malware score is correctly set to zero. Overall, the code is safe for use in production environments, and the reports accurately reflect this."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate profiling utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the dynamic module loading with user input, which could be exploited if `_load_module` executes untrusted code. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is moderate (~0.4). Proper validation of `extra` or safe implementation of `_load_module` would mitigate this risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured hardware flow management framework with no signs of malware or malicious sabotage. The primary security concern is schema integrity, which could be exploited if schema data is compromised. Implementing strict validation, whitelisting modules, and verifying schema sources can mitigate these risks. Overall, the system's security posture is low risk with moderate attack surface points related to dynamic module loading."
