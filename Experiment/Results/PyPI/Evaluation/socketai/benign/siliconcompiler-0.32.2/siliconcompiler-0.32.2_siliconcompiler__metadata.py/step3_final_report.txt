  "purpose": "Static configuration and display data for the SiliconCompiler project, including version, server URL, contributor list, and ASCII banner.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings for version, server URL, authors list, and ASCII banner.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, input, or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data without data flow or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward static configuration with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variables defining version info, server URL, authors, and an ASCII banner. There are no functions, input/output, dynamic code execution, or external data handling. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are correctly set to 0, reflecting the benign and static nature of the code. Confidence is high (1) due to the straightforward static analysis. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, benign configuration snippet with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The existing scores are appropriate and justified. No further action needed.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
