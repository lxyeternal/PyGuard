  "purpose": "Define metadata, contributors, and display banner information for the SiliconCompiler project.",
  "sources": "None; all variables are static strings or lists defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data inputs, outputs, or external connections are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks since the code only sets static variables and displays a banner.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code contains standard metadata and banner definition with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static data definitions such as version, server URL, contributors list, and an ASCII art banner. There are no input operations, no dynamic code execution, and no external data handling. All content appears to be static and intended for informational or display purposes only. The absence of any input/output operations, network activity, or suspicious logic indicates no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign configuration and display module for the SiliconCompiler project. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities.",
