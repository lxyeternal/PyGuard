{
  "purpose": "Define metadata and configuration for the SiliconCompiler project, including version, server address, contributors, and display banner.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings for version, server URL, authors list, and banner string.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output or external systems; static data is assigned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden logic; straightforward static assignments and a large ASCII banner.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments: version info, server URL, authors list, and a banner string generated with pyfiglet. All data is hardcoded, with no input handling, external data processing, or dynamic execution. No code injection points, no environment variable usage, and no network activity are present. The banner is a static ASCII art string, not dynamically generated at runtime with external data. The code does not include any suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely configuration and static display data with no malicious intent. It does not perform any network operations, data processing, or hidden actions. There is no evidence of malware or security risks in this fragment.",
