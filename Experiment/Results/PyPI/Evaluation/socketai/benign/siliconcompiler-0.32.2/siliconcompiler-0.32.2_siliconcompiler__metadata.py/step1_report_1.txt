  "purpose": "To define versioning, server configuration, contributors, and display banner information for the SiliconCompiler project.",
  "sources": "None; all data are hardcoded string literals and list definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input, data leaks, or external data manipulations are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist as there is no data processing or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious patterns; the code consists of static configuration and display strings.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static configuration, defining version info, server URL, contributor list, and an ASCII banner. No input/output, network connections, or data manipulations are present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. It appears to serve as a project configuration or display module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks detected. It is straightforward and static in nature.",
