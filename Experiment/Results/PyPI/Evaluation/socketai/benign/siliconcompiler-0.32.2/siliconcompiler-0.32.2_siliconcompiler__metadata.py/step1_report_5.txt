  "purpose": "Define package metadata including version, server address, contributors, and display banner for SiliconCompiler.",
  "sources": "Read-only variable assignments and string literals for version, server URL, author list, and ASCII banner.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; all data is hardcoded static strings or list literals.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from external input to any critical operation; the code simply assigns static values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials (beyond version and URL which are standard), or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward variable assignments for versioning, server URL, contributor list, and a banner string generated with pyfiglet. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no runtime dynamic behavior. The banner is a static string literal. No functions, network calls, or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears to serve as package metadata and display elements only.",
  "conclusion": "This source code contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely static data used for package metadata and presentation purposes. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security threats are evident.",
