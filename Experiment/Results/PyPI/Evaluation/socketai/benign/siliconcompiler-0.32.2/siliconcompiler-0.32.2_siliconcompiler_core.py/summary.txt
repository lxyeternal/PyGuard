  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured hardware flow management framework with no signs of malware or malicious sabotage. The primary security concern is schema integrity, which could be exploited if schema data is compromised. Implementing strict validation, whitelisting modules, and verifying schema sources can mitigate these risks. Overall, the system's security posture is low risk with moderate attack surface points related to dynamic module loading."
