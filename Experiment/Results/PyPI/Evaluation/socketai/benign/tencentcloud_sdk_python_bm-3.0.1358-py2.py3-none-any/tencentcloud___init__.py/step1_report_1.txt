  "purpose": "The code appears to be a licensing and version declaration for a Python package, possibly part of a larger open-source project.",
  "sources": "Metadata comments, license text, version string assignment (__version__ = '3.0.1358')",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; only static metadata assignments and comments",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors; the license comments are standard and do not perform any actions",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of license information, copyright notices, and a version string declaration. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. All content is static and standard for open-source projects. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs are present. The code does not include any potentially malicious logic or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard header for an open-source project with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is solely metadata and licensing information, with no indication of malicious behavior or security concerns.",
