{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a metadata header containing licensing information and a version identifier for an open-source project.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns a static version string.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects, as the code is static and non-executable.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code contains only a simple assignment statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is standard licensing and version info.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static metadata with comments and a single version string assignment. It contains no functions, data processing, or dynamic behavior. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is typical for open-source headers, and the comments are standard licensing notices. Given its static and benign nature, there are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard open-source header containing licensing and version information, with no malicious or security concerns. All signals indicate it is safe and non-malicious.",
