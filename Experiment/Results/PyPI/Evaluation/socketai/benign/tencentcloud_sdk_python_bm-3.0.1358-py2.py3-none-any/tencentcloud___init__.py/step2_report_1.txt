  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Nature:**\n   - The code is purely static, consisting of comments, license notices, and a single version string assignment (`__version__ = '3.0.1358'`).\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external data reads, or any executable logic.\n   - The comments are standard licensing and copyright notices, typical for open-source projects.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Elements:**\n   - No obfuscated code, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n   - The code does not perform any data flow, input/output, or dynamic actions.\n   - The only active statement is setting a version string, which is benign.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is metadata-only, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a standard header or metadata block.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security concerns are detected.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, justified by the absence of any executable or risky code.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns & Clarifications:**\n   - Since the code is just metadata, there is no reason to assign any higher risk or malware scores.\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable in their assessments.\n\n6. **Final Recommendation:**\n   - Based on the provided code and reports, I concur that there is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n   - The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code fragment is a standard open-source header with no security concerns.",
