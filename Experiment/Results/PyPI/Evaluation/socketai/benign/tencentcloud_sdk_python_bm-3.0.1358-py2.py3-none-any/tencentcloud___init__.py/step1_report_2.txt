  "purpose": "The provided code snippet appears to be the header or metadata for a Python package or module, containing licensing information, version number, and licensing terms.",
  "sources": "No data input sources or external data reads are present in this code snippet.",
  "targets": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or other security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists in this static metadata snippet, as there are no source or sink interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of comments, licensing info, and a version assignment. No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, including licensing comments and a version variable. It does not perform any computation, input/output, or data handling that could introduce security concerns. Since it is a standard header or metadata, it does not contain malware or malicious intent. The only active statement is setting a version string, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard licensing header with a version declaration. It does not include any malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
