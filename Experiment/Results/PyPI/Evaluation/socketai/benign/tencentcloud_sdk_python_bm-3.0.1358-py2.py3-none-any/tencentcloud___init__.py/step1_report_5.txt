{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set metadata information for a Python package or module, specifically defining version information and including license notices.",
  "sources": "The code sources include comments, license information, and the __version__ variable declaration.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flow points involving untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets a variable and contains comments.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard licensing comments and a version variable; no anomalies or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, containing license notices, version string assignment, and no executable logic. It does not process input, access external data, or perform any actions that could be malicious. The comments reflect licensing terms, and the version variable is a simple string assignment. No code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears typical of open-source project headers.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard license and version declaration snippet with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is typical of open-source modules and contains no malware or security concerns.",
