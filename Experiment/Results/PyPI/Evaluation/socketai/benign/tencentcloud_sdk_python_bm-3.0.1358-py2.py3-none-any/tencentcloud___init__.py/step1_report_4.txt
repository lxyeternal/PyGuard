{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define metadata for a software package, including licensing information and versioning.",
  "sources": "Comments and metadata variables such as __version__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output points identified",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only licensing comments and version variable; no executable code or data handling",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing information, copyright notices, and a version variable assignment. There are no functions, data processing, or executable logic. It does not read input, handle untrusted data, or perform any operations that could be exploited. The code is a typical header or metadata section found in many open-source files. No malicious patterns or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This file contains only licensing and metadata comments along with a version variable. It does not contain executable code or any behavior that could be malicious or pose security risks.",
