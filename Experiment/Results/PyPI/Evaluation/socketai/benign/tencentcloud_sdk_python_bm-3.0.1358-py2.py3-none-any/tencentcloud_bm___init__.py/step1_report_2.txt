  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a utility script for data processing or system interaction, but the exact goal cannot be determined due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from environment variables, file inputs, and possibly network or user inputs (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write/read operations, subprocess executions, or sensitive data exposure points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or user inputs towards processing functions, then potentially towards output or network sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are detected. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors are evident based on the provided code.",
  "analysis": "A thorough line-by-line review shows standard usage of Python functions, with no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or unauthorized system access. The code lacks suspicious network connections, hardcoded secrets, or unusual dynamic execution. The structure appears typical for a utility or processing script, and no malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to serve an ordinary purpose without harmful intent. Confidence in this conclusion is high.",
