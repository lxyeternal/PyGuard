  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Untrusted input handling, dynamic code execution functions (eval, exec), hardcoded secrets, external data fetches, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network communications, file modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as user input or external data flow into eval/exec or network functions, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, use of eval/exec on untrusted data, hardcoded credentials or URLs, suspicious dynamic code execution, inconsistent code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits potential security concerns primarily when it employs eval/exec with untrusted inputs, which can lead to code injection. Obfuscation suspicion (score ~0.6) aligns with the suspected malicious patterns. Benign code shows no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. Insufficient or missing code results in low confidence assessments. Overall, the primary risk stems from unsafe functions and obfuscation in Report 1, warranting a higher malware score if confirmed malicious usage. Other reports appear benign, with scores consistent with their descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "Report 1 demonstrates moderate suspicion due to unsafe functions and obfuscation, justifying a malware score around 0.4–0.5 and a security risk near 0.55. If eval/exec are confirmed to process untrusted data maliciously, the malware score should be increased to approximately 0.8. The remaining reports are benign, with scores appropriately reflecting their lack of suspicious features.",
