  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the implementation of a Python package or module, but without the actual code provided, the specific intent cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include input functions, environment variables, configuration files, or network calls if present. Since no code is provided, specific sources cannot be identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network transmissions, file writes, or eval/exec calls that could process untrusted data. No specific sinks are identifiable without code.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks cannot be established without concrete code snippets; thus, no source-to-sink paths can be identified.",
  "anomalies": "No code provided to analyze for anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "No code was supplied for review. Therefore, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be conducted. The review cannot identify any malicious patterns, anomalies, or security issues without actual code content.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to assess code security or malicious intent without code input. The code review cannot be performed, and no malicious behavior or security risks can be confirmed.",
