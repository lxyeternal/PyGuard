  "conclusion": "Report 1 demonstrates moderate suspicion due to unsafe functions and obfuscation, justifying a malware score around 0.4–0.5 and a security risk near 0.55. If eval/exec are confirmed to process untrusted data maliciously, the malware score should be increased to approximately 0.8. The remaining reports are benign, with scores appropriately reflecting their lack of suspicious features."
