  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of static string constants defining error codes and messages.\n- No input handling, data processing, network communication, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or anomalies are identified.\n- The code is licensed under an open-source license, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The consistent conclusion is that the code is benign and part of a larger system, likely for error handling.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippet is purely defining constants; there are no sinks, sources, or data flows that could be exploited.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- The reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores all at 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are 1, indicating high certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The analysis and scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- There are no assumptions about vulnerabilities; the code is straightforward.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, no security risk identified.\n\n**Final notes:**\n- No changes needed; the evaluation is accurate.\n- This code is a standard, benign component defining error constants, with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, non-malicious, and well-understood.\n- The scores and reasoning are justified and aligned with the content.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- No further action required.",
