  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, as well as any discrepancies or concerns.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static constant definitions for error codes/messages.\n- No input/output, data processing, or network activity is present.\n- No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be a standard part of an SDK or API error handling module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. This aligns with the code's nature as simple constant definitions.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- **Logical or reasoning errors?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward, static constant definitions with no security concerns.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All assign 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No issues warrant a risk score higher than 0.5. The code is purely static, with no dynamic behavior or external data handling.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All reports avoid assumptions and correctly conclude that the code is non-malicious.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard set of error code constants with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is harmless, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo further action needed.",
