{
  "purpose": "This code defines a series of constant string variables representing error codes and messages, likely used for error handling and reporting in a larger application or SDK.",
  "sources": "The code contains only static variable assignments and comments; no input or data reading points are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks, as no untrusted data processing, output, or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists, as the code only defines constants without processing or data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code is straightforward and well-commented.",
  "analysis": "The code provides error code constants with descriptive comments, intended for use in error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The comments and license headers are standard for open-source SDKs or API client libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of error code definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as part of an error handling mechanism and does not introduce vulnerabilities.",
