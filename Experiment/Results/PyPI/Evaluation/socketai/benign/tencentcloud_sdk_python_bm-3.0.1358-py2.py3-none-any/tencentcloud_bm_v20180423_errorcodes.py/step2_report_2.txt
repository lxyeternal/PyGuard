  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static constant definitions of error codes and messages.\n- No input handling, data processing, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger SDK or API error handling framework.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n- The error code constants are straightforward, with no embedded logic or external dependencies.\n- The licensing comments are standard and do not indicate any malicious intent.\n\n**Potential issues or flaws:**\n- The reports are accurate; the code is benign and purely declarative.\n- No logical errors, security flaws, or suspicious anomalies are evident.\n- The code's purpose is clear: defining error codes for use elsewhere.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Risk scores:**\n- Since the code is just static constants, the risk score should remain low, around 0.0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern.\n- No reason to increase the score given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a benign, standard set of error code definitions.\n- No modifications needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, as it’s just constants)\n\nThis aligns with the reports’ findings and the nature of the code.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and correctly identify that this code is safe and standard. No further security concerns are warranted here.",
