{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of constant string error codes and messages for handling various operational errors, such as parameter errors, resource issues, and authorization problems, within a larger system or API.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded string assignments that represent error codes and messages.",
  "fires": "Potentially, these constants could be used in logging or exception handling, but there are no direct data sinks or untrusted data inputs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or output in this code; it is purely defining static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code consists solely of static variable assignments and licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of constant error codes and messages, with no input handling, no data processing, and no external communication. It appears to be part of a larger codebase, serving as a reference for error identifiers. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The license comments indicate open-source licensing terms. No obfuscated code, data leaks, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign set of constant definitions for error codes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks.",
