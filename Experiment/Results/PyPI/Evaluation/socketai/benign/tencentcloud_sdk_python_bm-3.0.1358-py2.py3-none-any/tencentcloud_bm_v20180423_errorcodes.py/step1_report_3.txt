{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of string constants representing various error codes and statuses related to operational failures, parameter issues, resource limitations, and authorization problems.",
  "sources": "The code assigns string literals to variables at the global scope.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or data sinks are present; the code only contains static definitions.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows, input processing, or data handling that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors. It solely contains constant string assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static string assignments used as identifiers or error codes. No input/output operations, data processing, or logic are present. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity is detectable. The content appears to be part of a larger system, serving as a reference or response code definitions. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a set of predefined constants for error handling. It shows no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, non-sensitive component of a larger software system.",
