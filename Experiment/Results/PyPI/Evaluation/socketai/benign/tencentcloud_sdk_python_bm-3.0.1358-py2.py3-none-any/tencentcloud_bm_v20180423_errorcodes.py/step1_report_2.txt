{
  "purpose": "This code defines a series of constant string variables representing different error codes and messages, likely used for error handling within a larger application or SDK.",
  "sources": "These variables are defined directly in the code as string assignments, with no input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed, output, or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists, as the code only initializes constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward, with clear variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains constant definitions for error codes, with licensing information and no logic, data processing, or network activity. It appears to be part of a larger SDK or library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The content is standard for error code definitions and contains no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign set of constant definitions for error handling, with no malicious intent or security issues identified. It is a standard component likely used for managing error states in a system.",
