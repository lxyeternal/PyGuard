{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of static error code constants and messages for use in an SDK or API, serving as standardized identifiers for various operational statuses and errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only from the static constant definitions; no external data sources or input mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code only declares constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative with no dynamic execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string constants representing error codes and messages, accompanied by licensing comments. It contains no logic, data handling, network activity, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. There are no signs of backdoors, malicious code, or security flaws. The code's purpose is to serve as a standardized set of error identifiers within a larger system, and it poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of error code constants with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
