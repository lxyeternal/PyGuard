  "purpose": "A Python source code refactoring utility designed to remove unused imports and clean code by analyzing ASTs, managing file I/O, and rewriting source files accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reads source code from files or stdin, parsing ASTs, and analyzing import usage; accesses external modules via dynamic import.",
  "sinks": "Writes refactored code back to files or stdout, and reports analysis results; no external network or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "Source code is read, parsed into AST, analyzed for unused imports, then transformed and written back, with error handling and reporting throughout.",
  "anomalies": "Uses controlled dynamic import (`import_module`) for the 'transform' module (LibCST) for performance; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured static analysis and refactoring tool. It employs safe file operations, AST parsing, and import analysis. The dynamic import of 'transform' is a performance optimization, not malicious. No network activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code are present. Exception handling is broad but standard for such tools. No suspicious patterns or payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, low-risk Python refactoring utility with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The controlled dynamic import and clear structure indicate safe operation. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is approximately 0.1–0.2, primarily due to the dynamic import pattern, which is benign in context.",
