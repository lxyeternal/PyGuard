  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, low-risk Python refactoring utility with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The controlled dynamic import and clear structure indicate safe operation. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is approximately 0.1–0.2, primarily due to the dynamic import pattern, which is benign in context."
