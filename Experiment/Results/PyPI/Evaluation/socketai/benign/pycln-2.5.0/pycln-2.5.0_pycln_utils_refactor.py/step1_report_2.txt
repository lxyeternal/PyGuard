{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility for refactoring Python source files by removing unused imports and cleaning up code structure, including AST parsing and manipulation.",
  "sources": "Reads source code from files or stdin, especially in methods like session() and _code_session(). Uses imported modules like iou.safe_read() and regexu.skip_file().",
  "sinks": "Writes refactored code back to files via iou.safe_write() and outputs diffs or stdout through reporter methods. No external untrusted data sinks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Sources (file reading, stdin, regex skips) → AST parsing and analysis → Potential refactoring actions → writing back or outputting diffs/stderr.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs detected. Usage of dynamic imports for LibCST is noted, but this is for performance optimization, not malicious activity. No obfuscated code or malicious side-effects are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed for code refactoring, analyzing ASTs, removing unused imports, and rewriting source code. It uses standard Python modules (ast, os, sys) and well-structured methods for parsing, analyzing, and rewriting code. No indications of malicious intent or malicious side effects are present. The only dynamic behavior involves lazy importing of LibCST for performance reasons, which is benign. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or harmful system modifications are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate utility for Python code cleanup with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. Its operations are confined to source code analysis and rewriting without any suspicious side effects.",
