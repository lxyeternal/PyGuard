{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility for refactoring Python source files by removing unused imports and simplifying code, aiming to improve code quality and maintainability.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from file paths or standard input, parses source code into AST, and accesses files via 'iou.safe_read'. It also loads external modules dynamically with 'import_module'.",
  "sinks": "The code potentially writes refactored code back to files using 'iou.safe_write'. It also loads modules dynamically which could be manipulated if external inputs influence 'import_module'.",
  "flows": "Input source code is read from files or stdin, parsed into AST, analyzed for import usage, and then potentially rewritten. Data flows from file input → AST parsing → analysis of import usage → AST transformation → file output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The dynamic import loader is protected within a class, and no obfuscated code or suspicious external network activity is evident. No malicious side-effects or privacy violations are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a refactoring utility that operates on source files, parsing and analyzing ASTs to remove unused imports. It uses standard Python modules and safe file reading/writing functions, and dynamic module loading is encapsulated to delay heavy imports. No external network calls, no credential handling, and no obfuscated or suspicious code segments are detected. The dynamic import loader is benign, designed solely to optimize load time. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured tool for code maintenance without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate refactoring utility designed for code quality improvement. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks based on the provided content. Its design is consistent with a secure code maintenance tool, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
