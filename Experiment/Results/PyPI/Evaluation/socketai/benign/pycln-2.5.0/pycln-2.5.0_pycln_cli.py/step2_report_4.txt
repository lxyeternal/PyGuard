  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the security implications, correctness, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe a CLI tool for Python import cleanup/refactoring.\n- The code is primarily about parsing CLI arguments, setting configurations, and invoking file processing sessions.\n- No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The code relies on standard libraries (`pathlib`, `typer`) and internal modules for core logic.\n- The reports uniformly assign malware scores of 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** CLI for a code cleanup tool.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2 (low, due to potential user input risks).\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a typical CLI wrapper with no malware. The low security risk reflects possible misuses of user input, but nothing malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** CLI for a Python import management tool.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behaviors; standard file operations.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Very confident. No malicious behavior detected. The report is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** CLI for import management and refactoring.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The very low security risk is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** CLI for code cleanup.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** CLI for import management.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, standard processing.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate, given the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Consistency & Critical Analysis:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, which is justified; the code is a CLI wrapper with no malicious operations.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, as expected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal potential for user input misuse, which is reasonable.\n\n**Potential issues:**  \nThe code does not perform any unsafe operations, dynamic code execution, or network activity. The only concern might be if user inputs lead to unsafe file operations, but the code seems to handle this via regex filtering and configuration controls.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimations:**\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no evidence of malicious code.  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — straightforward, readable code.  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, mostly related to user input handling, which is typical for CLI tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard CLI interface for a Python import refactoring tool.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code’s behavior.\n- The overall security posture is very low risk.\n\n**My final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Set the risk score around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risks in CLI argument handling.\n\n---\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (round to 0.1 for conservative estimate)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
