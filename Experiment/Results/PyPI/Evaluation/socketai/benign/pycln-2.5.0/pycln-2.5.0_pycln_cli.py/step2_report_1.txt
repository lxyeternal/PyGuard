  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a CLI wrapper for a Python code cleanup tool, with no suspicious or malicious code patterns detected. It emphasizes that the code uses standard libraries and internal modules, and no network, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is primarily argument parsing, configuration setup, and file processing. No evidence of malicious activity. The risk score is low, justified by the absence of suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard CLI handling, configuration, and safe file processing. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. The report correctly identifies the code as a typical CLI for a code cleanup tool, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code manages input, configuration, and file processing for a refactoring tool. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are observed.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's functionality. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a standard CLI interface for a Python import cleaner, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identified as a legitimate CLI tool with minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward CLI for managing Python imports, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature. There are no signs of malicious activity, network access, or code injection.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as clear and straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are very low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the minimal security concern. The code mainly handles argument parsing, configuration, and file processing, all of which are standard and safe.\n\n### **Final Expert Judgment:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear and standard.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1** — Very low, justified by the nature of the code.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nNo evidence suggests any security vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious intent. The code is a typical CLI entry point for a code refactoring tool, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, safe CLI implementation for a Python import cleanup/refactoring tool. The reported scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
