{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a command-line interface (CLI) for the Pycln tool, which manages Python import statements and code cleanup.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments, configuration files, and directory or file paths supplied by the user.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the functions that perform file modifications (`refactor.Refactor.session()`) and output (`typer.echo()`, `exit()`), as well as reading configuration files and patterns for file inclusion/exclusion.",
  "flows": "Input from CLI arguments and config files flows into the `Config` object; then into `Refactor.session()` which potentially modifies files; output and status are relayed via `typer.echo()` and exit code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or network activity. All operations are related to file management and CLI handling. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a CLI entry point for a Python package, setting up command options, configuration, and orchestrating source file processing via `Refactor`. It utilizes user input and config files to determine file sources, patterns, and actions. The code employs standard libraries (`pathlib`, `typer`) and local modules for utility functions, configuration, and reporting. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. The main function handles file selection, configuration, and invoking refactoring sessions securely. The command-line interface options provide typical code cleanup functionalities without any signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI implementation for a code cleanup tool with no malicious behavior detected. It manages configuration, file selection, and processing in a typical and safe manner, with no indicators of malicious payloads or security risks.",
