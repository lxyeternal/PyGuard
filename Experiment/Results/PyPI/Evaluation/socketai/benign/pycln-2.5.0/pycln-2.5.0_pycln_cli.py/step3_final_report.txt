  "purpose": "Implement a CLI interface for a Python import cleanup and refactoring tool, handling argument parsing, configuration, and file processing.",
  "sources": "User inputs via CLI arguments, configuration files, and file system paths",
  "sinks": "File reading/writing, refactoring operations, reporting, and process exit codes",
  "flows": "CLI arguments and options -> configuration setup -> source file enumeration -> refactor session -> reporting and exit",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper utilizing 'typer' for argument parsing, setting up configurations, and invoking internal modules for file processing. It does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe CLI implementation for a Python import cleanup/refactoring tool. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
