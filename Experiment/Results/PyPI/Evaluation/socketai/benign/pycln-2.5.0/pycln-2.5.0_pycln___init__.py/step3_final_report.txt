{
  "purpose": "Add 'vendor' directory to module search path, fix terminal encoding, retrieve package metadata, and provide version info via CLI.",
  "sources": "sys.path modification, sys.stdout/stderr encoding setup, metadata retrieval for 'pycln'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or malicious code execution present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily initializes environment and metadata",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional addition of 'vendor' directory to sys.path could be exploited if directory is malicious, but this is a common pattern in dependency management",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment setup and metadata retrieval with no malicious or obfuscated code. The addition of 'vendor' to sys.path is a potential vector if compromised but is standard practice. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code is straightforward and benign, with the main concern being trustworthiness of the 'vendor' directory. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard setup code with a low security risk primarily due to dependency path modification. No malware or obfuscation detected. The minor risk associated with 'vendor' should be verified but does not constitute malicious activity.",
