{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point to run the Pycln tool as a module, initializing and executing the CLI application.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's __name__ attribute and imports the 'app' object from the 'cli' module.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'app' with a parameter derived from the module's name, which influences the CLI execution; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The module's __name__ is passed to 'app' as 'prog_name', but it is a static value, not user input. The flow is from the module name to the CLI app execution.",
  "anomalies": "The use of '__name__' as 'prog_name' in 'app' is unconventional, but it is not malicious. No other anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the application's CLI component and runs it, passing the module's name as a parameter. There are no external inputs, user data, or environment variables involved. The code appears to be a standard CLI bootstrap, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI entry point for Pycln with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply initializes and runs the application.",
