{
  "purpose": "To serve as the entry point to run the Pycln package as a module, initiating the command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Importing __name__ and the 'app' function from the 'cli' module.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'app' with 'prog_name=__name__' - potential risk if 'app' processes untrusted input or performs unsafe operations, but not inherently suspicious.",
  "flows": "Imports __name__ -> calls app(prog_name=__name__) which passes module name to 'app' function.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __name__ as 'prog_name' is standard for CLI applications; no unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and standard for a Python CLI entry point. It imports necessary modules and initiates the application. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The code simply delegates execution to the 'app' function from 'cli'.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard CLI entry point with no evident malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a typical implementation for launching a command-line interface for the package.",
