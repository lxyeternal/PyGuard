{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point to run the Pycln tool as a module, initializing and executing a CLI application.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name (__name__) and imports the 'app' object from the 'cli' module.",
  "sinks": "The code passes __name__ as 'prog_name' to the 'app' function, which could potentially influence program behavior but does not pose a direct security risk here.",
  "flows": "The module name (__name__) flows into the 'app' function as 'prog_name'. No untrusted data sources or user inputs are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, primarily calling an imported function with the module name; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a straightforward CLI launcher for the Pycln tool, importing and invoking the 'app' object with the module name. It does not handle user input directly nor executes untrusted data. The code is clean, simple, and standard for such entry points, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI entry point with no malicious behavior, security issues, or suspicious anomalies. It simply initializes and runs the Pycln CLI application.",
