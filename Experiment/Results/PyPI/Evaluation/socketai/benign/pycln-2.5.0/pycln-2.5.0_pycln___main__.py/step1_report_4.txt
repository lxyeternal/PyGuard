  "purpose": "Entry point to run the Pycln CLI as a module.",
  "sources": "Importing __name__ and app from .cli",
  "sinks": "Calling app() with __name__ as the program name",
  "flows": "Import __name__ -> app(prog_name=__name__)",
  "anomalies": "Use of __name__ as the program name is standard, no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports __name__ and a CLI application 'app' from a local module. It then executes app() passing __name__ as the program name. There are no data inputs, untrusted sources, or suspicious behaviors. The code is a standard Python CLI entry point with minimal logic, mainly invoking the CLI app. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI entry point for a Python module, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
