{
  "purpose": "Standard CLI entry point that initializes and runs the application.",
  "sources": "Imports __name__ from the current package/module.",
  "sinks": "Passes __name__ as an argument to app(), which may influence program behavior but is benign.",
  "flows": "Imports __name__, then calls app(prog_name=__name__), passing the module name to the app function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, straightforward, and follows common CLI patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python CLI bootstrap script. It imports __name__ and an app function, then invokes app with __name__ as prog_name. No untrusted data, external inputs, or dynamic code execution are present. The use of __name__ in this context is standard and does not introduce security risks. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The minimal nature of the code and the absence of external interactions indicate no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no malicious intent or security issues. The passing of __name__ to app() is a common pattern and does not pose a security risk. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, though the security risk score in report 5 should be adjusted from 0.1 to 0 for accuracy.",
