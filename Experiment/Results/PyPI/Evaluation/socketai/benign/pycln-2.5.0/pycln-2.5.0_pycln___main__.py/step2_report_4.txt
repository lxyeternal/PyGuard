  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n```python\n\"\"\"Entry point to run Pycln as a module.\"\"\"\n\nfrom . import __name__\nfrom .cli import app\n\napp(prog_name=__name__)\n```\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n- The code is minimal and typical for a CLI entry point.\n- It imports `__name__` from the current package, then passes it to `app()` as `prog_name`.\n- No user input, environment variables, or external data are processed.\n- No apparent obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### Reports 1-4:\n- All describe the code as a standard CLI entry point.\n- No suspicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** These are accurate. The code is straightforward and secure.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- Similar to others but assigns a securityRisk score of 0.1, citing passing `__name__` as `prog_name` could \"potentially influence program behavior.\"\n- **Critical Evaluation:** Passing `__name__` (which is typically `'__main__'` or module name) to `app()` does not influence security or program behavior maliciously. It's a common pattern in CLI scripts.\n- The note about \"potential influence\" is overly cautious but not incorrect in a technical sense; however, it does not constitute a security risk.\n- **Recommendation:** The securityRisk score should remain at 0, as there's no actual security concern here.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking Scores:\n- All reports agree on no malware, no obfuscation, and no security risk.\n- The only point of contention is report 5's non-zero securityRisk score, which I believe is unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, as there's no security threat. The passing of `__name__` is standard practice and not risky.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Metric          | Final Score | Justification                                                 |\n|-----------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0            | No malicious code or behavior present                         |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            | Code is clear, minimal, and standard                          |\n| Security Risk   | 0            | No security issues; passing `__name__` is typical and safe    |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical CLI entry point with no security issues or malicious intent. The reports are accurate in their assessments, except for report 5's slight overestimation of risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Set securityRisk score to 0 for all reports, including report 5.\n\n**Overall Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk scores:**  \n**Malware: 0**  \n**Obfuscated: 0**  \n**Risk: 0**",
