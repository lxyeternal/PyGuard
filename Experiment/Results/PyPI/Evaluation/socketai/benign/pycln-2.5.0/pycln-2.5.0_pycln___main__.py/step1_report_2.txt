{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point to run the Pycln tool as a module, invoking its command-line interface.",
  "sources": "The code reads the special variable __name__ and imports 'app' from the 'cli' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "The flow is from reading __name__ to calling app(prog_name=__name__), which passes the module name to the CLI application.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present; the code appears straightforward and standard for CLI entry points.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __name__ and 'app' from a local module, then executes app with the program name. There is no indication of any malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The structure is typical for a CLI entry point, and no suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI entry point for the Pycln tool, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
