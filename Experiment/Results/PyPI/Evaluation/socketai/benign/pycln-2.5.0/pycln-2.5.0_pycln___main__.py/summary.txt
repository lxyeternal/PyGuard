  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no malicious intent or security issues. The passing of __name__ to app() is a common pattern and does not pose a security risk. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, though the security risk score in report 5 should be adjusted from 0.1 to 0 for accuracy."
