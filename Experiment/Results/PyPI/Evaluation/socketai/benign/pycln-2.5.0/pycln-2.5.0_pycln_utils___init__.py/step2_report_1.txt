  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple module with only a docstring, no executable code, variables, functions, or data handling.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity are detected.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating the reviewers are certain about the benign nature.\n- Malware scores are zero across all reports, which aligns with the minimal content.\n- Security risk scores are also zero, consistent with the absence of executable or sensitive code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code contains only a docstring with no executable content.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent; all assessments are consistent with the minimal code snippet.\n- **Scores evaluation:**\n  - Malware scores are appropriately set to 0, as there's no malicious code.\n  - Security risk scores are 0, matching the lack of security-sensitive operations.\n  - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n### Critical analysis:\n- Since the code is just a docstring, the likelihood of malicious activity is virtually nonexistent.\n- The reports correctly interpret the content as benign and placeholder-like.\n- No assumptions are made beyond the visible code snippet, and the reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Adjustments to scores:** None needed; all scores are appropriate.\n- **Potential for higher risk scores:** None justified, given the content.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** Confirmed to be 0.\n- **Risk scores:** Correctly 0, reflecting no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The code is harmless, likely a placeholder or documentation stub.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No further action required.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, minimal nature of the provided code snippet.\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate and consistent with the content. The code poses no security threat, and the scores are appropriate.",
