  "purpose": "This code serves as a module-level docstring describing 'Pycln utils module', with no executable code or data handling.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only a docstring and no input or data reading points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; there are no data flows, untrusted inputs, or outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is purely a descriptive comment with no execution or data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, variables, functions, or data handling; only a docstring present, which is normal for a placeholder or documentation stub.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely a docstring with no executable content, data flows, or suspicious patterns. All reviews correctly identify this minimal content as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. Confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty about the benign nature. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected or suspected. The content aligns with a placeholder or documentation stub, posing no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal module description with no executable or suspicious elements. All reports accurately assess this, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
