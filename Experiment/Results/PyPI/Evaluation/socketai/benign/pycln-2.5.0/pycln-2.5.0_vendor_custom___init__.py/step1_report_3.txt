  "sinks": "N/A (no untrusted data handling or output operations shown)",
  "flows": "N/A (no code logic or data flow demonstrated)",
  "anomalies": "Modification of stdlib modules can be suspicious if not justified; lacks specific details, and such modifications may introduce malicious behavior or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The description indicates that the module contains altered versions of standard library modules. Without the actual code, it's impossible to determine the nature of modifications—whether benign, malicious, or for compatibility. Modified stdlib modules can be used for malicious purposes such as data interception, privilege escalation, or hiding malicious behavior. The absence of code details prevents a definitive assessment, but the context alone raises concern about potential tampering or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the description, the module involves modified standard library modules, which is suspicious and potentially malicious, depending on the nature of the modifications. Further code review is necessary to confirm the intent and safety.",
