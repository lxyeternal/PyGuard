  "flows": "N/A (no code execution or data flow observable)",
  "anomalies": "Modification of standard library modules could indicate potential malicious intent, such as inserting backdoors or malicious behavior into core functionalities.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is only a comment indicating that the module contains modified versions of standard library modules. Without actual code, there is no detailed analysis possible. However, replacing or modifying standard modules can be a security risk if the modifications introduce malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The absence of code prevents confirmation of such activities, but the intent implied by modification warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself does not show malicious behavior but suggests potential risk due to modifications of core modules. This pattern is suspicious and could be used to introduce malicious functionalities. Further review of the actual modified modules is necessary.",
