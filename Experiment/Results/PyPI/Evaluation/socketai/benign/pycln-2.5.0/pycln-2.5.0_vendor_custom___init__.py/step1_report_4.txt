{
  "purpose": "Contains modified versions of standard library modules.",
  "sources": "Potentially modified stdlib modules loaded or imported within the code.",
  "sinks": "Any use of the modified modules that could execute malicious code or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Import or override of standard modules -> use of functions from these modules -> execution of potentially malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The description indicates modifications to stdlib modules, which could be used to introduce malicious behavior or covert functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to include or override standard library modules with modified versions. Such modifications can be exploited to include malicious code, hide malicious behavior, or manipulate data silently. Since the code snippet does not show the actual content of the modified modules or the import statements, it's uncertain whether these modifications are benign or malicious. This practice is suspicious because it can conceal malicious intent or backdoors. No actual code is provided, but the described approach is a common tactic for malicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The presence of modified standard library modules is suspicious and could indicate malicious intent, such as hiding backdoors or malicious functions. Without further details, the risk remains high, and this pattern warrants caution.",
