  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and utility functions for handling file-related errors and parsing issues in a Python project.",
  "sources": "None (the code does not read input or data from external sources).",
  "sinks": "None (the code does not process or write untrusted data).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from source to sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code follows standard exception handling patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes for file and parsing errors, with detailed message formatting that includes file paths and locations. It uses standard Python exception practices, with no network operations, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic detected. Functions like 'libcst_parser_syntax_error_message' simply reformat error messages and do not perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility module defining exception classes and error message formatting functions for internal use. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a standard, safe component of a larger codebase.",
