{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and utility functions for error handling in a Python project, specifically related to file operations and parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include file paths, NodeLocation objects, and error objects such as SyntaxError, IndentationError, ValueError, and custom error messages.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve raising exceptions with detailed messages that include file paths, line and column numbers, and error details. These are used for debugging and user feedback.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading input data (file paths, error objects) into exception constructors, formatting messages that include this data, and then raising exceptions or returning messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or malicious code are observed. The code strictly handles exception messaging and error class definitions without external data transmission or system modification.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception classes and utility functions to handle specific error scenarios related to file operations and parsing. It includes detailed message formatting for debugging purposes, with no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or malicious behaviors. All data used in messages are sourced from controlled inputs such as file paths and error objects, with no external or untrusted data sources present. There are no indications of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution. The use of exception classes appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard error handling utility module for a Python project, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It focuses on safe exception reporting and does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or system modifications.",
