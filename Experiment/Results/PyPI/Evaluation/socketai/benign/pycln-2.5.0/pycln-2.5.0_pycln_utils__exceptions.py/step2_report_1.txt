  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code defines custom exception classes and utility functions primarily for error handling related to file operations and parsing.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and free from malicious behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or data exfiltration are present.\n- Exception messages include file paths, line numbers, and error details, which is typical for debugging but could leak sensitive info if misused—though this is not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- It does **not** perform network operations, data transmission, or code execution.\n- The logic is consistent with standard exception handling practices.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n### Issues or Flaws:\n- The code appears clean, with no logical errors or security flaws.\n- Exception message formatting is detailed but standard; no vulnerabilities are introduced here.\n- No external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed in a harmful way.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (around 0.1), which makes sense because the code is purely for error reporting and does not pose security risks.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The **risk score** could be slightly higher if exception messages leak sensitive info, but since the code only formats and raises exceptions with provided data, and there's no evidence of sensitive data handling or external communication, a low score is justified.\n- The **malware score** remains at 0 because there's no malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** remains at 0 as the code is transparent.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The code is safe, standard, and does not introduce supply chain risks.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted; the code's purpose is clear and benign.\n- The detailed error messages, while potentially exposing info, are typical for debugging and do not constitute a security flaw in this context.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nBased on all reports and the code review, I would assign the following scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very minimal, just standard error handling, no real security concern)\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, safe utility module for exception handling.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- The supply chain security risk is negligible.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that in production environments, exception messages do not leak sensitive info like file paths or error details, but this is a best practice rather than a flaw in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis above.",
