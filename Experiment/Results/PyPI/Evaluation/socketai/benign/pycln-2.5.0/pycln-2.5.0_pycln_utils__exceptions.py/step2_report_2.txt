  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, potential security implications, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines custom exception classes and utility functions for error handling related to file operations and parsing.\n- All data involved in exception messages come from controlled inputs: file paths, error objects, and node locations.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, code execution, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code is straightforward, with standard patterns for exception handling and message formatting.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** No malicious behavior; standard exception classes and message formatting.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score aligns with the benign nature. The confidence is high, given the code's simplicity.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1; standard error handling, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Justification:** No security concerns; the score is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same conclusion; exception classes with message formatting.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.95.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk score (0.1) for potential information leakage via error messages, but this is standard practice and not malicious.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Clear, straightforward utility code with no external data sources or harmful operations.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Justification:** No security issues; scores align.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous; exception classes and message formatting.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malware:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; mainly informational/error reporting code.\n- **Scores assigned:** Consistent with the analysis; minor risk scores for message leakage are justified but not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Should stay low, around 0.0 to 0.1, since the code is purely for error handling and does not perform any risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a standard utility module for exception handling with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (to reflect minimal concern about potential information leakage, but overall very safe)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
