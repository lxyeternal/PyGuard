  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is standard exception classes and utility functions for error reporting. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data leaks. The confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0, and security risk is minimal (0.1).\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, focused on exception handling, with no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code defines custom exceptions and message formatting. No suspicious behaviors or malicious intent. Confidence is perfect (1.0), malware score is 0, and security risk is negligible.\n- **Assessment:** Safe, standard error handling code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, the code is straightforward exception classes and message formatting. No malicious activities or data leaks. Slightly higher confidence (0.95), malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** No evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** The code is purely exception class definitions and message formatting functions. No external data processing or malicious actions. Confidence is 1.0, malware 0, risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Benign utility code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar pattern—exception classes, message formatting, no malicious activity. Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe the same pattern: defining custom exceptions and utility functions for error handling related to file operations and parsing.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All scores are zero, indicating no malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, as the code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** The only minor concern is that error messages include file paths and error details, which could leak sensitive info if misused, but this is standard in debugging contexts.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code is consistent across reports, and all evidence points to a benign utility module.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 or 0) are appropriate.\n- No changes needed; the security posture appears safe.\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, standard error reporting, acceptable in context)\n\nThis code is a safe, standard utility for exception handling with no security concerns.",
