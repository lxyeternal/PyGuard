{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and utility functions for error handling related to file operations and parsing, providing structured error messages for debugging.",
  "sources": "File paths, NodeLocation objects, error instances (SyntaxError, IndentationError, ValueError).",
  "sinks": "Error messages formatted with file paths, line numbers, and error details; potential for info leakage if misused, but standard for debugging.",
  "flows": "Source data (file paths, error objects, node locations) are formatted into exception messages; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; exception message formatting is standard; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of exception classes and message formatting functions for error reporting. It uses controlled inputs and standard practices, with no malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscation. The detailed messages could leak sensitive info but are typical for debugging purposes. The code's logic is straightforward, and no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for exception handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the context. Overall, the supply chain security risk is negligible.",
