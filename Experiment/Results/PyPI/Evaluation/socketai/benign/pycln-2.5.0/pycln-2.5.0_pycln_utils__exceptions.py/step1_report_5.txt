{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and utility functions for handling errors related to file operations, parsing, and import issues within the Pycln project.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include file paths, error objects (syntax, indentation, value errors), and node location data.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily raises exceptions with formatted messages; it does not contain sinks that execute untrusted data or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Input data (file paths, error objects, node locations) flows into exception message construction and exception raising, but there are no external calls or data transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, primarily exception handling and message formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various custom exceptions for file and parsing errors, with detailed message formatting based on input parameters. It includes a utility for refactoring syntax error messages from the LibCST parser. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a standard error handling utility module without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign utility module focused on error handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It does not contain any malicious payloads or suspicious activities.",
