  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines custom exceptions and utilities for error handling, sourcing data from file paths, NodeLocation objects, and error instances.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The code is standard exception handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low, as it's just error reporting). The confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on error handling with file paths and exceptions.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent, straightforward error classes and message formatting.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. No security concerns. Confidence is even higher (1).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines exception classes, including a function to format syntax error messages.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, only message formatting. Potential minor concern is that error messages include file paths and error details, which could leak info but are standard for debugging.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (due to potential info leakage, but not malicious). Confidence is high (0.95).\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, defining exception classes and formatting functions.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity or malicious code. It's a standard utility module.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. No security concern. Confidence = 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Exception classes and error message formatting.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, straightforward exception handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Confidence = 1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity, which aligns with the code's nature as a utility module for exception handling.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious hiding.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), justified by the fact that error messages include file paths and error details, which could leak sensitive info if misused. However, this is standard for debugging and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, related to information leakage, not malicious activity.\n\n**Note:** The code is a standard error handling utility with no supply chain security threats or malware indicators. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, but the risk score should remain low, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, with no malicious intent.\n- No obfuscation or malware detected.\n- Slight risk due to potential info leakage, but this is standard and not a security threat.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
