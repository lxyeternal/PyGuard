{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and utility functions for handling errors related to file operations, parsing, and import handling within a Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from file paths, exception objects, and error messages.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages and error details could potentially be exposed, but no untrusted data is directly used in critical operations such as network communication or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised with messages containing file paths, line numbers, and error texts, based on caught errors during file operations or parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behaviors, backdoors, or covert data leaks are present. The code strictly handles exceptions and error messaging without involving external data transmission or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily focused on defining custom exception classes for error handling and formatting error messages for parsing and file access issues. It does not perform any operations involving user input, network, or environment variables that could be exploited maliciously. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs are present. The functions and classes are straightforward and serve standard error handling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard utility module for exception handling within a larger application. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code's structure and functionality are consistent with safe practices for error reporting.",
