  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for analyzing Python source code's AST, including extracting import statements, detecting side effects, and handling string annotations.",
  "sources": "Reading source code from strings, reading file content, accessing attributes of AST nodes (e.g., node targets, names, annotations), and module file paths.",
  "sinks": "Parsing string literals into ASTs, expanding import star statements, and reading file content via 'iou.safe_read' which could potentially process untrusted source files.",
  "flows": "Source code is read and parsed into AST; string literals are parsed into AST to extract identifiers; import star expansion reads file content; importable names are extracted; side effects are analyzed based on imports and function calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'ast.parse' with type comments and string annotations, which are typical for type hinting and not suspicious; 'expand_import_star' reads external files using 'iou.safe_read', which could process untrusted files; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present; no use of insecure functions or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on AST analysis, import collection, and side effect detection. It uses standard Python features and careful handling of AST nodes, including compatibility with different Python versions. The use of external file reading ('iou.safe_read') to expand 'import *' could be a vector if the source files are malicious or compromised, but this is a necessary operation for static analysis and is controlled within the code. No malicious payloads, network communication, or data exfiltration routines are present. The code appears to be a legitimate static analysis utility for Python source code, with no signs of malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static analysis utility for Python source files that parses and analyzes ASTs to extract import information, detect side effects, and handle string annotations. It does perform file reading to expand import star statements, which could be a concern if the source files are malicious, but this is part of its normal operation. No malware or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears safe and purposeful within its scope.",
