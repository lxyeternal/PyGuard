{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility classes and functions for analyzing Python source code's AST, focusing on extracting import statements, source code identifiers, and assessing side effects for static analysis or code linting.",
  "sources": "Reading source code as string lines (in constructor of SourceAnalyzer), parsing source code via ast.parse, visiting AST nodes such as ast.Import, ast.ImportFrom, ast.Name, ast.Attribute, and various code constructs.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present. No data is written to external systems, network, or system files. No execution or eval-like functions are called with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Source code is read and parsed into an AST; data flows through AST visitor methods extracting import names, identifiers, and annotations; no untrusted data directly influences system or external components.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code correctly manages source parsing, handles exceptions, and performs static analysis tasks. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static analysis utility focusing on parsing Python code AST, extracting import statements, identifiers, and potential side effects. It uses well-defined visitors with recursion decorators, manages Python version differences, and includes functions for expanding star imports and parsing string annotations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or reverse shells are evident. It primarily reads and analyzes code structure for purposes like linting or dependency analysis.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard static analysis utility module for Python code. It contains no malicious or sabotage code, hardcoded secrets, or harmful behaviors. Its purpose is to analyze code structure safely and efficiently. No security threats or malware indicators are present.",
