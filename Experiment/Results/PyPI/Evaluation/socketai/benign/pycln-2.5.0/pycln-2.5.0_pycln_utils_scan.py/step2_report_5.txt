  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential security implications, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a static analysis utility with no malicious intent, emphasizing safe handling of import star expansion via exception handling, and no evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - The code performs static parsing and analysis, including expanding import stars with safeguards.  \n  - The only potential concern is the dynamic reading of external files during import star expansion, but this is a controlled, well-encapsulated operation with error handling.  \n  - No execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present.  \n  - The malware score is rightly set to 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Score suggestion:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 (accurate)  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (accurate)  \n  - **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to file reading, which is necessary for static analysis)\n\n**Verdict:** The report's scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the utility's purpose, noting that it reads source code and parses ASTs to extract import info, with no external communication or malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - The main potential risk is the import star expansion, which involves reading external files.  \n  - However, this operation is controlled and with error handling, and no malicious payloads are evident.  \n  - The code does not execute code or perform network operations.\n\n- **Score suggestion:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 (appropriate)  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0 (no significant security risk, just the inherent risk in reading external files, which is necessary for static analysis)\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizing static analysis, file reading for import expansion, and no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - The only noteworthy operation is reading external files during import star expansion, which could be exploited if files are malicious.  \n  - But within the context of static analysis, this is standard and controlled.\n\n- **Score suggestion:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0.2 (slightly higher due to potential misuse if source files are malicious, but still low)\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the same points: static analysis, import expansion, no malicious behavior, with potential concern about reading external files.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - The operation is necessary for complete dependency analysis, and error handling mitigates risks.  \n  - No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Score suggestion:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with previous)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the utility's static analysis purpose, with no malicious activity, and safe handling of source code.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - No execution or unsafe operations.  \n  - The only operation that could be risky is reading external files during import star expansion, but it is a controlled, necessary part of static analysis.\n\n- **Score suggestion:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to file reads)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are correctly set to 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the potential risk in reading external files during import star expansion, which is a necessary part of static analysis but could be misused if source files are malicious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0.1 - 0.2** (consistent with reports)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified based on the code's behavior. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are present. The only inherent risk stems from reading external files during import star expansion, which is a known and controlled aspect of static analysis tools.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nThe current scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed. The code is a safe, well-structured static analysis utility with minimal security concerns.",
