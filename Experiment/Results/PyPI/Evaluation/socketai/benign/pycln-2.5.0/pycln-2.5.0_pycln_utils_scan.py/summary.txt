  "conclusion": "The source code is a safe, well-structured static analysis utility with no signs of sabotage, malware, or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the reading of external files during import star expansion, which could be exploited if source files are malicious, but this is a known and controlled aspect of static analysis. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the overall security posture is sound."
