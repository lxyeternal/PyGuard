  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step to identify any potential security concerns, inconsistencies, or signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Reports:\n- All reports describe the code as a static analysis utility for Python AST, focusing on import statements, source identifiers, side effects, and import star expansion.\n- They consistently highlight that the code reads source files, parses ASTs, and performs static analysis without executing code.\n- The only operation that could potentially be a vector for malicious activity is the `expand_import_star` function, which reads external files via `iou.safe_read` to resolve star imports.\n- No report indicates evidence of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly ≥ 0.9), and malware scores are consistently 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Observations:\n- **Code Behavior:** Static analysis, AST parsing, import collection, side effect detection.\n- **Potential Risks:** The import star expansion reads external files, which could be malicious if source files are compromised.\n- **Safeguards:** Exception handling in `expand_import_star` prevents unhandled errors; it logs errors and raises `UnexpandableImportStar` if needed.\n- **No dynamic code execution:** No `eval`, `exec`, or similar functions.\n- **No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets** detected.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware or sabotage:** No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or code injection.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard Python features.\n- **Import star expansion:** While potentially risky if source files are malicious, the code handles errors gracefully and does not execute untrusted code.\n- **Data flow:** Internal, static, with no external network or system modification.\n\n### Justification of Malware Score:\n- The malware score is **0** across all reports, which is justified given the static nature of the code and absence of malicious payloads.\n- The only concern is the `expand_import_star` function, but it is a controlled operation with exception handling, not executing untrusted code directly, just reading and analyzing files.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n- The small security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects the potential risk of reading external files, but this is inherent to static analysis tools and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Based on the reports and the code:**\n\n| Metric            | Suggested Score |\n|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware           | **0** (no malicious behavior) |\n| Obfuscated        | **0** (clear code) |\n| Risk              | **0.1-0.2** (potentially reading untrusted files, but controlled) |\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, intended for static code analysis, with no signs of malicious intent.**\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided code is a legitimate static analysis utility for Python source code, with careful error handling and no evidence of malicious behavior. The potential risk from import star expansion is inherent to such tools but is managed properly within the code. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security posture is sound.",
