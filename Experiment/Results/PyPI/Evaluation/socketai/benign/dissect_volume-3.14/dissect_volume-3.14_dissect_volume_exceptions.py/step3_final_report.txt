  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for error handling related to disk and RAID operations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Error and Exception; no external data inputs or outputs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely class declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution logic; static class hierarchy.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of multiple empty class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from a base Error class, which itself inherits from Python's Exception. There are no data inputs, outputs, dynamic behaviors, or external interactions. The code is standard for defining exception hierarchies and does not contain any suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present, and the code poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. The reports accurately reflect this, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
