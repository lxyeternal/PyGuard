  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for various storage and device management errors.",
  "sources": "No input data or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or output in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling without any unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of custom exception classes, all inheriting from a base Error class. Each class is an empty subclass, serving as specific exception identifiers. There are no operations, data processing, or external interactions. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscation present. The structure is typical for organizing exceptions in a Python project related to device or storage management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining custom exceptions without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
