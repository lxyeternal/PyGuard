  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various disk and device management errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data output, storage, or untrusted data handling occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; this code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of class definitions with inheritance from Exception.",
  "analysis": "The code declares multiple custom exception classes that inherit from a base Error class, which itself inherits from Python's built-in Exception. These classes are simple pass-through subclasses intended to categorize different types of errors. There are no data inputs, outputs, or execution logic. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code is straightforward and serves as a structured exception hierarchy.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only class definitions for custom exceptions and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
