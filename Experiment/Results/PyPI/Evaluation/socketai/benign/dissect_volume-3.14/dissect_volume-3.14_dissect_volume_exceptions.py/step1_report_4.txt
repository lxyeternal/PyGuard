{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various hardware or storage-related errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions do not include data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; class declarations are static and do not involve data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code consists solely of standard exception class definitions with no unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base Error class. These classes are empty and serve as placeholders for specific error types related to storage or hardware issues. There are no functions, data processing, or control flow that could be exploited. The code is straightforward and follows typical Python practices for custom exceptions. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
