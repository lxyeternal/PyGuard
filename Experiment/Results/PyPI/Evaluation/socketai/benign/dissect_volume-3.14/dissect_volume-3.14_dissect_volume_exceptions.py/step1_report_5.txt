  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error types related to disk and storage management.",
  "sources": "No data input sources or external data reads; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only establishes class inheritance structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from a base Error class. No functions, data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The classes serve as custom exceptions for specific error types related to disk or storage systems. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears to be standard and benign, serving as part of a larger exception handling framework.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It poses no threat and is typical for error handling in Python applications.",
