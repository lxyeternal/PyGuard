  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various disk and device management errors",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading involved; only class definitions",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data output points present",
  "flows": "No data flows, input/output, or data processing occurring",
  "anomalies": "Simple class inheritance for exception handling; no unusual code or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple class definitions that inherit from a base Error class, which itself inherits from Python's Exception. Each class serves as a specific exception type for disk or device management errors. There are no data inputs, no dynamic execution, and no code that interacts with external systems, files, or network resources. The code appears straightforward and purely structural, with no malicious behavior or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a benign, well-structured code fragment intended for use in larger applications.",
