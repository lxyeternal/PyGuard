  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only consists of class definitions inheriting from `Error`, which itself inherits from `Exception`.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, or execution logic, and no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and purely structural, serving as a custom exception hierarchy.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1.0\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No adjustments needed; the scores align well with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports confidently conclude that the code is harmless, no risk scores above 0.5 are justified.\n   - **Conclusion:** The current risk scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as simple class definitions.\n   - No overreach or speculative claims are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analyses.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\nGiven the comprehensive and accurate analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and poses no security risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0       | No malicious activity or code patterns present             |\n| Obfuscated       | 0       | Code is straightforward class definitions, no obfuscation  |\n| Security Risk    | 0       | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious intent       |\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and poses no security concerns.",
