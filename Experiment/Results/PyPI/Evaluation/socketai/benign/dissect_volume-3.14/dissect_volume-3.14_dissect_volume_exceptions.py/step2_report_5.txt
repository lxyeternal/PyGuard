  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the original code.\n\n**1. Confirmed Issues in the Code:**\n- The original code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base Error class, which itself inherits from Python's built-in Exception.\n- All classes are empty and only serve as distinct exception types.\n- No data input/output, external interactions, or execution logic is present.\n\n**2. Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports consistently state that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- They correctly identify that the code is purely structural, serving as an exception hierarchy.\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning; the assessments are accurate.\n\n**3. Scores and Justification:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The confidence scores are 1.0, which is reasonable given the straightforwardness of the code.\n- No adjustments needed; the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**4. Risk Scores and Their Justification:**\n- Since the code only defines exception classes with no dynamic or external behavior, the overall risk is negligible.\n- The reports' `securityRisk: 0` and `malware: 0` are justified.\n- The `obfuscated: 0` is correct, as there's no obfuscation present.\n\n**5. Potential Assumptions and Claims:**\n- All reports avoid assumptions about malicious intent; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are made, which is appropriate.\n\n**6. Overall Consistency:**\n- The scores and analysis are consistent across reports.\n- The conclusion that this code is safe and non-malicious is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely structural, defining custom exception classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports correctly reflect this, and no further scrutiny suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign exception hierarchy with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
