  "purpose": "Define and load disk label and metadata structures for parsing disk-related data.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded structure definitions and string constants within the code.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only sets up data structures and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code primarily defines data structures and constants without any dynamic or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature for annotations and uses a library 'dissect.cstruct' to load a string defining several C-like data structures related to disk labels and metadata. It then defines several constants for sector size and status flags as string literals. No functions, dynamic code execution, or data processing logic is present. The structures appear to be for parsing disk metadata, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or suspicious behavior. The constants are typical and do not indicate malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup of data structures for disk metadata parsing, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger tool or library focused on disk management or analysis.",
