{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for LVM (Logical Volume Manager) metadata parsing using cstruct.",
  "sources": "Static string 'lvm_def' containing structure definitions; import statements.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks, as there is no data input or external communication in the provided code.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only defines data structures and constants, no data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward structure definitions without unusual code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for type hints, imports 'cstruct' for parsing binary data, and defines various structure layouts as a string. These are standard for binary parsing of LVM metadata. No user input, environment variables, or network interactions are present. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The constants are straightforward flags related to LVM metadata and do not exhibit malicious intent. The use of 'cstruct' for parsing binary data is typical in such contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines data structures and constants for parsing LVM metadata. It does not perform any data input/output, network communication, or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and intended for legitimate binary parsing purposes.",
