{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures related to LVM (Logical Volume Manager) metadata and loads them using cstruct for further processing.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines static data structures and constants; no input or external data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks, network operations, or data manipulation based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "None; the code is purely declarative, defining data structures and constants without any runtime data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, defining binary structures for metadata and constants. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations and a cstruct library, then defines several C-style structs as string literals. It loads these into a cstruct object, presumably for parsing binary data elsewhere. Constants related to sector size and status flags are defined. There are no data inputs, no network operations, and no dynamic code execution. No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors is observed. The code is standard for metadata handling within a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is purely definitional, establishing data structures and constants for disk/metadata management. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and benign.",
