  "purpose": "Define and load structures related to disk and metadata headers for LVM (Logical Volume Manager) operations.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code only defines constants and structures.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; no functions or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely establishes static structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The use of constant definitions and structure parsing appears standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations and a structure parsing library, then defines several C-like structure formats related to disk metadata. It then loads these definitions into a cstruct object. Constants related to sector size and status flags are also set. There are no input sources, no data sinks, and no executable code, functions, or external interactions. The code appears to serve as a static schema or parser setup for disk/metadata structures, which is typical in disk management or low-level system utilities. No suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard definition of disk and metadata structures used for parsing or managing disk information. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. It appears to be a safe, static setup for further disk-related processing.",
