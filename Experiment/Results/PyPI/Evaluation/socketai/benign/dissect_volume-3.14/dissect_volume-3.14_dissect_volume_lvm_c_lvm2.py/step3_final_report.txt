{
  "purpose": "Defines static data structures and constants for disk label and LVM metadata parsing.",
  "sources": "Static string containing C-like structure definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; purely static definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static structure definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code only loads static structure definitions into a cstruct object, with no dynamic code, input/output, or network activity. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The constants and structure definitions are typical for disk and metadata parsing. The code's purpose appears to be for low-level disk management or parsing utilities. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident, and the code's static nature confirms its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, benign setup for parsing disk/metadata structures with no malicious or security concerns. All evidence supports a safe, non-malicious assessment.",
