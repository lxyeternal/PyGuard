{
  "purpose": "Defines structures and constants related to LVM disk labels and metadata parsing using a cstruct loader.",
  "sources": "Static string containing structure definitions and constant declarations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no input/output operations are implemented.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for type hints, uses 'dissect.cstruct' to load static C-like structure definitions into Python, and defines some constants related to disk sectors and status flags. There are no input or output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no network interactions. The structure definitions are standard for disk/metadata management and contain no indications of malicious intent. The overall code appears to be a straightforward, static data structure definition module with no apparent security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module for defining disk and metadata structures with no malicious intent or security risks. It is purely static data definition without any suspicious or harmful components.",
