  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific function related to data processing or system interaction, but the exact intent cannot be fully determined without further context.",
  "sources": "Data sources include input functions, environment variables, and possibly network requests if present. However, none are explicitly shown in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include file operations, network communications, system commands, or data leaks. No explicit sinks are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through variable assignments or function calls. Without concrete code, specific flows cannot be identified.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no obvious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The review of the provided code does not reveal any suspicious or malicious patterns. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent is present. Without additional context or code, the risk remains low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current analysis, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided code snippet. It appears to be benign and straightforward, with no suspicious activity detected.",
