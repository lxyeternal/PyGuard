  "purpose": "Analysis of Python code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code reading environment variables, importing modules, dynamic execution functions like 'eval'/'exec', hardcoded secrets, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, system modifications, network communications, dynamic code execution, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as obfuscated code or dynamic eval() leading to potential malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation score (0.7) in Report 2, use of 'eval'/'exec', dynamic code execution, inconsistent malware scores relative to obfuscation severity.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign in most reports, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. Report 2 indicates obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion. The malware score in Report 2 (0.3) is somewhat conservative; given the high obfuscation (0.7), increasing it to 0.5 would better reflect potential risk. Other reports show no obfuscation or malicious activity, with scores aligned accordingly. The security risk scores are low (0.2), appropriate for the context. Overall, the assessments are consistent, with the primary concern in Report 2 due to obfuscation and dynamic features.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign, with a notable suspicion in Report 2 due to obfuscation and dynamic execution. Adjusting the malware score for Report 2 to 0.5 improves risk representation. The overall security posture remains low, with scores reflecting cautious suspicion where warranted.",
