  "purpose": "This code module imports specific classes related to LVM management and re-exports them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from dissect.volume.lvm.lvm2 and dissect.volume.lvm.physical modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static import statements only",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static import and export only",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes LVM2 and LVM2Device and exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. The code is static, clear, and aligns with legitimate storage management functionality. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.0-0.1), justified by the module's role but not indicating any actual risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. The current scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly scored as 0, and the security risk is very low. No further action needed.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
