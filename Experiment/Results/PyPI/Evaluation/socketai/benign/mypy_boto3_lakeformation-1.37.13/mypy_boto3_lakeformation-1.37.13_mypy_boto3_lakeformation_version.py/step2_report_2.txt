  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the code in question.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.13\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, external inputs, or outputs.\n- No obfuscation, no hidden code, no malicious constructs.\n- The code is a standard pattern used in Python packages for versioning.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign and serves as a version identifier.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version assignment.\n- They note the absence of data flows, external inputs, or suspicious patterns.\n- The confidence scores are 1.0, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity.\n- The obfuscated, malware, and securityRisk scores are all 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Potential issues in reasoning:**\n- None of the reports suggest any hidden or malicious intent, which is accurate.\n- They do not overstate the security implications; the assessments are conservative and correct.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — No malicious activity, no code injection, no obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — No security risk; it's a static version string.\n\n**Any higher scores would be unjustified** given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code is a typical, benign version declaration.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed in the scoring or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the code's nature as a simple, static version string assignment with no security concerns.",
