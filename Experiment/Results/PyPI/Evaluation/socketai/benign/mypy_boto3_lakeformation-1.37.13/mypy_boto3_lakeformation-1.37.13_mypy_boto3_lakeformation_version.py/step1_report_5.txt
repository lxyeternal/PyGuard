  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module as a string variable.",
  "sources": "The code reads a static string for the version number '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward version assignment with a comment and copyright notice.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment, a copyright notice, and a single variable assignment of the version string. There are no dynamic behaviors, no input reading, no network calls, or suspicious code constructs. It appears to be a typical version declaration used in Python packages. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
