  "purpose": "Define the version of the package using a static string assignment.",
  "sources": "No external sources; static assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external output.",
  "flows": "None; the code only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version string assignment with a comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string to __version__, with no input, output, or dynamic behavior. It contains only a comment and a copyright notice. There are no obfuscation techniques, malicious code, or suspicious constructs. The code serves as metadata for versioning purposes. Given its simplicity, there are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation present. All signals indicate benign intent. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. All signals confirm its safety, and the scores are consistent with its straightforward nature.",
