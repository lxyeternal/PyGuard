  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze their conclusions, the scores assigned, and whether they are justified.\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no input sources, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for version declaration in Python packages.\n   - No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Security and Malware Scores**:\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0.0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are also 0.0, consistent with the absence of any vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0.0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n3. **Scores Justification**:\n   - The high confidence (1.0) across all reports is justified, as the code is unambiguous and standard.\n   - The reasoning in each report is sound and aligns with best practices.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws**:\n   - No issues are evident; all reports agree that this is benign code.\n   - The logic and conclusions are consistent and reasonable.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation**:\n   - The code is a simple version string assignment with no security concerns.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0.0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score**: 0.0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's actual content.\n\n**Summary**:\nAll reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
