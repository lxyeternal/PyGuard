  "purpose": "Define the version string for the package or module.",

  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of the version string with an associated copyright comment. There are no dynamic or external inputs, no functions, no network calls, or data processing. It appears to be a standard version declaration common in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, with no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation. It is a typical version assignment statement.",
