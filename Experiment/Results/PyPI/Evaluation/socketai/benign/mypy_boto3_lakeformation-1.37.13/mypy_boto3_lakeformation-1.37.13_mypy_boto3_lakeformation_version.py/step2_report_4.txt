  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the underlying code.\n\n**Code Analysis Summary:**\n- The code only assigns a static string to the `__version__` variable.\n- There are no functions, data flows, external inputs, network calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains only metadata.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple version declaration with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly interpret the code as benign and standard.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. There is no malicious activity.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, aligning with the code's benign nature.\n\n### Score Reasonableness:\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports avoid assumptions and correctly interpret the code as a standard version declaration.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The code is a straightforward, benign version string declaration with no security implications. No further action or concern is warranted.",
