  "analysis": "The code is minimal, setting a version string. No external input, no data processing, no suspicious constructs. The comment indicates copyright info for 2025, but this does not affect security. There are no embedded code injection, data leaks, or malicious instructions. It appears to be a standard version declaration file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a version identifier with no malicious intent or security risks.",
