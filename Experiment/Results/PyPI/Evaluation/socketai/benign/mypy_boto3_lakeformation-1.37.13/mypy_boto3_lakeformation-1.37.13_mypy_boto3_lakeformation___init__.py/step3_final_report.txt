{
  "purpose": "Module providing interface to AWS LakeFormation SDK components, including documentation and class exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), static docstring, metadata",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data flows present",
  "flows": "None; static imports and exports only",
  "anomalies": "Unusual copyright year 2025 noted in documentation, but no malicious or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface module with static imports, class aliasing, and documentation. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or data processing is present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. The only anomaly is the future copyright date, which does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK wrapper code with no malicious or security concerns. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in one report is justified solely by the unusual date but does not indicate malicious intent.",
