  "purpose": "CLI utility for displaying package information and version details",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for printing information to the console",
  "flows": "Command-line input (--version) triggers print_version, otherwise print_info",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed; code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and defines functions to output static package info and version. The main function checks for a '--version' argument and accordingly calls print_version or print_info. There are no external data inputs beyond command-line arguments and no external network or file operations, nor dynamic code execution. The code appears to be a simple CLI tool intended for informational display. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility with no malicious intent or security issues. It solely outputs static information based on user input, with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior.",
