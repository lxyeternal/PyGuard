  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Behavior:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI script that outputs static package info or version based on the presence of `--version` in `sys.argv`.\n   - It imports only `sys`, uses straightforward functions, and does not process untrusted input beyond argument checking.\n   - No external network calls, dynamic code execution, or data handling is present.\n   - The output is static and hardcoded, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code is clean, simple, and standard for such CLI tools.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n   - The reports uniformly agree on benignity, with confidence scores of 1.0 and no obfuscation or malware.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code only outputs static information and does not process untrusted input beyond a simple argument check, there are no vulnerabilities or attack vectors.\n   - The code does not contain any backdoors, secrets, or suspicious logic.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, benign CLI utility.\n   - The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n   - No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain at 0.\n\n### My Personal Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is entirely benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and no further action is needed.",
