  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The script is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on a command-line argument.\n   - It imports `sys`, checks for `--version` in `sys.argv`, and writes to `stdout`.\n   - No external network calls, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted data.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated/malicious code.\n\n2. **Security & Maliciousness:**\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n   - No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious intent detected.\n   - The code is straightforward and serves a simple informational purpose.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's benign nature.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n   - **Confidence Level:** 1.0, reflecting high certainty based on the straightforward code.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No reason to adjust scores; the code is clearly safe.\n   - The only minor note is that some reports explicitly mention \"no obfuscation\" or \"no suspicious code,\" which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment & My Own Estimate:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n   - **Risk Score:** 0\n   - **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a simple, benign CLI script with no malicious or security issues. The reports are accurate and comprehensive. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n- Maintain high confidence.\n- The code poses no security threat.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Obfuscated Score: 0\n- Risk Score: 0\n- Confidence: 1.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
