{
  "purpose": "This script functions as a CLI entrypoint to display package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 LakeFormation stubs.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, and outputs information through sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to standard output (stdout). No untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "Checks if '--version' is present in sys.argv; if so, calls print_version(), otherwise calls print_info().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and contains no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to handle command-line arguments and output. It provides two functions for displaying package info and version. The main() function controls the flow based on command-line input. The script only outputs static text and does not process untrusted input in a risky manner. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information and version. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and poses no security risks.",
