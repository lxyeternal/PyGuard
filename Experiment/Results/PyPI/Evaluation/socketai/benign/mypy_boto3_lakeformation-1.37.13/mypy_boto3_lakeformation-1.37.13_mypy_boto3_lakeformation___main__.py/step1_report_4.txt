{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI entrypoint that provides package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 LakeFormation stubs.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv, outputs information via sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout via sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is present in command-line arguments, calls print_version() and outputs version info; otherwise, calls print_info() to display package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code structures. The license notice is straightforward and contains no suspicious content. No use of dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily processes command-line input to display static package information and version data. It reads sys.argv to detect a specific argument and writes output accordingly. The code is simple, with no external data sources, no user input beyond command-line args, and no sensitive data handling. There are no suspicious code patterns, malicious calls, or obfuscated elements present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI script for displaying package info and version details. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The overall structure and content are benign and consistent with typical CLI entrypoints.",
