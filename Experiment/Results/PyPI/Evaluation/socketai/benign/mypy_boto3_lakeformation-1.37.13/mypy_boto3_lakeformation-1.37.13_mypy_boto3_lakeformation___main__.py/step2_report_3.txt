  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation**:\n   - The code is a minimal CLI script that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted input beyond argument checking.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, no secrets, and no malicious logic.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - None of the reports suggest any behavior that would warrant a higher risk score.\n   - The code is purely informational, with no external dependencies or dynamic behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions such as executing external code, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly interpret the code's static and benign nature.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are evident.\n\n**Overall Summary & Personal Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — The code is non-malicious.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Final Justification**:\nThe code is a simple CLI utility that displays static package information. It does not process untrusted input in a risky manner, does not perform network operations, nor contains any obfuscation or malicious logic. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The code is benign.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements are present.\n- The current scoring is justified and should remain as is.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\nMaintain the scores at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
