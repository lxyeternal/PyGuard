  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, no external network activity, and no dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script functions solely as a command-line interface tool that displays package information and version details. It reads input only from command-line arguments and outputs information to standard output. There are no external data fetches, network connections, or sensitive data handling. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI script intended to display package info and version. It poses no security risk or malicious behavior.",
