  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Issue Presence:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI script that outputs static package info or version based on command-line argument `--version`.\n   - No dynamic data processing, external calls, or untrusted input handling is present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or external network activity.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature of the code; no logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The reports are consistent, thorough, and correctly identify the code as harmless.\n   - No issues are detected with the analysis or conclusions.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (or 0.0)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No need to adjust scores; they align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score in reports is 0, indicating no concern.\n   - Since the code is purely informational with no malicious elements, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware score = 0.\n   - No malicious activity is present, so this is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; the reports are cautious and accurate.\n   - The analysis confirms no hidden threats or assumptions are overlooked.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional Remarks:\nGiven the code's simplicity and the thoroughness of the reports, I agree with the assessments. The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the detailed analysis.",
