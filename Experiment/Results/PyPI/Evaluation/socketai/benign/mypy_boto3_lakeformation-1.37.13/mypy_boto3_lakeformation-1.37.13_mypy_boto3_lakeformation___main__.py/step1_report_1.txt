{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point for a package that provides information about the boto3 LakeFormation library, including version and documentation details.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) and writes output to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "The code writes informational text to stdout; no untrusted data handling or external system calls are present.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, the code flows from source (sys.argv) to print_version() and then returns; otherwise, it flows from main() to print_info().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious code elements.",
  "analysis": "The script simply checks for a command-line argument '--version' to output the package version, otherwise it outputs package information. It imports sys and uses standard print/write methods. No external network calls, data leaks, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code is standard, minimal, and clean, serving purely informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely as a CLI for displaying package info, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
