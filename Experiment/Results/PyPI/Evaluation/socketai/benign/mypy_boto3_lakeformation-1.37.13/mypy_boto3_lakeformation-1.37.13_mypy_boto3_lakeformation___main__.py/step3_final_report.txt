  "purpose": "A minimal CLI script that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input argument '--version'",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for outputting package info or version",
  "flows": "sys.argv check (source) to sys.stdout.write (sink) for output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with static outputs, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution, no external data handling",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that checks for '--version' argument and outputs either version info or package details. It does not process untrusted input beyond argument presence, has no network calls, no secrets, and no obfuscation. The logic is static and direct, with functions clearly separated. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and static nature imply no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. It only outputs static information and performs no risky operations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and justified.",
