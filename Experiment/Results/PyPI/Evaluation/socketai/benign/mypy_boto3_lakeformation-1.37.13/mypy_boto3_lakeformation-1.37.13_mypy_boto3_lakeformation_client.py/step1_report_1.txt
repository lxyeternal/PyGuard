  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for the boto3 LakeFormation client with methods to interact with AWS LakeFormation service.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; type annotations and overloads.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to AWS services via boto3; parameters like 'Params' and other kwargs; return statements with AWS responses.",
  "flows": "User invokes methods with parameters, which are then processed and sent as requests to AWS services; responses are returned to caller.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Code consists of method signatures and type annotations. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network connections are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward type annotation and class definition for a boto3 client wrapper. It defines methods matching AWS LakeFormation API calls, with appropriate type annotations and overloads for pagination. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or unauthorized network activity. The code appears to be part of an SDK or type stubs for AWS SDK interaction, which is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, type-annotated interface for AWS LakeFormation SDK, providing method signatures and type hints. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks in the provided code.",
