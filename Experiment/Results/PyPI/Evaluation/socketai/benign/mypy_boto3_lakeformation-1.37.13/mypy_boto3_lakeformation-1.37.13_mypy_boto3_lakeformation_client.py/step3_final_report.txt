{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the boto3 LakeFormation client, providing static method signatures and documentation for SDK usage.",
  "sources": "Method signatures accepting parameters via **kwargs, documentation strings, and type annotations referencing request and response types.",
  "sinks": "Method calls that would invoke AWS API operations, but no actual runtime logic or data handling is present in this static interface.",
  "flows": "Method signatures with parameters flowing into AWS service calls; no dynamic data flow or execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code is purely static and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, type-annotated SDK interface for AWS LakeFormation, with method signatures, documentation, and type references. No runtime logic, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The use of **kwargs is standard for SDK method signatures, and no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, static SDK interface with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor potential concern is the acceptance of untrusted parameters, which is typical for SDK wrappers and does not indicate malicious activity.",
