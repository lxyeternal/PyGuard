  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the LakeFormation client in boto3, providing type hints for SDK methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; method definitions with kwargs unpacked from type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Methods accepting untrusted input via **kwargs, mainly in the form of request type definitions; methods returning data or status info.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (kwargs) flows into method parameters, potentially affecting SDK call parameters; data returned from SDK methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic; code appears to be a structured interface with type hints, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured class definition for the LakeFormation client with method signatures, property annotations, and overloads for pagination. It imports type definitions and uses them to specify method parameter types, which are unpacked from external type defs. No dynamic code, no command execution, no suspicious data handling. It strictly adheres to SDK interface patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SDK interface implementation with no malicious intent. It only provides type hints and method signatures for AWS LakeFormation SDK calls. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flow is present.",
