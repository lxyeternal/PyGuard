{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-lakeformation package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, importing setup from setuptools, defining package data, and specifying dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or data sinks that could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md (source) flows into long_description; setup parameters and dependencies are static data; no dynamic or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a static README file for documentation, and calls setup() with fixed parameters defining the package's metadata, dependencies, and configuration. There are no dynamic inputs, user inputs, or network interactions. No potential vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The code strictly adheres to standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies, with no untrusted data processing or malicious behavior.",
