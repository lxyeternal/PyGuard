  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the mypy-boto3-lakeformation library.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "File read into variable, used in setup() call; static data flows into package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and adheres to standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. It reads a local README file and passes static metadata to setuptools.setup(). No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activity are present. The consistent scores across multiple reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) accurately reflect the benign nature of the script. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices confirm its safety and lack of security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. All evidence points to a safe, straightforward implementation.",
