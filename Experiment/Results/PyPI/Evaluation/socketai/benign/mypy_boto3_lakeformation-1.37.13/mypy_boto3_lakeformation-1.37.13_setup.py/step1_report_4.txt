{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the mypy-boto3-lakeformation Python module.",
  "sources": "Reads __file__ to determine the current directory for reading README.md",
  "sinks": "Uses setup() to define package metadata and dependencies; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "Reads local file for long_description, then passes static configuration data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a local README file for long description, and invokes setup() with predefined package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. All data appears static and well-structured, serving as a standard package setup script. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or code injection are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no security risks identified.",
