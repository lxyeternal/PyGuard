  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is purely a set of type alias definitions using `Literal` for AWS Lakeformation and other AWS service constants.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- No data processing, user input, network activity, or external interactions are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The purpose is to improve type safety and documentation, not to perform any runtime logic or data handling.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Define string literal types for AWS Lakeformation service and related constants.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is safe, purely declarative, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security risk 0, Obfuscated 0, Confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining string literals for AWS services.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes the code is static, with no data flow or external dependencies.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security risk 0, Obfuscated 0, Confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Defines string literals for AWS LakeFormation and SDK components.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurately describes the code as straightforward, with standard conditional import, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security risk 0, Obfuscated 0, Confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Type literals for AWS LakeFormation parameters and services.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is benign, purely for type annotations, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security risk 0, Obfuscated 0, Confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Type alias definitions for AWS services and parameters.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as static, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security risk 0, Obfuscated 0, Confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify the code as a benign, declarative set of type definitions.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports, which is accurate.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** None, as the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations beyond static type annotations.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the provided assessments. The code is a standard, safe utility for type annotations, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, as it's purely static type definitions, but I assign a minimal non-zero for safety in case of future changes)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe.
