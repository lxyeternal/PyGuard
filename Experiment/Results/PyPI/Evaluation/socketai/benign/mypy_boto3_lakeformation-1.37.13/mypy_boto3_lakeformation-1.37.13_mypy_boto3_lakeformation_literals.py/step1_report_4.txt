{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS LakeFormation service and other AWS SDK components to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "String literals assigned to various variables, imports of sys and typing modules, conditional import based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sink points or untrusted data flows are present; the code is purely defining types and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code simply assigns static literals to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of conditional import is standard for compatibility, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions for literals representing AWS LakeFormation and other AWS service identifiers. It includes a version check for importing 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions', which is a common compatibility pattern. No dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The literals are static and well-defined, serving as type hints. No indications of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type definition module used for type annotations and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It serves its purpose of defining AWS-related string literal types safely and effectively.",
