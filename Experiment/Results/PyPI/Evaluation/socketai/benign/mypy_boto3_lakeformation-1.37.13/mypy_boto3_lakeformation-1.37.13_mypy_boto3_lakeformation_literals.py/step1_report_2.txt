{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for the lakeformation service and related AWS services, for type annotations and documentation.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for various string-based types, conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only defines constants and types.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from sources to sinks; just static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard type annotations and conditional imports. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward type definition for AWS service literals, with conditional import for compatibility with Python versions. No user input, network operations, or file handling present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. It appears to be a benign, well-structured module for type hints.",
  "conclusion": "This module solely provides type aliases for AWS service literals, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard, safe utility for code documentation and type checking.",
