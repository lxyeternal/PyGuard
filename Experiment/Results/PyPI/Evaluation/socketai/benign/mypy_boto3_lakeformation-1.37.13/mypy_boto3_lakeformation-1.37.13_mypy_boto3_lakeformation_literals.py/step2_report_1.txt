  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is solely for defining string literal types for AWS Lakeformation and related services.\n- No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or data flows are present.\n- The code is static, declarative, and uses standard practices like conditional import for Python version compatibility.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The purpose is clear: to provide type safety and documentation support for AWS SDKs.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** Completely benign, purely type annotations.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Straightforward type definitions, no external data handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Correct, no concerns.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Clear, static type aliasing, no dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, safe.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Standard pattern for compatibility, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Correct, benign.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Well-structured, purely for type annotations.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary and final assessment:**\n\n- **Code content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely for static type annotations of AWS service literals.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected across all reports; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present; scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Security risk:** No external data, no dynamic code, no secrets; scores of 0 are correct.\n- **Overall confidence:** High (1), consistent across all reports.\n\n### **My final estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (benign, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\nThis code is a standard, safe utility module for type safety in AWS SDK usage, with no indicators of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose for type annotations. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
