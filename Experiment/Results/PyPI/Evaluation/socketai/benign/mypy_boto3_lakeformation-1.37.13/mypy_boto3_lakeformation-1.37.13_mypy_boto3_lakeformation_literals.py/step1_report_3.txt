{
  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for AWS LakeFormation service and other AWS services, primarily for type annotations and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and typing modules; defines various Literal type annotations with hardcoded string values.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data handling; no untrusted data processing or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code consists solely of static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. Usage of conditional import for typing.Literal based on Python version is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward collection of type annotations using Literal, intended for static type checking. It imports sys and conditionally imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions. All definitions are static string literals, serving as constants for type safety. No dynamic execution, external data input, or malicious patterns are present. The purpose appears to be documentation and type safety, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as type annotations for AWS service literals. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. No suspicious activity or anomalies detected.",
