  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS Lakeformation and related services to facilitate type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals assigned to variables, conditional import of Literal based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, external data handling, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A; purely static type aliasing without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and uses standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using Literal for AWS service constants, with conditional import for compatibility. No dynamic behavior, data processing, or external communication exists. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The purpose is to provide type safety and improve code clarity. All reports correctly identify the benign, declarative nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with confidence of 1. The code is safe, standard, and free of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility module for type annotations with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
