  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's nature, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a collection of type alias definitions using `Literal` for AWS Lakeformation and other AWS service constants.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- There are no data flows, user inputs, external communications, or dynamic behaviors.\n- No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The purpose is purely to facilitate static type checking and improve code clarity/documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Define string literal types for AWS Lakeformation service and related constants.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as purely declarative, with no malicious intent.\n- **Security risk:** Zero.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining literals for AWS services.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the static nature, no data processing, or external interactions.\n- **Security risk:** Zero.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines string literal types for AWS LakeFormation and SDK components.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; no dynamic code or malicious patterns.\n- **Security risk:** Zero.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar purpose, for type checking and clarity.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Security risk:** Zero.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Again, defining static literals for AWS parameters.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic behavior, external data, or suspicious code.\n- **Security risk:** Zero.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is purely declarative and contains no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or lower, since there's no security concern beyond the benign nature of type definitions.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The code's purpose is to provide type safety and documentation support, which is standard in SDKs and type hinting modules.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could introduce security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- The code is safe, with no security risks or malware potential.\n- The only potential concern is if such literals are used maliciously elsewhere, but within this file, there's no indication of that.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores assigned are justified. The code is a benign, standard utility for type annotations with no security concerns.",
