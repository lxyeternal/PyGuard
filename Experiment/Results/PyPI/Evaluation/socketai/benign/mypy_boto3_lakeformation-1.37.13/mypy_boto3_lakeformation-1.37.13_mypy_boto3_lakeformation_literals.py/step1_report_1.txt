{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS Lakeformation service and related constants for type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Import statement from sys, type annotations for literals, and variable assignments defining string literal types.",
  "sinks": "None. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are processed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions or data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code solely establishes type aliasing for literals representing various AWS Lakeformation and AWS service constants. It imports 'sys' to determine Python version and conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. No data processing, user input handling, or external communications are present. The variables are just type annotations with predefined string values. No malicious or suspicious code segments identified. The code is purely declarative, aimed at type safety.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, standard set of type definitions for AWS Lakeformation literals. There are no indicators of malicious intent, no external data handling, and no suspicious code behavior. It serves a documentation and type-checking purpose.",
