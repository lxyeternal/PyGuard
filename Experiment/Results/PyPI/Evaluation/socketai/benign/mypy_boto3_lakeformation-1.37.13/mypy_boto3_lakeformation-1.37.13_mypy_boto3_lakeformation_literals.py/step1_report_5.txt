  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS LakeFormation service parameters and other AWS services, aiding in type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Static string literals defining valid values for different parameters and service identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data flow operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code consists of type alias definitions with no data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code is purely declarative, defining type literals.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' to conditionally import 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version, then defines a large set of string literal types for AWS services, resource types, and other parameters. All definitions are static string literals used for type annotations. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The purpose is to provide strong typing for AWS SDKs, which is a common and benign practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions for AWS service parameters. It contains no malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is a safe, standard utility module for type safety in AWS-related Python code.",
