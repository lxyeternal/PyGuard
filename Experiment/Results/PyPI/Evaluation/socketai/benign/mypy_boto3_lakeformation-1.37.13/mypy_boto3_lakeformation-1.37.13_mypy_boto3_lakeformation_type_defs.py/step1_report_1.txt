{
  "purpose": "The code provides type definitions for various AWS Lake Formation service operations, primarily for static type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from type annotations, imported modules, and constants such as sys.version_info, imported types, and standard library modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or execution of untrusted code are present. No network, file, or environment modifications are visible.",
  "flows": "Type definitions are static and do not involve dynamic data flows; they only define data structures. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation, are detected. The code is straightforward, mainly containing data class definitions and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of type annotations, TypedDict classes, conditional imports for compatibility, and union types. It imports no functions that perform I/O, network, or system modifications. The initial comment block contains documentation and licensing information. There are no signs of code execution, dynamic code generation, or malicious logic. The use of 'sys.version_info' and conditional imports appear to be for compatibility purposes, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type definitions for AWS Lake Formation SDKs, with no malicious behavior detected. It solely defines data structures for type checking and documentation. No suspicious activities, backdoors, or malware signatures are present.",
