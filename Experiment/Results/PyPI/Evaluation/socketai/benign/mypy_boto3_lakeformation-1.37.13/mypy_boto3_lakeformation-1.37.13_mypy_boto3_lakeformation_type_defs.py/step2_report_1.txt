  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any discrepancies, potential issues, or inconsistencies.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is purely static type definitions for AWS Lake Formation SDK, with no runtime logic, external data handling, or malicious activity.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), and malware/security risk scores are zero.\n- The reports emphasize the absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Consistency:\n- **Code Content:** The code is mainly composed of `TypedDict` classes, type aliases, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and documentation. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- **No Sinks or Flows:** No evidence of data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The code is declarative, defining data structures.\n- **No Hardcoded Secrets or Obfuscation:** No secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n- **Purpose & Usage:** Clearly intended for static type checking and documentation, consistent across all reports.\n\n### Potential Anomalies or Concerns:\n- **Conditional Imports:** Use of `sys.version_info` for compatibility is standard and not suspicious.\n- **Documentation & Licensing:** The initial comment block contains documentation and licensing info, which is typical for SDK code.\n- **Imports:** Only standard, third-party, and internal type definitions are imported; no external data or untrusted input sources are involved.\n- **Code Behavior:** No executable logic, no eval/exec, no code injection points.\n\n### Consistency & Scores:\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n- The risk scores are all 0, justified by the absence of runtime or external data handling.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Are any claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?** No. All assessments correctly identify the code as purely static type definitions.\n- **Are the scores unreasonable?** No, they are consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Are there any signs of malicious activity?** No.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My Own Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0.0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n**Risk Score:** 0.0 — No security risk, as it’s purely static type definitions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, intended for static type checking, and poses no supply chain security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that the actual runtime code interacting with these types is similarly scrutinized, but based solely on this type definition module, there are no concerns.",
