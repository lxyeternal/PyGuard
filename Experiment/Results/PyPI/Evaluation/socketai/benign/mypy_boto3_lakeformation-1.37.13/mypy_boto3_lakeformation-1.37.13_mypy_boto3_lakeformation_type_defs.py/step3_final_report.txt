  "purpose": "Type annotations for lakeformation service type definitions.",
  "sources": "Static type definitions, type aliases, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "None; the code is purely declarative and does not process or handle data at runtime.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code defines data structures without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard SDK type definitions with conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of TypedDict classes, type aliases, and conditional imports to support multiple Python versions. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The absence of runtime logic, external data handling, or obfuscation indicates that this is a static type declaration module intended for type checking and documentation. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code's structure and content are consistent with standard SDK type definitions, and the use of conditional imports is a common practice for compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended solely for type annotations. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The high confidence and zero scores for malware and security risk are justified.",
