{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS Lake Formation service, providing structured data models for requests and responses in the SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, botocore.response, and internal literals; all used to define data structures.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data flows from untrusted sources or external inputs within this code.",
  "flows": "This code purely defines data types and does not contain executable logic or data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution. All code is static type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of TypedDict class definitions, type aliases, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It lacks functions, method calls, or runtime logic. No external data ingestion, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The presence of type annotations and class structures aligns with standard SDK data modeling practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a comprehensive set of static type definitions for the AWS Lake Formation SDK, with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely as a schema for data structures used in API interactions. No suspicious or harmful code is present.",
