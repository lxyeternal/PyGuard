  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS LakeFormation service in Python",
  "sources": "Definitions of TypedDict classes, type aliases, and import statements; no user input or external data sources",
  "sinks": "None observed; no code execution, data output, or external system interaction",
  "flows": "None; primarily static type definitions and imports",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, eval, exec, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type annotations using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It imports modules and types from standard and third-party libraries to define structured data types for AWS LakeFormation SDK. There is no runtime logic, data processing, or network activity. The presence of documentation and strict type annotations suggests a focus on code clarity and type safety, not malicious behavior. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present; the code appears to be a clean, well-structured type definition module.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only static type definitions and import statements for AWS LakeFormation SDK in Python. It does not perform any runtime actions, data processing, or external interactions that could be malicious. Therefore, it is safe and does not pose any supply chain security risk.",
