{
  "purpose": "Type annotations for lakeformation service type definitions, facilitating static type checking and documentation for AWS Lake Formation SDK.",
  "sources": "Static type definitions, import statements, and union/type alias declarations; no dynamic or user input reading sources.",
  "sinks": "No sink points for untrusted data; no code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; code is solely type definitions and data structure declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. Usage of standard type annotations and conditional imports based on sys.version_info.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of Python type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and union/type aliases for the AWS Lake Formation SDK. It imports necessary modules and type definitions, then declares various data structures used in the SDK. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data processing logic is present. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors are detected. The structure adheres to standard type definition practices for Python static type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type definitions intended for static analysis and documentation, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate SDK type declaration module.",
