  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any discrepancies, logical flaws, or signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely type definitions for AWS Lake Formation SDK, with no runtime logic, no data leaks, and no malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes the absence of dynamic code, external data processing, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0 — **reasonable**.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues detected. The report's reasoning aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code only contains static type annotations and data structures, with no code execution or external interactions.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis accurately identifies the code as purely declarative, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign; the report's reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing the absence of runtime logic, external data handling, or malicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as static type definitions, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues detected; the reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive set of static type definitions with no dynamic or external data sources.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the lack of executable logic, external data flow, or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0 — **reasonable**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe and benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is solely static type annotations, with no external data flow or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; the code is a typical SDK type declaration.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a static, purely declarative set of type definitions for the AWS Lake Formation SDK.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or dynamic behavior.\n- **Security Risk:** Zero; the code is a benign SDK type declaration module.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0.0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0.0** — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.0** — no security risk associated with static type definitions.\n\n**Summary:** The entire set of reports aligns well with the code's nature. There are no indications of supply chain risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that the actual deployment environment and build process do not inject or modify these type definitions maliciously. Based solely on the provided code, it is safe.",
