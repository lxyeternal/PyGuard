  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential issues, logical consistency, and the presence of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is purely type definitions for AWS Lake Formation SDK, with no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code contains only static type annotations, conditional imports for compatibility, and no runtime logic or external data handling.  \n- **Malware score justification:** The malware score is 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound; no issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is only static type definitions with no dynamic or malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes the lack of runtime logic, external data processing, or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Malware score justification:** Malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.  \n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a set of type annotations and data structures for AWS SDK, with no malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is aligned with the code content—no executable logic, no external data handling, no obfuscation.  \n- **Malware score justification:** Zero malware risk is appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues detected; the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** The code is static type definitions for AWS Lake Formation, with no data flow from untrusted sources or malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly emphasizes the static nature of the code, the absence of executable logic, and the standard use of type annotations.  \n- **Malware score justification:** Malware score of 0 is justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion is consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** The code is solely type annotations and data structure declarations, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code content—no dynamic code, no external data handling, no obfuscation.  \n- **Malware score justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**  \nAll reports uniformly identify that the code is purely static type definitions for the AWS Lake Formation SDK. They correctly note the absence of executable logic, external data handling, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The malware scores of 0 across all reports are justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the assessments. The code is benign, with no signs of supply chain security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The high confidence levels (mostly 1.0) are justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.0  \n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a well-structured, purely declarative set of type definitions for AWS Lake Formation SDK, with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
