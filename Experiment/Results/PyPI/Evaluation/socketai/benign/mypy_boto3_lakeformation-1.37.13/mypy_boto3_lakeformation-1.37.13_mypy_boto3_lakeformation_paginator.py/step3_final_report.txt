  "purpose": "Type annotations and class wrappers for boto3 LakeFormation paginators to facilitate static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Paginator classes and their 'paginate' methods accepting **kwargs with Unpack[...], which are user-supplied parameters for API calls.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted input via **kwargs potentially influencing paginator behavior, but no actual data leaks or malicious actions occur.",
  "flows": "User provides kwargs to 'paginate' methods, which are unpacked into request parameters; no external data read/write or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of **kwargs with Unpack[...] is standard in boto3 but could, in theory, be exploited if inputs are malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated set of type stub classes for boto3 paginators, with no external data reading, network activity, or obfuscation. The 'paginate' methods accept kwargs that could be manipulated, but this pattern is typical in SDKs. No malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The minor security risk score (0.1 or 0.2) reflects the potential misuse of untrusted input but does not indicate actual malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and aligns with standard SDK patterns. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The slight risk scores are justified by the use of flexible kwargs, which could be misused if inputs are malicious, but this is inherent to boto3's design and not indicative of malicious behavior.",
