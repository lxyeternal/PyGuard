  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for the lakeformation service client, facilitating typed interactions with AWS LakeFormation paginators.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class method parameters and internal logic.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept arbitrary keyword arguments (**kwargs) which are unpacked using Unpack into request type definitions.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data can flow from **kwargs into the paginate method, which then passes it to the underlying Paginator's paginate method, returning a PageIterator.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of dynamic typing is standard for such generated stub classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines typed paginator classes for the lakeformation client, with method signatures matching boto3 conventions. It uses TYPE_CHECKING guards to optimize runtime type checking. No external input is explicitly read; the only data flow involves user-supplied kwargs passed into paginate methods. No malicious behavior or malicious data handling observed. The code is consistent with generated boto3 stub patterns and does not contain malicious or suspicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, auto-generated type stub classes for boto3 paginators. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks identified. The structure and logic align with standard type annotations and boto3 design patterns.",
