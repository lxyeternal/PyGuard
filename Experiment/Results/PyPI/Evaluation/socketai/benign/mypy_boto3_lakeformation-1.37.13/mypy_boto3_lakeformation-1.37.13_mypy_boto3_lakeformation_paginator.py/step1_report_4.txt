{
  "purpose": "Define paginators for the lakeformation service client, providing type annotations and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module. Data read mainly occurs through method parameters and type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters are used as untrusted input to generate paginated API calls; no direct data leaks or unsafe sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the paginate methods, which return PageIterator objects, enabling iteration over paginated responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code structure is straightforward and consistent with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class definitions for paginators with type annotations and docstrings referencing AWS documentation. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, defines base classes depending on type checking, and implements paginate methods with proper typing. No suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious logic observed. All components align with standard SDK extension patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard, well-structured extension of boto3 paginator classes with comprehensive type annotations. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
