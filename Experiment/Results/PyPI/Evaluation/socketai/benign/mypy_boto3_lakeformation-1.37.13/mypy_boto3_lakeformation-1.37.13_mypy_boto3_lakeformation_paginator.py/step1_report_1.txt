{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginators for the boto3 LakeFormation service client, facilitating static type checking and improved IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and custom type_defs. No external or untrusted sources read data in a malicious way.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data or send untrusted input to external systems. No network, file, or environment variable sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code defines classes and methods for pagination, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks. No source-to-sink malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. Use of version checks for type extension is standard. No anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type annotations, class definitions for paginators, and method overrides with detailed docstrings linking to documentation. The structure is standard for type stub files, with conditional imports for compatibility. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code’s purpose is solely to provide type safety and documentation support for AWS LakeFormation paginators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily serving as type annotations and class wrappers for boto3 paginators. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The implementation is clean, standard, and focused on type safety.",
