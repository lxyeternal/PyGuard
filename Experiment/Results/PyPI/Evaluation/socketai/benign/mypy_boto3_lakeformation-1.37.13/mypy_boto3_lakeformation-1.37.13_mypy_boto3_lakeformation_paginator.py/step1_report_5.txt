  "purpose": "Define paginators for LakeFormation service client using boto3, with type annotations for improved type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; the class methods and their parameters, especially the 'paginate' methods and their kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods that accept **kwargs: Unpack[...] which could potentially be used to pass malicious or unintended data into paginator calls.",
  "flows": "Inputs to 'paginate' methods (from kwargs) flow into paginator calls which could, in a malicious context, be manipulated to cause unwanted behavior or resource exhaustion.",
  "anomalies": "Use of **kwargs with Unpack[...] in 'paginate' methods might allow external input to influence paginator behavior, but this is standard in boto3 paginators. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or backdoors are evident. No obfuscation present. The code appears to follow standard pattern for boto3 paginator wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several paginator classes inheriting from generic Paginator types, with type annotations for request and response types. The 'paginate' methods accept arbitrary kwargs unpacked with type annotations, which aligns with boto3's design. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code structure is straightforward, primarily wrapping boto3 paginator classes with added type annotations for better static type checking. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or dangerous behaviors are detected. The inclusion of version-specific imports and strict type hints suggests careful, standard implementation rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, type-annotated set of paginator class definitions for the LakeFormation boto3 client. It appears to be a legitimate, safe, and well-structured implementation without malicious behavior. The only minor consideration is the use of **kwargs with Unpack, which is common for boto3 pagination but could theoretically be exploited if inputs are untrusted; however, this is standard practice and not inherently malicious.",
