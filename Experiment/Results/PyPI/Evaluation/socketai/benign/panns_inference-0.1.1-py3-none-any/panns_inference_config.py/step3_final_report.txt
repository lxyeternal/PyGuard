{
  "purpose": "Load and process label data from a CSV file, downloading it if not present locally.",
  "sources": "Checks file existence, creates directories, downloads CSV via os.system('wget ...'), reads CSV file.",
  "sinks": "CSV file reading, data parsing; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "File existence check -> Directory creation -> Download via os.system -> CSV reading -> Data extraction and mapping.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system('wget ...') for downloading, which is less secure than Python libraries; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file handling and CSV parsing. It downloads a trusted CSV file from Google Cloud Storage if missing. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The use of os.system for downloading introduces a minor security concern but does not constitute malicious behavior. The CSV content is trusted, and no data exfiltration or backdoors are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with minimal security risk primarily due to the use of os.system for downloading. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
