{
  "purpose": "The code downloads and loads a CSV file containing class labels and their IDs for use in an audio processing or classification project.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CSV file from local disk and downloads it from an external URL if it does not exist.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data beyond reading from a CSV file and downloading a file via wget; no direct data leakage or malicious data flow is evident.",
  "flows": "If the CSV file does not exist, it is downloaded from a remote URL; then, the file is read line-by-line into memory, and label mappings are created.",
  "anomalies": "The use of os.system with wget for downloading files can be unsafe if the filename or URL were controlled by an attacker (not the case here). The code relies on external network and filesystem operations but contains no malicious payloads or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward check for the existence of a label CSV file; if missing, it downloads it from a trusted Google storage URL. It then reads and processes the CSV to extract labels and IDs, creating mapping dictionaries. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network behavior are present. The use of os.system with wget could be a minor security concern if inputs were controlled, but here the URL and filename are static and controlled. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard data loading and preprocessing tasks with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It’s safe with regard to supply chain or malicious code inclusion.",
