{
  "purpose": "The code downloads and loads a CSV file containing class labels and their indices for use in an audio classification task.",
  "sources": "Reading local CSV file, checking for file existence, executing wget command to download file if missing.",
  "sinks": "System call to 'wget' for downloading the file, reading the CSV file into memory.",
  "flows": "Check file existence -> download via system call -> read CSV content -> store labels and IDs in memory.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with wget for downloading files instead of secure HTTP libraries; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs a file path in the user's home directory for the labels CSV. If the file does not exist, it creates necessary directories and uses os.system to invoke wget for downloading the CSV from a public URL. The CSV is then read line-by-line, extracting IDs and labels, and mappings between labels and indices are created. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of os.system with wget could pose security risks if the URL is compromised or manipulated, but as it points to a static, trusted Google Cloud URL, the risk is minimal in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard file download and data loading operations with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The main concern is the use of os.system for downloading, which is less secure than using dedicated HTTP libraries, but this is common in simple scripts. No malware or malicious activity detected.",
