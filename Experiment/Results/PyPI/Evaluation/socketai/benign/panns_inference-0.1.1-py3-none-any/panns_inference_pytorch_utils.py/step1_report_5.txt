  "purpose": "Utility functions for tensor manipulation, interpolation, padding, and data mixing in PyTorch for sound event detection.",
  "sources": "None explicitly, all input data comes from function parameters.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, functions operate on provided tensors without external data transmission or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input tensors flow through interpolation, padding, and mixup functions; no external data flows or network operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "The do_mixup function performs tensor mixing, but this is a common data augmentation technique and not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code features identified. The code uses standard PyTorch operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for tensor processing in PyTorch, such as moving data to devices, interpolating tensors, padding tensors, and performing mixup augmentation. No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code does not contain obfuscated or hidden functionalities. The functions are straightforward and align with common machine learning practices. No suspicious behaviors, code injections, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for sound event detection processing, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs tensor operations typical in ML workflows without any malicious or suspicious features.",
