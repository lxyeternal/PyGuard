  "purpose": "Utility functions for tensor manipulation, interpolation, padding, and mixup data augmentation in PyTorch.",
  "sources": "Function arguments such as 'x', 'framewise_output', 'mixup_lambda', and 'device'.",
  "sinks": "Potential data transformations, tensor operations, and data augmentation steps.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through tensor type conversions, interpolation, padding, and mixup calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. Use of straightforward tensor operations and data augmentation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code provides common neural network utility functions: moving data to devices, interpolating tensors, padding tensor sequences, and applying mixup augmentation. All functions perform standard tensor manipulations with no suspicious code patterns, obfuscated logic, or malicious instructions. No network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears benign and intended solely for data preprocessing and augmentation within a neural network pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for PyTorch-based audio processing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
