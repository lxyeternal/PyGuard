{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for data manipulation, interpolation, padding, and mixup augmentation in audio processing models.",
  "sources": "Inputs are tensors from data pipelines (e.g., x, mixup_lambda, framewise_output), primarily from model or data loader outputs.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; data is processed internally without external outputs or network calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input tensors through functions for reshaping, padding, and augmentation; no external or untrusted sink interactions observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as hardcoded credentials, network connections, or obfuscated code. The functions perform standard tensor operations and augmentations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for tensor conversion, interpolation, padding, and data augmentation (mixup). There are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of tensor operations and straightforward class definitions suggests normal functionality related to audio data processing. No external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for audio model processing without malicious intent. It performs standard tensor manipulations and data augmentation. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are detected.",
