  "purpose": "Standard CNN-based audio classification model utilizing spectrogram and logmel feature extraction, with data augmentation.",
  "sources": "Reads input audio data, spectrogram and logmel features, applies data augmentation (SpecAugmentation, Mixup).",
  "sinks": "Outputs classification probabilities; no external data transmission or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input audio -> Spectrogram -> Logmel features -> Data augmentation -> CNN layers -> Classification output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a typical audio classification pipeline with standard libraries and practices. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions and modules used are common in ML workflows. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are observed. The data flow is straightforward from input to output, with data augmentation applied locally. The model initialization and forward pass are standard, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of CNN-based audio classification models. No malicious activity, sabotage, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the analysis.",
