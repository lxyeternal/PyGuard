{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes for audio tagging and sound event detection inference, managing model loading, device allocation, and inference execution.",
  "sources": "Reads model checkpoint files from local filesystem; loads audio data for inference.",
  "sinks": "Outputs inference results as numpy arrays; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Loads model checkpoints via hardcoded URLs using os.system('wget ...'), then processes audio tensors through model inference to produce output arrays.",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.system() with hardcoded URLs for downloading model files without checksum verification; no obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard model loading and inference for audio tagging and detection. The download process via os.system() could be exploited if URLs are manipulated, but in this context, URLs are static and appear legitimate. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of os.system() is a security concern but not malicious. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of audio inference wrappers with minor security concerns related to the download method. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The malware score remains at 0; the security risk score is low (~0.2), primarily due to the download approach lacking checksum validation.",
