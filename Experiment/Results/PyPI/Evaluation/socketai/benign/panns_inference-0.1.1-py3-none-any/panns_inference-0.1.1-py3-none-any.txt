      "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of audio inference wrappers with minor security concerns related to the download method. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The malware score remains at 0; the security risk score is low (~0.2), primarily due to the download approach lacking checksum validation."

The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the analysis."
