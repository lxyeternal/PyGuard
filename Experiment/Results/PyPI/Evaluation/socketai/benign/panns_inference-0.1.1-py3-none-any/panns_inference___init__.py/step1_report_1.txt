  "purpose": "Importing audio tagging and sound event detection modules and labels for use in an audio processing application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data is being written to external locations or used in a way that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present, as the code only imports modules and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement structure commonly used in Python packages to include functionalities from other modules. It also sets a version string. No suspicious or malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is detectable. The imports are from relative modules, typical for package internal structure. There is no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module import and version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
