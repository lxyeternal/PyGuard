  "purpose": "This code performs straightforward relative imports from internal modules and sets a version string, typical for package initialization.",
  "sources": "Imports from .inference and .config modules, setting __version__",
  "sinks": "None; no data read/write, network activity, or dynamic execution present",
  "flows": "Import statements and version assignment, with no data flow to external sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, clear, and standard",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module import and version declaration with no suspicious or malicious behavior. No network activity, data leaks, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
