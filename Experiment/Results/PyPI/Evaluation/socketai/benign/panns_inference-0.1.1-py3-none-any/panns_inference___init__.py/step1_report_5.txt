{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules related to inference tasks (AudioTagging, SoundEventDetection) and configuration labels, likely for an audio processing or machine learning application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .inference and .config",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations observed",
  "flows": "Imports are static and do not involve data flow from untrusted sources; no runtime data flows detected",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a version string assignment. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks that could indicate malicious activity. The modules imported are likely part of the intended functionality for inference tasks. The code is minimal, well-structured, and contains no suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears to be a standard import and version declaration for a Python package or module.",
