{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes and variables from local modules and sets a version string, likely part of a larger audio processing package.",
  "sources": "Imports from .inference and .config modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "Not explicitly defined, but likely involves internal data flow within the package",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports of classes (AudioTagging, SoundEventDetection) and a variable (labels) from local modules, and defines a version string. There are no network operations, data handling, or other suspicious activities. The code appears to be part of a normal module initialization or setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and benign, serving as a part of a larger audio processing library without any malicious intent or security risks.",
