{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that imports specific classes and data related to audio tagging and sound event detection, likely for use in audio analysis applications.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .inference and .config",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leak points are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply imports components and sets a version string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed; the code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from a local module, which are likely used elsewhere in the package, and imports labels from a configuration module. It also sets a version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious operations. The code is structured simply, with no dynamic execution, network operations, or data handling that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, typical for a Python package setup or module import script, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
