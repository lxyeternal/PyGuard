  "purpose": "Importing classes and data from local modules for audio tagging and sound event detection, and setting a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.inference and .config), access to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no output or data transmission present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only module imports and a version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules and a simple version string assignment. There are no indications of reading external input, writing to files, network activity, or executing untrusted code. The imported modules are assumed to be part of the same package. No obfuscation or unusual constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, performing standard module imports and defining a version number. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
