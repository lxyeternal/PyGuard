  "purpose": "Plugin discovery via pkgutil and pyinstaller, supporting dynamic module loading based on regex patterns and lists.",
  "sources": "Module names from pkgutil.iter_modules(), module names from pyinstaller importer.toc, user-defined white_list and black_list.",
  "sinks": "do_import() function, which imports modules potentially executing arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Module names matching regex patterns and not in black_list are passed to do_import() for import, which executes module code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated warnings; reliance on user-controlled patterns and lists that could be manipulated to load malicious modules.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard plugin discovery, dynamically importing modules based on regex matches. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is the potential execution of malicious modules if patterns or lists are compromised. The code itself is straightforward and does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation. The risk stems from the inherent nature of dynamic imports in plugin systems, which can execute malicious code if untrusted modules are present. The malware score is appropriately 0, as no malicious code is detected. Obfuscation score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score is moderate (~0.3), reflecting the inherent risk of dynamic module execution, which can be mitigated by controlling plugin sources and patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin loader with no embedded malware or obfuscation. The main security risk is the potential for malicious modules to be loaded if patterns or lists are manipulated. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. Proper validation and trusted plugin sources can mitigate the inherent risks.",
