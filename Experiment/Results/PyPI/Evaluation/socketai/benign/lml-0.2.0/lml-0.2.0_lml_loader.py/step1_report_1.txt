  "purpose": "This module provides functions to discover and load plugins dynamically, supporting both pkgutil and pyinstaller packaging methods.",
  "sources": "User inputs through function parameters (e.g., plugin_name_patterns, pyinstaller_path, black_list, white_list); system module data via pkgutil.iter_modules and pkgutil.get_importer; potential external modules imported via do_import.",
  "sinks": "do_import function, which imports modules based on discovered names; potentially executing code in imported modules.",
  "flows": "Module name patterns and paths are used to find modules; modules are then imported via do_import, which may execute their code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated warnings and reliance on dynamic import via do_import without explicit validation of imported modules' content. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code constructs observed. The code dynamically imports modules based on regex matches, which could be exploited if malicious modules are present that match patterns. However, the code itself does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a plugin discovery utility that searches for modules matching specified regex patterns using pkgutil and pyinstaller-specific methods. It allows exclusion (black_list) and inclusion (white_list) of modules, then dynamically imports modules via do_import. The dynamic import could pose a risk if malicious modules are present that match the patterns, but the code itself is standard and does not contain obfuscated or malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or network activity is present. The code's structure is straightforward, with no evident malware or security risks embedded.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate plugin discovery utility with no embedded malicious intent. Its main risk lies in importing potentially malicious modules that match user-defined patterns, but this is an inherent risk of dynamic import mechanisms rather than malicious code itself. Overall, the code is safe under normal circumstances, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
