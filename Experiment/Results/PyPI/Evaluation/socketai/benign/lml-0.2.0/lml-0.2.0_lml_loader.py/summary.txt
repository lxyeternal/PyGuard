  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin loader with no embedded malware or obfuscation. The main security risk is the potential for malicious modules to be loaded if patterns or lists are manipulated. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. Proper validation and trusted plugin sources can mitigate the inherent risks."
