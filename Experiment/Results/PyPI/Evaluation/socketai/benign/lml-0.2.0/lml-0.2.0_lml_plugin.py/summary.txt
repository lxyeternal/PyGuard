  "conclusion": "The code is a typical plugin framework with no malicious behavior detected. The main security concern is the use of dynamic import without validation, which could be exploited if untrusted modules are loaded. Malware scores are correctly set to 0; obfuscation is absent. A moderate security risk (~0.45) is justified due to reliance on external, unvalidated import paths. Proper validation or sandboxing of imported modules is recommended to mitigate potential risks."
