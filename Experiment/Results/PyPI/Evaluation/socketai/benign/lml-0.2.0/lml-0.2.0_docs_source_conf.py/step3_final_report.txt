  "purpose": "Static configuration setup for Sphinx documentation generator.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static variable assignments and comments.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration with no dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Reassignment of 'html_theme' from 'sphinx_rtd_theme' to 'default' is benign; no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static Sphinx configuration file with no dynamic code, external data handling, or network activity. Variables such as DESCRIPTION are simple strings, and the redefinition of 'html_theme' is typical for configuration overrides. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present. All scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration file with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
