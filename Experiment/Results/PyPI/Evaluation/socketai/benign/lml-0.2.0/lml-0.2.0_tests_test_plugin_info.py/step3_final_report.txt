  "purpose": "Unit tests for the PluginInfo class, verifying initialization, properties, and behavior.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of PluginInfo objects, setting attributes, calling methods like tags() and __repr__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external system interactions; only internal attribute access and assertions.",
  "flows": "Creation of PluginInfo instances -> attribute access and method calls -> assertions for expected values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual control flow detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward unit tests that instantiate PluginInfo with fixed parameters, verify properties, and manipulate attributes in controlled scenarios. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The use of __repr__() output as JSON is standard and safe. The assignment to info.cls influences module_name in a test scenario but does not indicate malicious intent. All operations are benign, and the assertions confirm expected behavior. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of unit tests for PluginInfo, with no malicious or security-related issues. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
