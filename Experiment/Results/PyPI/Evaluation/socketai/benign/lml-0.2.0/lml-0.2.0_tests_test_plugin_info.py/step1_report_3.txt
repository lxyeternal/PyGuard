  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of unit tests for the PluginInfo class, verifying its properties and behaviors.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the instantiation of PluginInfo objects, attribute access (info.custom, info.tags(), info.module_name), and the __repr__ method output. No external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or security issues are identified. The code does not write data to external systems or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the creation of PluginInfo instances to attribute access and method calls. The flow from info.cls assignment to module_name property is straightforward and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns, are present. The code consists solely of test functions with standard assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit testing on a class named PluginInfo, verifying properties and methods. It involves creating instances with specified parameters, setting attributes, and asserting expected values. The __repr__ output is parsed from JSON. All actions are standard and do not involve external data, dynamic code execution, or security-sensitive operations. No suspicious behavior or malicious code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical set of unit tests for a Python class, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to verify class behavior.",
