  "purpose": "Define package metadata such as version and author information.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting __version__ and __author__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; simple variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and typical for package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns static string values to metadata variables (__version__, __author__). There are no input sources, no data processing, and no external communication. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident. The code appears to be standard package metadata boilerplate with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of static metadata variable assignments. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
