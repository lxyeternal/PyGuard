  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Content**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of static variable assignments:\n     ```python\n     __version__ = \"0.2.0\"\n     __author__ = \"C.W.\"\n     ```\n   - There are no input sources, sinks, data flows, or dynamic behaviors in any of the snippets.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is minimal, static, and typical for package metadata.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - All reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is justified because the code is purely static metadata with no external interactions or suspicious patterns.\n   - The `malware` score is also 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - No claims in the reports are based on unwarranted assumptions; all assessments are supported by the code's simplicity.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n  *Reasoning*: No malicious activity or code behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n  *Reasoning*: The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques.\n\n- **Risk Score**: 0  \n  *Reasoning*: The code is benign, static metadata with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. They correctly identify that this code is standard package metadata with no security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates** align with the reports:\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis code snippet is entirely benign.",
