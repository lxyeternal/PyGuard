  "purpose": "Static package metadata defining version and author information.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static variable assignments (__version__, __author__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignments without dynamic data or external dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, minimal, and standard for package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments for __version__ and __author__, with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or obfuscation. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is typical for package metadata and does not interact with external systems or data sources. The simplicity and clarity of the code indicate a benign purpose, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package metadata snippet with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
