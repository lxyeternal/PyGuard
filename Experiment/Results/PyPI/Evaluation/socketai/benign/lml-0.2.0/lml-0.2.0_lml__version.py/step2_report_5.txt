  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is simply assigning static string values to `__version__` and `__author__`.\n   - There are no dynamic behaviors, no external inputs, no data flows, and no obfuscation.\n   - No code patterns suggest malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - None identified. The code is minimal and standard for package metadata.\n\n3. **Score Justifications & Adjustments:**\n   - All reports assign scores:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (correct, no obfuscation)\n     - `malware`: 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (correct, no security risk)\n     - `confidence`: 1 (high confidence in the benign nature)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and clarity.\n\n4. **Risk & Malware Scores:**\n   - Since the code is just metadata with no malicious or obfuscated elements, a `malware` score of 0 is justified.\n   - The `securityRisk` score is correctly set to 0, as no vulnerabilities are present.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is correctly 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No suspicious assumptions are made; all assessments are consistent with the code content.\n\n6. **Consistency & Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent and reasonable across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No malicious activity or code patterns are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No security risks or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis code snippet is a standard, benign package metadata declaration. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo further action or concern is warranted based on this code.",
