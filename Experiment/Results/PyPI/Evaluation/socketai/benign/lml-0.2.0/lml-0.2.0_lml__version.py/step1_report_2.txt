  "flows": "No data flow between sources and sinks; code only assigns static strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns static string values to two module-level variables indicating version and author. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, and no suspicious patterns. The structure is typical for a Python package's metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
