  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports confirm that the code consists solely of static variable assignments:\n```python\n__version__ = \"0.2.0\"\n__author__ = \"C.W.\"\n```\nThis is standard for package metadata and involves no dynamic behavior, input/output, or external communication.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**  \n- No reports identify any suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for defining package metadata.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \n- No errors or flaws are identified in any report.\n- The logic is sound for its purpose, and no anomalies are detected.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- All reports assign `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, and `securityRisk=0`.\n- These scores are consistent with the analysis: the code is benign, static, and standard.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**  \n- The reports correctly dismiss any assumptions of malicious intent.\n- There are no claims of vulnerabilities based on assumptions.\n\n6. **Risk and Malware Scores**  \n- Since the code is purely metadata with no malicious activity, the scores of 0 for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n- The confidence level is 1 across all reports, reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**  \nThe code is a simple, standard package metadata snippet with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary. The code is benign and poses no security threat.",
