  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nAll reports describe the code as simple variable assignments for `__version__` and `__author__`. The code snippets are minimal, static, and contain no input/output, external data, or dynamic behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**  \nBased on the code, there are no issues present. The code is standard for package metadata.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and typical for package metadata. No logical flaws or errors are evident.\n\n4. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- `malware`: 0\n- `obfuscated`: 0\n- `securityRisk`: 0  \nThese are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification**  \nSince the code is purely static metadata with no external dependencies, no input/output, and no suspicious patterns, the scores of zero are justified. No higher risk scores are warranted.\n\n6. **Claims About Potential Vulnerabilities**  \nThe reports do not claim any vulnerabilities, only that the code is benign. This is correct.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n\nThe code is entirely benign, standard package metadata. No security concerns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is straightforward, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or suspicion is necessary.",
