  "purpose": "Module initialization and logging setup for the 'lml' package, including version info imports and a fallback NullHandler for logging.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal 'lml._version' modules for version and author info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Import of version info → setup of logging with NullHandler fallback.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for backward-compatible logging setup; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initialization script. It imports version and author info from internal modules, which is typical for package metadata. It sets up logging with a fallback NullHandler to prevent warnings in older Python versions. There are no external inputs, network activity, or data processing. The fallback NullHandler is a common pattern and does not introduce security risks. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious constructs are present. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup snippet with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The scores are accurate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
