  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package named 'lml' with basic setup and logging configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports version information from internal modules and sets up a NullHandler for logging.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs module initialization and logging setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and standard for package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a package metadata section, imports version info, and sets up a NullHandler to prevent logging errors if no handlers are configured. It contains a try-except block to define a fallback NullHandler class for compatibility. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to be normal package setup code with no evidence of supply chain attacks or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization snippet with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is well-structured, and its purpose is benign.",
