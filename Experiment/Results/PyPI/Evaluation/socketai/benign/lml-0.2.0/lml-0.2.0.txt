      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a typical plugin framework with no malicious behavior detected. The main security concern is the use of dynamic import without validation, which could be exploited if untrusted modules are loaded. Malware scores are correctly set to 0; obfuscation is absent. A moderate security risk (~0.45) is justified due to reliance on external, unvalidated import paths. Proper validation or sandboxing of imported modules is recommended to mitigate potential risks."

The main security concern is the potential for arbitrary code execution via untrusted input in dynamic imports. The reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. To mitigate risks, input validation should be implemented when using these functions with untrusted data."

Other reports indicate benign or absent code. The scores are consistent with the behaviors described, with the highest concern in report 3. Overall, the dependency does not definitively contain malicious code but requires cautious monitoring."
