  "purpose": "Unit tests for functions 'json_dumps' and 'do_import' in the 'lml.utils' module, and testing 'PluginManager' import.",
  "sources": "Import statements, test functions, mock patches, assertions, and exception handling.",
  "sinks": "None of the code includes data flow to untrusted sinks; no network, file, or sensitive data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified; test functions call imported functions and perform assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. All code appears standard for unit testing.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests for importing modules and serializing objects. It uses standard Python testing libraries such as unittest.mock and pytest. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data theft, or backdoors. The code's purpose is to verify import functionality and exception handling. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign set of unit tests for utility functions related to importing modules and JSON serialization. It shows no evidence of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
