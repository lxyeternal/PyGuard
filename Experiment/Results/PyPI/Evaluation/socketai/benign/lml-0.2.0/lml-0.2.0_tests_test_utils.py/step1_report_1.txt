  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets",
    "Use of mock for exception logging, standard in testing",
    "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed",
    "No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution",
    "Tests do not execute or include code with side effects or malicious actions"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of straightforward unit tests verifying import functions, JSON serialization, and exception handling. No untrusted data sources, network activity, or sensitive data handling are present. The dynamic import functions are standard for plugin systems but could pose risks if module names are manipulated externally; however, within test code, this is controlled. The serialization of a custom class does not indicate malicious intent. The exception logging is for expected error conditions during tests and does not suggest malicious behavior. Overall, the code is standard testing code with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard unit testing of import and serialization functions with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The dynamic import usage is typical for plugin architectures but is safe in this controlled test context.",
