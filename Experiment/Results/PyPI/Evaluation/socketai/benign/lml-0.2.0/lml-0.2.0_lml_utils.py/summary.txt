  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security concern is the potential for arbitrary code execution via untrusted input in dynamic imports. The reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. To mitigate risks, input validation should be implemented when using these functions with untrusted data."
