  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for JSON encoding and dynamic importing of modules and classes",
  "sources": "Input is the parameter 'keywords' in json_dumps, and module/class names in do_import and do_import_class functions",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import of modules and classes, potential for import of malicious modules or classes if input is untrusted",
  "flows": "Input strings for module/class names are used directly in importlib.import_module and getattr, which could load malicious code if input is untrusted",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic. Use of dynamic import functions that depend on external input poses risk if inputs are untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for JSON encoding and dynamic imports. The json_dumps function encodes Python objects to JSON, which is safe and standard. The do_import and do_import_class functions perform dynamic module and class loading based on string inputs. If these inputs are derived from untrusted sources, they can lead to arbitrary code execution by importing malicious modules or classes. The logging is standard; no suspicious or malicious code is present. Overall, the main concern is the use of dynamic imports with untrusted data, which is a potential security risk if not properly validated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily utility functions with safe implementations; however, the dynamic import functions pose a security risk if user-controlled inputs are passed directly without validation. No malware or obfuscation detected. The risk is moderate depending on input validation.",
