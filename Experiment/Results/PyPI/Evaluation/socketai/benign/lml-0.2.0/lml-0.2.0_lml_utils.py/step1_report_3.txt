  "anomalies": "Use of importlib to dynamically import modules and classes without validation, potential for malicious modules or classes to be imported if user input is uncontrolled",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for encoding objects into JSON and dynamically importing modules and classes. The dynamic import functions use input parameters directly for import operations, which could be exploited if inputs are not sanitized. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors. The JSON encoder is benign, merely serializing objects or converting unhandled objects to strings. The logging does not perform network operations or leak data.\nHowever, since the import functions accept arbitrary module names, malicious inputs could lead to importing malicious modules, executing unintended code, or causing runtime errors. No obfuscation or malware signatures are present; the risk depends on external inputs.\nOverall, the code itself is not malicious but could be exploited if user inputs are not controlled.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code performs safe JSON encoding and dynamic importing, but the use of unvalidated input for module and class names introduces potential security risks. No signs of malicious intent or backdoors are detected within this code snippet, but it could be exploited if integrated into a larger system with insecure input handling.",
