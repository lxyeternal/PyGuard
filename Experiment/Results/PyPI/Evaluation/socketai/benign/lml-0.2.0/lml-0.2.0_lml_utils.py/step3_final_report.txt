  "purpose": "Provides JSON serialization with a custom encoder and functions for dynamic import of modules and classes based on string inputs.",
  "sources": "Input strings for module and class names used in do_import, _do_import, and do_import_class functions.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import functions that execute importlib.import_module() and getattr() with external input, potentially leading to code execution if inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "Input strings -> importlib.import_module() / getattr() -> imported modules/classes, which could execute malicious code if inputs are untrusted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or obfuscation; standard patterns used. The main anomaly is the lack of input validation before dynamic import.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward utility functions for JSON encoding and dynamic importing. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The primary security concern is the use of unvalidated external input in import functions, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited. The reports correctly identify this risk and assign moderate risk scores (~0.4), consistent with the potential for misuse. Malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The overall security posture is safe in itself but requires cautious use with validated inputs to prevent security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security concern is the potential for arbitrary code execution via untrusted input in dynamic imports. The reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. To mitigate risks, input validation should be implemented when using these functions with untrusted data.",
