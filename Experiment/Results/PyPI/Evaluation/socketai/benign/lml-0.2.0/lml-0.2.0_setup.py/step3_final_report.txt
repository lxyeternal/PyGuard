  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging and publishing a Python project, with optional GitHub release automation.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, files for long description, and executes system commands for build, upload, and release.",
  "sinks": "os.system() calls executing static build, upload, and release commands; file reading functions.",
  "flows": "User invokes setup commands; script runs build/upload commands; optional 'gease' dependency for releases.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() with static commands; no user input influence; no secrets or network activity; benign optional dependency.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py with functions for reading files, filtering test code, and executing build/publish commands. No malicious or obfuscated code detected. The use of os.system() is standard but could be risky if inputs are compromised; here, commands are static. No hardcoded secrets or network activity. The optional 'gease' dependency is benign. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the controlled use of system commands. Overall, the script is safe and standard for packaging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup.py script with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from executing static system commands, which is typical in such scripts. The assigned scores are accurate and justified.",
