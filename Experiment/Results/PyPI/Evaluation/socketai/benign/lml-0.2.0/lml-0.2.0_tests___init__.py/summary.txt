  "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate suspicion in reports 3 and 5 due to obfuscation and network activity, warranting further detailed code review. Other reports indicate benign or absent code. The scores are consistent with the behaviors described, with the highest concern in report 3. Overall, the dependency does not definitively contain malicious code but requires cautious monitoring."
