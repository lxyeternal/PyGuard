  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The environment detection logic is routine and does not introduce vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a very low risk score, are appropriate and justified."
