  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; code is standard setup with environment detection.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; the logic is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation. The environment checks are typical.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; standard setup code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; the code is typical for package setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; standard setup script.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; similar to previous reports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; standard setup with a custom build class.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; the custom build class adjusts compiler for Windows Python 2.7, which is a known compatibility fix.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior; environment detection is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; typical setup with minor environment-specific customization.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; the logic is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — slightly above zero but very low.\n- **Justification:** The slight risk score reflects minimal environment detection logic, which is common and not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Acceptable, but perhaps a tiny bit conservative; no change necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. I agree with 0 for all.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All are very low, reflecting standard setup scripts with environment detection, which is typical and not risky.\n\n### Final recommendation:\nGiven the analysis, I would assign the following scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk:** 0 for all, since these are standard setup scripts with no suspicious behavior.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a typical, benign setup configuration script.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Note:** No further action needed; the code is safe based on the provided information.",
