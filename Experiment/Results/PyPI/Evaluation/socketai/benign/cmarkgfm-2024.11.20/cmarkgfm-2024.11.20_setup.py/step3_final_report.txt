  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for a Python package, including environment detection and build customization.",
  "sources": "Reading README file, platform.system(), sys.version_info, environment variables for build options.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network activity or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Environment detection influences build_ext configuration; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns; environment detection is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads a README file, detects platform and Python version to adjust build options, and configures package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The custom build_ext class adjusts the compiler for Windows Python 2.7, which is a known compatibility fix. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The environment detection logic is routine and does not introduce vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a very low risk score, are appropriate and justified.",
