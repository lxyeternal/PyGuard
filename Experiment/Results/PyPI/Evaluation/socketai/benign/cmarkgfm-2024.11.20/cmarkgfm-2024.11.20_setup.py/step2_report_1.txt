  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no malicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows.\n- The code only reads a README file, detects platform and Python version, and configures build options accordingly.\n- The custom build_ext class modifies the compiler for Windows Python 2.7 environments, which is a common compatibility adjustment.\n- No network activity, external code execution, or data exfiltration is present.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- Security risk scores are very low or zero, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors.\n- The environment detection and build customization are standard practices.\n- No suspicious patterns or behaviors are identified.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0 is correct.\n- Risk: Given the benign nature, a very low risk score (around 0.1) in the last report seems reasonable, but overall, the risk is minimal.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- No issues are detected that would warrant higher scores.\n- The reports' reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- All reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just acknowledging the environment detection and build customization, but no real security concern)\n\nThis is a benign setup script, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
