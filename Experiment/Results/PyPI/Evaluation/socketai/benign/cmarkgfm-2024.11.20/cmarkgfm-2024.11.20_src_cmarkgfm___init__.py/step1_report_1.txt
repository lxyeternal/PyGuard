  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is primarily import/export definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs present",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions related to markdown-to-HTML conversion and an options class. It then defines __all__ to specify exported symbols. There are no data inputs, outputs, or complex logic. The code appears to be a straightforward module interface definition without malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import and export declaration with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
