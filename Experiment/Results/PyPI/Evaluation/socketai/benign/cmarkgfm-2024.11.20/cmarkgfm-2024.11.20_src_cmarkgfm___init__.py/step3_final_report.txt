  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific functions and classes from the 'cmarkgfm.cmark' library for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'cmarkgfm.cmark' module.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow, input, or output handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static import and export only.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export pattern with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static imports from an external library and defines '__all__' for public API exposure. It contains no data processing, dynamic execution, or handling of untrusted data. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or obfuscation are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate benign intent, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module interface declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
