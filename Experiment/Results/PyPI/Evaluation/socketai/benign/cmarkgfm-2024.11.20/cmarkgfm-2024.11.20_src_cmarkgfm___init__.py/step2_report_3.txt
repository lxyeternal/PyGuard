  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the associated reports carefully.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code is a straightforward import and export declaration. It imports specific functions and a class from the 'cmarkgfm.cmark' module and defines `__all__` for public API exposure.\n- There are no signs of data processing, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or data manipulation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a simple interface layer, with no suspicious activity.\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n- The reports correctly note the absence of data flows, anomalies, or malicious intent.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the scores are reasonable.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- Since the code is purely import/export with no data processing or external interactions, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n- The code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n- Therefore, a risk score of 0 or very close to 0 is justified.\n\n**5. Malware Score Reflection:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they only describe the code's behavior.\n- No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n- No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple module interface declaration with no data processing, external communication, or suspicious constructs. It is a benign pattern commonly used in Python projects.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this code is safe, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
