  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Overview:**\nThe code is a straightforward Python module that imports specific functions and a class from the 'cmarkgfm.cmark' library and defines the `__all__` list to specify the public API. There are no data flows, no input/output handling, no dynamic execution, and no apparent malicious or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports agree that the code is a simple interface declaration with no malicious or security-related concerns.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or structural errors:** None. The code is correct for its purpose.\n- **Security flaws or suspicious constructs:** None. The code only performs static imports and exports.\n\n### Scores and Their Reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of security issues.\n\n### Justification for Scores > 0.5:\n- Since there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks, scores above 0.5 are unjustified.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:\n- The reports correctly do not assume vulnerabilities where none are evident.\n- The code depends on an external library ('cmarkgfm.cmark'), but there's no indication that this library is compromised or malicious.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a minimal, static module interface declaration with no data processing, no input/output, and no suspicious behavior. It is safe and standard practice in Python modules.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. They correctly identify that this code snippet is benign and serves only as an interface layer for an external library. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and the absence of any malicious or security concerns.",
