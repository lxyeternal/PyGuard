{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions and classes from the 'cmarkgfm.cmark' module and defines the module's public interface.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'cmarkgfm.cmark', which loads functions and classes from an external library.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only performs imports and defines '__all__'.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code does not process any data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and standard for defining module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and a class from an external markdown processing library and sets the '__all__' variable to specify what is publicly available. It does not perform any data processing, I/O, or malicious actions. The usage appears typical for Python modules exposing selected functions. No hidden or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for re-exporting selected functions from an external library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
