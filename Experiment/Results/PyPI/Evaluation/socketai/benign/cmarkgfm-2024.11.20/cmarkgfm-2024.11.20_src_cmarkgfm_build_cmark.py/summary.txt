  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign build process with no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and no security risks. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report slightly overstates potential concern but remains very low. Overall, all reports correctly assess the code as safe and free of malicious activity."
