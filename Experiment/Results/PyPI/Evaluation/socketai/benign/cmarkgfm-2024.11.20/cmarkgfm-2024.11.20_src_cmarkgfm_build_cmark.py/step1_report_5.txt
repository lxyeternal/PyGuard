  "purpose": "This script configures and compiles C source files for a Python package using cffi, primarily to generate bindings for a C library (cmark).",
  "sources": "Reads files 'cmark.cffi.h' and 'cmark_module.h' from the local directory; uses glob to find C source files in specific directories.",
  "sinks": "Uses the cffi library to compile C code into Python extensions; reads source files; generates a compiled module.",
  "flows": "Reads header files -> gathers C source files -> configures cffi build -> compiles the module.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard build configuration and compilation tasks. No network activity, file system manipulation, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads header files and C source files from specific directories, then uses cffi to build a Python extension module. It dynamically determines compiler type and sets compilation flags accordingly. No untrusted input is processed, no network operations or suspicious logic is present. The code is structured as a standard build script, with no anomalies or malicious intent observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard build configuration script for compiling C code into a Python extension using cffi. It performs no malicious actions, has no hardcoded secrets or backdoors, and follows typical patterns for such tasks. The likelihood of malicious behavior is very low.",
