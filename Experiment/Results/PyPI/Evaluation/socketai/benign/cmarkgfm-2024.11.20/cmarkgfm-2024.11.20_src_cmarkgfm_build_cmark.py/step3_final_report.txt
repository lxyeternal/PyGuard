  "purpose": "Build script for generating CFFI bindings for the 'cmark' library, reading header files, collecting source files, determining compiler type, and compiling the extension.",
  "sources": "Reading local header files (cmark.cffi.h, cmark_module.h), collecting source files (*.c) from specified directories, system compiler info via distutils.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script performs static file reads and compilation without external inputs or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads header files and source files, determines compiler type, sets compile args, and invokes cffi compile process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard build setup for a Python C extension using cffi. It reads static header files, gathers source files, detects system compiler type, and compiles the extension accordingly. No external data, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or very close) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign build process with no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and no security risks. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report slightly overstates potential concern but remains very low. Overall, all reports correctly assess the code as safe and free of malicious activity.",
