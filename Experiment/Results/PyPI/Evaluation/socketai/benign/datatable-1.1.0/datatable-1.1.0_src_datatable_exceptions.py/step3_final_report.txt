{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes, traceback formatting, and warning handling to improve error reporting and debugging readability.",
  "sources": "Reads data from internal exception messages, traceback frames, and warning messages; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted traceback and warning messages to stderr; no data flows into external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "Exception or warning message sources flow into formatted output functions, which then print to stderr.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The traceback formatting includes path shortening and repeated line suppression, which are standard debugging features.",
  "analysis": "The code provides enhanced error and warning display with colorized output, custom exception classes, and traceback formatting. It relies solely on standard modules and a local color formatting function. There are no external data flows, network activity, or code injection. The purpose is purely for debugging and error readability. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with typical debugging utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, utility module for exception and warning formatting with no malicious or security-threatening features. It does not perform any unsafe operations or external communications. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, reflecting minimal risk primarily related to potential information leakage via traceback output, which is typical for debugging tools.",
