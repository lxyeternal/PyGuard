{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception and warning classes, handles exceptions and warnings, and provides enhanced traceback formatting for a data table library.",
  "sources": "Imports from builtins, sys, traceback, warnings, and a local module .lib._datatable apply_color function.",
  "sinks": "None evident. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause harm.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data source is connected to any sink. Exception messages are formatted for display but do not leak sensitive info or execute code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is primarily for error handling and user notifications.",
  "analysis": "The script provides custom exception classes inheriting from standard exceptions, with enhanced string representations. It also customizes the exception hook (_handle_dt_exception) to format tracebacks with colored output, especially marking site-packages paths and repeated frames to improve readability. Warnings are also customized to display in color. The code appears to be purely for debugging, logging, and user interface purposes. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. All modules and functions used are for standard error handling and display, with no external or dangerous behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for exception and warning formatting, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain malicious code segments.",
