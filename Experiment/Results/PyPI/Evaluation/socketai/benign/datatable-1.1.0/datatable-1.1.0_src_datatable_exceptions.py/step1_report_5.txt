{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exceptions, error handling, and warning handling for a data processing library, likely related to the 'datatable' package, including traceback formatting and colored output for debugging and user notifications.",
  "sources": "Input sources include exception messages, traceback frames, and warnings; specifically, error messages and traceback data collected during exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if exception messages or traceback information are exposed externally, especially if they include sensitive details, but this code only formats and prints errors internally.",
  "flows": "Error messages and traceback data flow from exception occurrences to formatted output via custom exception handling functions and warning handlers; no external network or file I/O occurs in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily deals with exception and warning formatting, with no obvious hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. No code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes inheriting from standard exceptions, with detailed traceback formatting that includes color coding for enhanced readability. Exception handling functions process traceback frames, selectively abbreviate repeated lines, and format messages with backtick emphasis. Warning handling similarly customizes warning output. No external network access, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. The focus is on debugging and user notification mechanisms, which are standard for error handling libraries.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate debugging and exception formatting utility for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It enhances error readability but does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.",
