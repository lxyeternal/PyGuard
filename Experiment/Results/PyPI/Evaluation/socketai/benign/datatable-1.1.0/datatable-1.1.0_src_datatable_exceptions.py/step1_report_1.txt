{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception and warning classes, exception handling, and traceback formatting for a data table library, with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Imports from built-in modules (builtins, sys, traceback, warnings), and a local module (.lib._datatable.apply_color). No external data sources or inputs are directly read from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident where untrusted data is used insecurely. The code formats and prints traceback and exception information to standard error, which is a typical behavior.",
  "flows": "Exception occurs -> custom traceback formatting -> output to stderr; no untrusted data flows into system commands, network, or file system.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs complex traceback processing, including color formatting and handling repeated lines; no suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes custom exception classes for handling exceptions in a specialized way, including detailed traceback printing with formatting. It overrides sys.excepthook and warnings.showwarning to provide customized error/warning outputs. All operations are related to exception and warning handling, with no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious activities. The code is self-contained and uses standard practices for error reporting. No suspicious external communications, dynamic code execution, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign library component focused on custom error handling and traceback formatting, with no signs of malware or malicious activity. Its functions are aligned with improving developer debugging experience without exposing security risks.",
