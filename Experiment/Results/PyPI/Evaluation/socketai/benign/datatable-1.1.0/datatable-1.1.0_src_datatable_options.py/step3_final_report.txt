{
  "purpose": "The code implements a configuration management system for the datatable library, allowing registration, retrieval, and modification of options with support for nested configurations.",
  "sources": "Internal data structures within the Config class, such as self._options and self._prefix; no external untrusted input is processed.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; the code does not send data over the network, write to files, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Configuration options are set and retrieved via internal methods; no external data flows or untrusted input to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code manages configuration options with nested support, using internal dictionaries and attributes. It performs standard operations such as registration, access, modification, and resetting options. No external input handling, network communication, or code execution occurs. The use of fuzzy matching is benign, serving user convenience. The code's structure and logic are typical for configuration management modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration management utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe implementation suitable for supply chain use.",
