  "purpose": "Utility functions for data comparison, representation, and random data generation, primarily for testing and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Internal data structures and parameters passed to functions; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; no network, file, or environment variable interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows are confined within function calls and data manipulations; no external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of extensive random data generation and verbose logging, but these are typical for testing utilities; no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for data frame comparison, data representation, and random data generation. It imports standard libraries and a local module for data integrity checks. There are no network operations, external data handling, or obfuscation. The functions are designed for testing, debugging, and data validation. The use of randomness and assertions aligns with testing utilities. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The 'traced' decorator logs function calls, which could leak info but is not malicious. The overall structure and content indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign utility functions used for data validation and testing. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
