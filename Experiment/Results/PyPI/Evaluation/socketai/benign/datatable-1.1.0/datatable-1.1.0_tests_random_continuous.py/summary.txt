  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard testing utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), no obfuscation (0), and very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate. It functions as a controlled harness for executing 'single.py' with different seeds, with no signs of sabotage or malicious activity."
