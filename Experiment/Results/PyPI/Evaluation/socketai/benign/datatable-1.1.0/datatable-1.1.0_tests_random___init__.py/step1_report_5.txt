  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing and possibly network communication, but the exact purpose cannot be determined from the fragment provided.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables and possibly external files or network sources (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network sockets or system commands if present; specific sinks are not explicitly shown in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables/files) to processing functions and possibly to network or system outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious function calls, are detected in the provided fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library functions and appears to perform typical data processing tasks. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or network communication with suspicious domains. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs are identified. The absence of specific suspicious activity in the fragment suggests normal operation, but incomplete context limits certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no obvious malware or supply chain vulnerabilities. However, full assessment is limited by the partial view of the code.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
