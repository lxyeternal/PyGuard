  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed appear benign, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate given the limited context. Minor adjustments to risk scores could be considered to reflect inherent uncertainty, but current scores are reasonable. Overall, the dependency is deemed safe based on the available information."
