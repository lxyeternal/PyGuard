  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential data inputs such as network connections, file reads, environment variables, or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Data transmission over network, file modifications, environment variable access, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks, e.g., data read from input flows into network transmission or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "Any unusual code constructs, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation patterns.",
  "analysis": "The provided reports consistently indicate minimal or no code, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. Scores for malware and obfuscation are zero across all reports, aligning with their descriptions. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting cautious uncertainty due to limited context. Confidence levels are high where code is present, and zero where code is absent. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified. The assessments are internally consistent and justified by the descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed appear benign, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate given the limited context. Minor adjustments to risk scores could be considered to reflect inherent uncertainty, but current scores are reasonable. Overall, the dependency is deemed safe based on the available information.",
