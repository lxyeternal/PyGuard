  "purpose": "This code appears to serve as an import and export interface for functions and classes from the 'datatable.lib._datatable' module, likely to be used in data processing or modeling tasks.",
  "sources": "The code imports specific functions and classes from 'datatable.lib._datatable', which is a local or third-party library. No external or untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code. There are no data leaks, system calls, network communications, or other side effects.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present, as the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python module that imports specific functions and classes from a local or external library 'datatable.lib._datatable'. It declares an '__all__' list for explicit exports. There is no user input, no dynamic execution, or security-sensitive operations. The license comments are standard and do not pose any risk. The code structure is simple, and no obfuscation or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup that imports and exposes functions/classes from a library without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical interface file with no signs of malware or security issues.",
