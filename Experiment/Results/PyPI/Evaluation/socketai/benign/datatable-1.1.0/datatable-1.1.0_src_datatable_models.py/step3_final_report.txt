  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports specific functions and classes from an internal library and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the imported module 'datatable.lib._datatable'.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the imported module to the module's namespace, with no external data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard import statements and a license comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple API exposure module, importing specific functions/classes and defining __all__. It contains no dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The license comments are standard. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module exposing functions/classes from an internal library with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores are appropriate; no modifications are necessary.",
