{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define an interface for a data processing or machine learning library, exporting certain functions and classes from an internal module.",
  "sources": "The code reads only from imported modules and the __all__ variable for exporting symbols.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that process untrusted input, nor any network or system calls.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive functions is observed in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, importing specific functions and classes, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from an internal module within the 'datatable.lib' package. It then explicitly exports these symbols via __all__, which is a common pattern in Python for defining public API. There are no inputs, no execution of untrusted data, and no suspicious behaviors such as dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage. The code is clean, minimal, and aligns with typical package setup or API exposure patterns. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues based on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a module interface, exposing selected functions/classes from an internal library. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and intended for legitimate library use.",
