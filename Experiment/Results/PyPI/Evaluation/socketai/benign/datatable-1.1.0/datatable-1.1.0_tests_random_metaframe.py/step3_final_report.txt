  "purpose": "Provides a data utility class for generating, loading, saving, and validating data frames using the datatable library.",
  "sources": "File input via dt.fread, data generation functions, and internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "File output via to_jay, data stored in internal structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file or generated data into internal structures, then potentially to output files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; print statements for debugging are present but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data utility class with functions for creating, validating, and managing data frames. It performs standard file I/O, data validation, and name deduplication. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The print statements are typical debugging aids. The validation functions ensure data integrity without security risks. Overall, the code is clean, well-structured, and aligns with safe data handling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data utility module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the analysis: malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1-0.2). It is safe for supply chain use.",
