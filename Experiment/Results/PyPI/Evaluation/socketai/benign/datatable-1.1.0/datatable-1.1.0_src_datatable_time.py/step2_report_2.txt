  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content**:\n   - The code is a standard Python header with licensing information.\n   - It performs a simple import of several functions from a local module: `.lib._datatable`.\n   - There are no executable statements, data processing, network activity, or other behaviors.\n   - The import path suggests it is part of a larger package or module.\n\n2. **Review of Reports**:\n   - All five reports agree that the code is a straightforward import statement.\n   - They note the use of relative imports from a local module, likely related to date/time processing.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - No data flows, input/output operations, or network interactions are present.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and all reports conclude the code is benign.\n\n3. **Assessment of Maliciousness and Risks**:\n   - Since the code only imports functions from a local module, there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n   - The absence of any dynamic code execution, network calls, or data handling reduces the risk.\n   - The import path `.lib._datatable` is typical for internal modules within a package.\n   - The license is permissive, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are visible.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Risk Score**: Given the lack of any security issues, a score of 0 or very close to it is justified.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The code is a benign, standard import statement.\n   - No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code fragment is safe and does not pose any security risk. The reports are accurate in their assessments.",
