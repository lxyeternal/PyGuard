{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import specific functions from a local module within a larger package, likely related to date/time processing or data handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from the relative module '.lib._datatable'. No other input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs, such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications, are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements without any executable logic. The use of relative imports suggests it is part of a package. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical import statement section of a Python package, importing various functions likely related to date/time components. No input reading, data processing, or output generation occurs here. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks within this fragment. It appears to be a legitimate part of a package's internal structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import block for a Python package module, with no signs of malware or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
