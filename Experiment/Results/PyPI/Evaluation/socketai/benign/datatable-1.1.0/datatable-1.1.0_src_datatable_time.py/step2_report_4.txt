  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Analysis:**\n   - The code consists solely of import statements from a local module (`.lib._datatable`), importing functions related to date/time components.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code appears to be part of a larger package, likely internal, given the relative import path.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are visible.\n\n2. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward import statement with no suspicious behavior.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and the assessments are consistent across reports.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks are identified.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or other potentially risky operations.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward import statements.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Overestimations:**\n   - The code is minimal and benign; no changes are necessary.\n   - The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior; they are accurate.\n   - Since the code is just an import, the risk scores are correctly low.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, harmless import statement.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n   - No further action or escalation is needed.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified.\n- The reports are accurate in their reasoning.\n- No additional risks or malicious activity are evident.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code fragment is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
