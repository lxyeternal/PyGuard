  "purpose": "Import specific functions from a local module within the package, likely for data manipulation or processing.",
  "sources": "The code imports from a relative module path '.lib._datatable'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data interactions are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows involving untrusted sources in this fragment; it's purely an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import with a potentially private or internal module, but no unusual or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard header with licensing information followed by a simple import statement from a relative module path. No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The import appears to be for data-related functions, consistent with a library or package for data processing. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
