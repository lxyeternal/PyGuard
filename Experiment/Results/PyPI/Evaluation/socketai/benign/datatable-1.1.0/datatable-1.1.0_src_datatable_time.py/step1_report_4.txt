{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions from a local library module, likely related to date and time processing.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident as the code only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The import path uses a relative import from a local library (.lib._datatable), which is common but not suspicious by itself. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard header with licensing information followed by an import statement for various date and time-related functions from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network access, data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscated logic. The import is from a local relative path, indicating it is part of a larger package or module. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present. The license appears to be a permissive open-source license, and the code appears to be legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward import statement for date/time functions from a local module, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be part of a larger, benign project.",
