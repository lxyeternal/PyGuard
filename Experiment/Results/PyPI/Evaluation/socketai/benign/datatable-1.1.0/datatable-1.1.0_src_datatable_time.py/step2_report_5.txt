  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code fragment step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nThe code is solely a set of import statements from a local module `.lib._datatable`, importing functions related to date/time components. There is no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**  \n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution.\n- The import path is a relative internal module, typical in a package structure.\n- The code is a standard import block, with a permissive license header.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**  \nAll reports agree that this is a benign, standard import statement with no suspicious behavior. They note the use of relative imports, typical in package code, and confirm the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward import statements.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the lack of vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Inconsistencies**  \n- The reports do not suggest any issues with the code snippet.\n- The code is minimal and standard, so scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**  \n- Since the code is only import statements, it cannot be malicious or vulnerable on its own.\n- The actual security posture depends on the contents of `.lib._datatable`, but that is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no vulnerabilities or security risks identified)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code fragment is a benign, standard import statement with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Confirmed absence of issues in the code.  \n- No need to adjust scores; they are consistent with the code's nature.  \n- No further action required based on this snippet.",
