  "purpose": "Import date/time functions from a local module, likely for internal data processing or manipulation.",
  "sources": "The import statements from the relative module `.lib._datatable`",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; only internal import statements",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data sources to sinks; purely static import",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import statements with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a local module, with no executable logic, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with high confidence, and assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The import path is typical for internal package structure, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign import statement with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the current low scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
