  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the security implications.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a straightforward utility module for mathematical functions and constants.\n- No external or untrusted data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The import is from a relative module, which suggests modular design but not malicious intent.\n- The constants are standard mathematical values.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or signs of malware are detected.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), and all reports conclude benign intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is simple, importing functions and defining constants, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware presence:** None of the reports find any malware activity or malicious code.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risks:** None identified; no external data handling, no code injection, no secrets.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The import from `.lib._datatable` is a local module, which is typical for modular libraries. No issues there.\n- The constants are standard and do not pose any security concern.\n- The code does not process user input, perform network operations, or write to files.\n\n### Scoring and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the evidence, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is benign, standard for a math utility library, and contains no malicious or security-threatening behavior.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign setup module for mathematical functions and constants, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence and consistent reports support this conclusion.",
