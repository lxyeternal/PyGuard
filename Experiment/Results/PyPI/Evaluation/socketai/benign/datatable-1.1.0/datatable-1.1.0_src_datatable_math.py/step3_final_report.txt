{
  "purpose": "Provides mathematical functions and constants for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module '.lib._datatable' and the definitions of constants (e, golden, pi, tau, nan, inf).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; constants are predefined, and no external input handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only imports functions and defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import and constant definitions with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a set of mathematical functions from a local module, which appears to be a utility library. It then defines several mathematical constants. There are no data inputs, external communications, or dynamic code execution. The structure is simple, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The constants are standard mathematical values, and the imported functions are typical for mathematical computations. The code's purpose is likely to provide these functions and constants for other parts of the software. Given the absence of any suspicious activity, data leaks, or malicious code, the overall security posture is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for mathematical functions and constants, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
