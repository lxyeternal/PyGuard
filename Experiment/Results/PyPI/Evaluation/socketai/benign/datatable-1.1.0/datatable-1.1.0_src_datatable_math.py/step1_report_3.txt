{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define mathematical functions and constants, likely as part of a larger library or module related to data processing or scientific computation.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading sources are present in this code fragment.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data handling points, no network operations, file writes, or sensitive data processing.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports functions and defines constants without any data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only standard mathematical imports and constant definitions with no obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets beyond mathematical constants.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numerous mathematical functions from a local module (.lib._datatable) and defines some mathematical constants. It appears to be a part of a larger math or data analysis library. There are no input sources, no data transformations, or security-sensitive operations. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are evident. The import pattern and constants are typical for such libraries.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward mathematical utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a standard library component, and no malicious or suspicious activities are detected.",
