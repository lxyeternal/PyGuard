{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define mathematical functions and constants, likely as part of a larger library or package for numerical computations.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module 'lib._datatable' for importing functions and defines constants (e, golden ratio, pi, tau, nan, inf).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data outputs are present; the code only imports functions and sets constants.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code mainly sets up imports and constants without processing untrusted input or executing external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The import from a relative module suggests modular design but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a comprehensive set of mathematical functions from a relative module, likely part of a larger package. It also defines mathematical constants like e, the golden ratio, pi, tau, and special float values (nan, inf). There are no external data inputs, no data processing, or network activities. The structure is straightforward and typical for a math utility module. No obfuscated code, no suspicious logic, and no indication of malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard mathematical setup for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely imports functions and defines constants, which is common in scientific or numerical libraries.",
