  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The code is a straightforward module that imports mathematical functions from a local module and defines some constants. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data leaks. The code does not process user input, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. The constants are standard mathematical values.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0. These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports suggest any malicious activity or security risk that would warrant a higher score. The code is purely a utility setup for mathematical functions.\n\n5. **Malware score reflection:**  \n   The malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis that there is no malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions. They base their conclusions on the absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external interactions.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis, all indicating no risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal, if any, residual concern, but practically zero)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign utility module for mathematical functions and constants. There is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk present.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Given the evidence, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to acknowledge that it's a utility module with no security issues)\n\nThese scores are consistent with the reports and the code's content.",
