  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code imports mathematical functions and defines constants, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound, and the scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly states that the code is a standard utility module with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent and justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is straightforward, importing functions and defining constants without any suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; the code appears benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risk:** None indicated.\n- **Malware score justification:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, import statements are clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard utility module for mathematical functions/constants, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.",
