{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up mathematical functions and constants, likely as part of a larger data processing or mathematical computation library.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .lib._datatable importing numerous math functions, and assignment of mathematical constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or data sources are evident; no sinks such as network, file, or environment variable access are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code solely defines constants and imports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are observed. The import path suggests a local or packaged module structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple mathematical functions from a local module (.lib._datatable) and defines common mathematical constants. It appears to be a setup or utility module without any dynamic or malicious operations. There are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or other malicious activities. The structure and content are consistent with legitimate mathematical library code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup module that provides mathematical functions and constants. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
