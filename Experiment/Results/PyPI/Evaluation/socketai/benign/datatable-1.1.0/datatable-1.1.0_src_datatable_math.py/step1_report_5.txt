{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define mathematical functions and constants, likely to be used in a larger data processing or analysis library.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.lib._datatable' that provide mathematical functions and constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external input handling present; constants are hardcoded.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up imports and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, or hidden functionality observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various mathematical functions from a local module, which suggests it is part of a library focused on data manipulation or mathematical computations. The constants defined are standard mathematical constants. There are no signs of malicious activities such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical data science or mathematical library setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, functioning to import mathematical functions and define constants. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present.",
