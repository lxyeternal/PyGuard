  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a benign setup module importing math functions and defining constants. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent is detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes the code as a standard mathematical utility module with no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious code, no external data handling, no anomalies.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, it describes the code as a straightforward mathematical setup with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is identified as a benign utility module, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: a standard mathematical functions and constants setup, no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, benign setup module for mathematical functions/constants.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Note:** Since the code is purely import statements and constant definitions with no dynamic or external interactions, these scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No changes are necessary. The code is a benign utility module with no security concerns.",
