{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define mathematical functions and constants, likely for use in data analysis or scientific computation, as part of a larger software package.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from a relative module '.lib._datatable'. It also defines constants like e, golden ratio, pi, tau, nan, and inf.",
  "sinks": "No clear sink points are present. The code does not process user input or untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up constants and imports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated constructs are present. The import statements are straightforward, and constants are assigned standard mathematical values.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a set of mathematical functions from a relative module, suggesting modular design. It defines standard mathematical constants. The copyright and licensing comments are standard, with no embedded code or malicious content. No user input handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing is present. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup for mathematical computations with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a utility module within a larger project.",
