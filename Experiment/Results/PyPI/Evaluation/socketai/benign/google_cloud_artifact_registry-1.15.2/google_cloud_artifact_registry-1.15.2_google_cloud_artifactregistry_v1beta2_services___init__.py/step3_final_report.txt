  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is purely comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments with no executable code, data handling, or network activity. All reviews correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. The confidence level is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious features are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign license header with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores are accurate and should remain as-is.",
