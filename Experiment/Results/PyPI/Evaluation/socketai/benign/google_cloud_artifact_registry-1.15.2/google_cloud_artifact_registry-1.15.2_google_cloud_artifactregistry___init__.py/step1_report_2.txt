{
  "purpose": "The code imports and re-exports various modules and classes related to Google Cloud Artifact Registry API, providing a centralized access point for interacting with artifact registry resources.",
  "sources": "Import statements from google.cloud.artifactregistry_v1 and related submodules, and the __version__ assignment from package_version.",
  "sinks": "None of the imports or assignments involve handling untrusted data or user input. No code writes data to external systems or network connections.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely imports modules and sets a version variable.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard SDK import module with no obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily composed of import statements, type definitions, and an __all__ declaration to specify public API exports. It adheres to standard Python module practices for SDK packaging. There are no dynamic code executions, network communications, or data processing that could pose security threats. No anomalies, malicious patterns, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical SDK module designed for exposing Google Cloud Artifact Registry API components. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears safe and benign.",
