{
  "purpose": "This code provides import statements and module exports for the Google Cloud Artifact Registry client library, facilitating access to various artifact management services and data types.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.cloud.artifactregistry and related submodules, including version info, service clients, and data type classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in the code; it does not process or output untrusted data or perform external network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely import/export declarations without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward and primarily consists of import statements and module exports. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module that imports various classes and functions from the Google Cloud Artifact Registry SDK. It sets the __all__ attribute for module exports. There are no runtime behaviors, data processing, or external interactions. The presence of only import statements and variable declarations indicates a configuration or library interface setup, with no malicious logic or code execution present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard SDK module initialization file with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply imports and re-exports components of the Google Cloud Artifact Registry library.",
