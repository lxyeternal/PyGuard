  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code is an interface for Google Cloud's Artifact Registry SDK, importing classes and types.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data handling or external data processing occurs; the code is purely declarative.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The code is standard SDK setup.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that this code is benign and purely for SDK exports is accurate, with high confidence (1). No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is an import module for SDK components, with no data processing or external interactions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is standard, safe, and not malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 1, appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the import/export nature of the code, no runtime data handling, no anomalies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The assessment that this is a benign SDK module is accurate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates that the code is an import module, with no data flows or suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct, safe, and standard.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Summarizes that the code is a collection of imports and type definitions, with no data processing or malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate and consistent with the code's purpose.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior?** No. All reports agree that this is a standard SDK interface module with no dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions.\n- **Obfuscation?** None detected.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?** None, as the code only imports and exports classes/types.\n\n### Scores Justification:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, import/export statements only.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk, as the code is purely declarative and SDK setup.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** This code is a benign, standard SDK module setup with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk.",
