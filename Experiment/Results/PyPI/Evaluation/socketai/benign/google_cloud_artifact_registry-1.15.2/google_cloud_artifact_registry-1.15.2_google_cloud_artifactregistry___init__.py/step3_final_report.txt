{
  "purpose": "This code module imports various classes, types, and functions from the Google Cloud Artifact Registry SDK and re-exports them via __all__, serving as an interface for SDK components.",
  "sources": "Import statements from google.cloud.artifactregistry_v1 modules, including classes, types, and functions related to artifacts, repositories, tags, versions, and settings.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, network operations, or data leaks; purely static import and export statements.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; the code only establishes namespace exports for SDK components.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ list, with a license header. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic execution. The structure is typical for an SDK interface module, intended to expose classes and types for client use. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module that exports classes and types from the Google Cloud Artifact Registry SDK. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and the scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk should all be zero.",
