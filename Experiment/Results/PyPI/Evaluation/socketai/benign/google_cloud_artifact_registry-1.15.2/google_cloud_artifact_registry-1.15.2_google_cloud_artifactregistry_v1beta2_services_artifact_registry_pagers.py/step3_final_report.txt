  "purpose": "Utility classes for paginating through Google Cloud Artifact Registry API responses, including repositories, packages, versions, files, and tags, both synchronously and asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Response objects from API calls, specifically fields like repositories, packages, versions, files, and tags within the response objects.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data exfiltration points; the code only iterates over API response data.",
  "flows": "Iterates over response objects, checking for next_page_token, and yields resource items; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs; standard API pagination pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard pagination classes for Google Cloud API responses, handling next_page_token to fetch subsequent pages. It uses straightforward iteration and async patterns without any dynamic code execution, network operations outside API calls, or data leaks. The structure and logic are typical for client library utilities. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard API response pagination utilities with no malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and very low risk are appropriate and justified.",
