  "purpose": "This code serves as a standard license header and version identifier for a Python package, providing metadata about the software's licensing and versioning.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only contains comments and a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code is static metadata with no source-to-sink pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version string assignment, with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign boilerplate. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, which is appropriate given the content. The confidence level is high (1.0), as the code is simple and unambiguous. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard license header with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
