  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; only static comments and variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code contains only comments and a version variable.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of licensing comments is normal; no unusual or suspicious code constructs. The version string appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only license headers, copyright notices, and a version variable assignment. There are no function definitions, data inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical metadata header for a Python package, containing licensing and version info. It appears benign with no malicious intent or security issues.",
