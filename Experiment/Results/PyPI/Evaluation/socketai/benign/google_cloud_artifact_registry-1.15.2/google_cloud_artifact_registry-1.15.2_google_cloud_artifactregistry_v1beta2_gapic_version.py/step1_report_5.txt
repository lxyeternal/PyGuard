{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a license and version declaration for a Python module, likely part of an open-source project.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, user input, or untrusted data are read in this snippet.",
  "targets": "No sinks that handle untrusted data, perform I/O, or execute code based on external input are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists, as the code only contains comments and a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard licensing and versioning comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely informational, containing licensing information, copyright, license link, and a version declaration. It does not include any executable logic, data handling, or potentially malicious constructs. The absence of dynamic code execution, data processing, or network activity suggests a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard license header with a version declaration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and typical for an open-source Python module.",
