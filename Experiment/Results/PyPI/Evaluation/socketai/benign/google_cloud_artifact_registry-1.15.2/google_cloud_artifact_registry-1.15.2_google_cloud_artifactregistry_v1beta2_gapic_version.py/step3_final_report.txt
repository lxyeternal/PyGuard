{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a metadata header for a Python package, containing licensing information and a version identifier.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__ = \"1.15.2\"' and comments containing licensing details.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors; static comments and a variable assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is straightforward metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version variable assignment, with no executable logic or data handling. No sources or sinks are present, and there are no suspicious or malicious constructs. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, reflecting its benign, metadata-only nature. The high confidence score (1) is justified due to the simplicity and clarity of the code, and no further concerns are warranted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign header containing licensing information and versioning, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
