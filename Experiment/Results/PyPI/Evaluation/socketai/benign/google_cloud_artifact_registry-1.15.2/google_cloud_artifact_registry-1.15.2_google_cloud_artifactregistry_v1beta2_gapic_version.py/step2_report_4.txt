  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Findings:** The code contains only comments, licensing notices, and a version assignment. No executable code, data handling, or data flows.\n   - **Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (default low risk for metadata files). The report assigns 0, which is consistent with the benign nature.\n   \n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Findings:** Similar to report 1—only static comments and a version variable. No code execution or data flow.\n   - **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The report assigns 0, which is appropriate.\n   \n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Findings:** Again, only comments and a version string. No executable code or data flow.\n   - **Assessment:** Valid. No malicious activity.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The report's scores are consistent.\n   \n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Findings:** Same pattern—license comments and version string only.\n   - **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n   \n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Findings:** Identical to others—metadata comments and version info only.\n   - **Assessment:** Valid. No malicious behavior.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code Presence:** All reports are accurate in stating that the code contains only comments and a version variable.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware or obfuscation are present in any snippet.\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the nature of these snippets, a risk score of 0 is appropriate. Assigning a score higher than 0.5 would imply a significant security concern, which is unwarranted here.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code snippets are purely metadata headers with no executable or dynamic code.\n- No data flows, input/output, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The scores assigned (0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk) are accurate and reasonable.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, metadata-only nature of the code snippets.",
