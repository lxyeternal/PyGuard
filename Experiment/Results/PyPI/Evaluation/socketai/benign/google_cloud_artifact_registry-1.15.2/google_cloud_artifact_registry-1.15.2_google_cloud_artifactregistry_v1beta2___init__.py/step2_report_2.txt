  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is an index module importing SDK components; no input/output or data processing.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows or untrusted data handling.  \n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious constructs.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** It's a benign SDK index file, standard for library setup. No malicious activity or security risks.  \n- **Confidence & Scores:** Confidence is high (1). Malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static imports, version setting, and no runtime data handling.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n- The conclusion is that it's a benign, standard module setup.  \n- Scores: All zeros, matching the benign nature, high confidence.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Again, a straightforward import/export module for SDK components.  \n- No data flow, no dynamic code, no secrets.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- Conclusion: benign, standard SDK module.  \n- Scores: all zeros, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Same pattern: import/export setup, no runtime data handling, no suspicious code.  \n- No anomalies or malicious patterns.  \n- Conclusion: a typical client library setup, safe.  \n- Scores: all zeros, matching the benign assessment.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Similar to others, standard SDK module setup with no data processing or suspicious constructs.  \n- No anomalies or malicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: safe, standard SDK setup.  \n- Scores: all zeros, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a static, benign SDK index module with no runtime data processing, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** No errors or logical flaws are evident. All reports are consistent and accurate in their benign assessment.\n- **Scores & Justification:**  \n  - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the static, non-executable nature of the code.  \n  - The obfuscated score is 0, as there's no obfuscation.  \n  - The overall security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct; no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct; no security issues)\n\n**Additional Notes:**  \n- The code is a typical auto-generated SDK module, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.  \n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis is based on static code review.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the static, benign nature of the code.",
