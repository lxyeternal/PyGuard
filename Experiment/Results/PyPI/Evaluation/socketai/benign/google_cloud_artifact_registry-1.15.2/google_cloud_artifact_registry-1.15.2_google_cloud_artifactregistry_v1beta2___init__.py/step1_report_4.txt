  "purpose": "This code module primarily imports and exports classes, functions, and constants related to Google Cloud Artifact Registry APIs, enabling interaction with various artifact types and repository operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from google.cloud.artifactregistry_v1beta2 and relative local module attributes",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or untrusted data processing detected; no data transmission or execution based on external input",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code consists solely of imports and definitions without runtime data handling",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. No suspicious behavior or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module setting up imports and __all__ exports for a client library. It only involves importing classes and functions related to Google Cloud's Artifact Registry API. There are no data processing, no user input handling, no network operations, and no dynamic code execution. The initial comments include licensing and copyright notices. No anomalies, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical client library setup with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It only imports and exposes API-related classes and functions. The overall security risk is negligible, with high confidence in this assessment.",
