{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an index module exporting SDK components and types for the Google Cloud Artifact Registry client library, facilitating import and usage in other modules.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from external SDK modules and local type definitions; no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no network, file, or command execution involved.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines imports and exports without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, static, and well-structured with licensing comments and versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module primarily consisting of import statements, licensing, and re-exports of classes and types. It does not perform any dynamic operations, data processing, or network communication. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The structure is typical for SDK index files, indicating a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static SDK index module with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk signals. It poses no threat or security concern.",
