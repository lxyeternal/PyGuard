{
  "purpose": "The code defines imports and exports for Artifact Registry client classes, facilitating access to synchronous and asynchronous clients.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.async_client and .client).",
  "sinks": "No evident sink that processes untrusted data or performs critical actions.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules; __all__ specifies exports. No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and an __all__ definition, which are standard for module exports. There are no functions, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations. The licensing comments indicate compliance but do not influence code security. No signs of malicious or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup for client exports, with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
