  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists of standard imports and exports with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes from local modules and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no input handling, data processing, or network operations. The licensing comments indicate open-source licensing terms, but no actual executable or malicious code is present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
