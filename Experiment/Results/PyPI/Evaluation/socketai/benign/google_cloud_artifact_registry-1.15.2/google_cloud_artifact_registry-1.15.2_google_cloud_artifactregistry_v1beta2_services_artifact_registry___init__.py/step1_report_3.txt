  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for ArtifactRegistryClient and ArtifactRegistryAsyncClient classes, serving as an interface for interacting with Google Artifact Registry.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules (.async_client and .client). No external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing, no untrusted data handling, or network activity present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from internal modules and declares them in __all__ for export. No input handling, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious network activity. The licensing comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard Python module initialization file for a client library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
