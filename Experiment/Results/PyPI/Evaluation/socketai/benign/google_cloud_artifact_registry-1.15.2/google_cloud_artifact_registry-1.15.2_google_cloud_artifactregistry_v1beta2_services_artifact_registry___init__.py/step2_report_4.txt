  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports systematically:\n\n**Code Review:**\n\nThe code is a minimal Python module that imports two classes (`ArtifactRegistryAsyncClient` and `ArtifactRegistryClient`) from local modules and declares `__all__` for exports. It includes standard licensing comments. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input.\n\n**Assessment of Security Risks:**\n\n- **Malicious Behavior:** No signs of malicious code, such as code injection, dynamic execution, or obfuscated logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward and well-structured; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** The code does not process user input, handle external data, or perform any operations that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n- **Supply Chain Risks:** The code is a typical package initializer, with no suspicious dependencies or behaviors.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0. The code does not exhibit any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0. The code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.5 or lower. Since the code is benign and standard, a risk score of 0 is appropriate. A score of 0.5 would suggest some minor concern, which is not justified here.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. They are consistent with the actual code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** This is a standard module setup for a client library, with no security concerns based on the provided code.",
