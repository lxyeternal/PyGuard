  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- Sources: Reads version info via regex from a local file, loads README.\n- Sinks: No external data or network activity.\n- Flows: Reads local files, passes static data to `setuptools.setup()`.\n- Anomalies: None detected; code is typical for packaging.\n- Analysis: No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard package setup.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (low, just standard setup)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, standard setup.\n- Sources: Reads version and README from local files.\n- Sinks: No network or external data manipulation.\n- Flows: Static data passing.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: No dynamic or suspicious code.\n- Conclusion: No security concerns.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (completely standard)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Standard packaging script.\n- Sources: Reads version, README, dependencies.\n- Sinks: No untrusted data or external connections.\n- Flows: Reads local files, static data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Follows best practices, no dynamic code or obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup for packaging.\n- Sources: Reads version, README, dependencies.\n- Sinks: No external or untrusted data.\n- Flows: Reads local files, static data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- Conclusion: No security issues.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Standard packaging.\n- Sources: Reads version info, README, finds packages.\n- Sinks: No external data or network activity.\n- Flows: Reads local files, static data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard, well-structured setup script.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- **Malware score:** All 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All 0 or very close to it; the only minor point is the reliance on regex for version extraction, which is safe here.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured Python package setup script.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The scores assigned in reports are appropriate.\n\n**My personal estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard setup process)\n\nThis thorough review confirms the package setup script is benign and follows best practices.",
