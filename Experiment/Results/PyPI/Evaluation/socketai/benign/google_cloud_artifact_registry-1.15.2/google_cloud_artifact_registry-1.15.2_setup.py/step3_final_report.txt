  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for configuring package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from a local Python file using regex, reads README file for long description, and discovers packages via setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No external data or network activity; static data passed to setuptools.setup().",
  "flows": "Reads local files (version, README), passes static data to setup function.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package. It reads version info safely from a local file, loads README content, discovers packages using standard setuptools methods, and invokes setup() with appropriate metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. The regex used for version extraction is straightforward and safe. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The script follows best practices for packaging and distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup routine with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
