  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the script is a standard setup script, reading version info from a file, reading README, and invoking `setuptools.setup()`. No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1\n- **Evaluation:** The minimal security risk score seems appropriate given the nature of the script. No issues are present in the logic or implementation.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the script handles package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0\n- **Evaluation:** The zero security risk score aligns with the analysis; no concerns here.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that the script is a standard setup process, with no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0\n- **Evaluation:** The assessment appears sound.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms the script's standard behavior, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0\n- **Evaluation:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—standard packaging script, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0\n- **Evaluation:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports agree that the code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws in logic:** None detected.\n- **Scores justification:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 across all reports is justified; no malicious activity is evident.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward and transparent.\n  - **Security Risk:** Very low (0 or 0.1), since the script only reads local files and invokes setup routines without external or untrusted data.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured Python package setup script.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### My recommended scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, just reflecting that it’s a build script with minimal risk)\n\n**Summary:** The package setup script is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
