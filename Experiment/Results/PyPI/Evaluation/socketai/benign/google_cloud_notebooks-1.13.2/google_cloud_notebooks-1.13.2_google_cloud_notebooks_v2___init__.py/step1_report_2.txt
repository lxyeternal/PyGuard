{
  "purpose": "This code defines module metadata, imports, and exposes classes and types for a Google Cloud Notebooks SDK client library, facilitating interaction with Google Cloud services.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.cloud.notebooks_v2, package_version, and internal service and type modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; code does not process external input or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; module primarily sets up class and type imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard SDK module setup for Google Cloud Notebooks, including licensing, imports, and explicit exports. It references external modules and types but does not process user input or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. The structure is typical for SDK libraries, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK module initialization script. It serves as a collection of imports and exports for a Google Cloud client library, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
