{
  "purpose": "This code is a Python module that imports various classes and functions related to Google Cloud Notebooks API, setting up the module's public interface.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'google.cloud.notebooks_v2' package and relative imports of specific classes and types within the module.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no sinks where untrusted data could cause security issues, such as network calls or data writes.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks is present, as this is a static import and class definition file.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected. All code appears to be standard library imports and module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of license comments, import statements, and an '__all__' declaration to specify the public API. No external inputs are processed, and no functions or methods are defined that could handle untrusted data. The imports are from official Google Cloud libraries, and the structure follows typical Python package initialization patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign Python module setup file with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It solely declares the public API for the package and imports necessary classes and functions.",
