{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an SDK module initialization for Google Cloud Notebooks, importing necessary classes, types, and version info, then defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Static import statements and version assignment; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is declarative and static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard licensing comments, imports, and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module setup for a Python SDK, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external input handling. It imports classes and types from trusted libraries, assigns a version, and defines __all__ for exports. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK module initialization with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
