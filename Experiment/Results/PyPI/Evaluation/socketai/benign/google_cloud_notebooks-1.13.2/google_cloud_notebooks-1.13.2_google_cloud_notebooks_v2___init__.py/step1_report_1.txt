{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports classes and types for Google Cloud Notebook service interactions, including clients and data models for managing notebook instances.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.cloud.notebooks_v2 and internal module attributes such as package_version.__version__",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; primarily class and type declarations and imports",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions or data sinks; static declaration of types and client classes only",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules, defines version information, and exports classes and types related to Google Cloud Notebook services. There are no functions, data processing, or runtime behaviors that could facilitate malicious activity. The license comments and import statements are standard and do not indicate any malicious intent. The structure is typical for a Python SDK or client library package.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard SDK module for Google Cloud Notebook services, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
