{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports classes and types related to Google Cloud Notebooks API client libraries for use in managing notebook instances and configurations.",
  "sources": "Import statements, including 'google.cloud.notebooks_v2.gapic_version' for version info and local modules for service clients and data types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present in the code.",
  "flows": "The code imports version info and class/type definitions without involving any data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code strictly consists of imports, version assignment, and explicit exports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of importing modules and defining the __all__ list for exports. It imports version info and various client and data type classes from a Google Cloud SDK package related to notebooks. There are no dynamic code executions, external input handling, or suspicious constructs. The licensing and comments are standard for open-source Google SDK files. Overall, the code appears to be a typical SDK module setup with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign SDK module file used for Google Cloud Notebooks client libraries. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no obfuscated code. It simply exposes certain classes and types for use by other modules.",
