{
  "purpose": "This code defines imports and exports for a Python package related to Google Cloud Notebooks, setting up module dependencies and exposing key classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.cloud.notebooks_v2 and local module files, including version information and various class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; the code primarily imports and re-exports modules and classes.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code strictly imports and defines module exports without dynamic code execution, credential handling, or external communications.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard module import statements, version referencing, and defining the __all__ list for public API exposure. No user inputs, network communications, or runtime code execution are observed. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns. The licensing comments are standard boilerplate. Overall, the structure aligns with typical SDK or library initialization code, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward package module setup for Google Cloud Notebooks SDK components. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code patterns, and no security risks. The code is benign and serves a standard purpose of defining package exports.",
