  "purpose": "This code provides licensing information and a version identifier, serving as metadata in an open source project.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ = \"1.13.2\")",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code contains only comments and a variable assignment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward comments and a version string with no dynamic or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version string assignment, with no executable logic, data processing, or dynamic code. All reports correctly identify this as benign metadata. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
