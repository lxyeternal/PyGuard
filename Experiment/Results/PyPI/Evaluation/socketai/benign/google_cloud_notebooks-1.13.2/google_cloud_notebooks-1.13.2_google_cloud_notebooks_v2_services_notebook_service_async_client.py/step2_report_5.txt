  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue:** \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.\n- **Assessment:** The report indicates no suspicious activity; an empty response can occur in normal API calls, especially if the request was invalid or no data exists.\n- **Code presence:** The code includes standard async API calls, request validation, and response handling. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** Both scores are 0, which aligns with the absence of suspicious code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is reasonable, given no evident security concern.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion that the code is safe is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as an async client for Google Cloud Notebooks, with standard data flow and no anomalies.\n- **Analysis:** The report confirms the code uses typical SDK patterns, with no signs of backdoors, malicious network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware/obfuscated scores:** Both 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 or 0.2 is appropriate; 0.2 is acceptable as a conservative measure.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assertion of safety is justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous, standard async client code.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies, no malicious patterns, standard SDK usage.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0, matching expectations.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is legitimate and safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Again, standard async client for Google Cloud Notebooks.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Both malware and obfuscated at 0.\n- **Risk:** 0, aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, standard SDK client code.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious network activity.\n- **Scores:** Both malware and obfuscated at 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 is slightly conservative but acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code segments identified.\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.0, 0.1, 0.2) are reasonable, given the nature of the code as an SDK client.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks beyond typical SDK operation.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, legitimate Google Cloud SDK client implementation for asynchronous management of notebooks. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious elements are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep all scores at zero for malware and obfuscated, with a risk score of 0, reflecting the code's safe and standard nature.",
