{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that exports classes for a Notebook Service client and its asynchronous counterpart, likely part of a larger SDK or API wrapper for interacting with a notebook service.",
  "sources": "Imports of NotebookServiceAsyncClient and NotebookServiceClient from local modules",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks where untrusted data is processed or could leak; no network or file operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports classes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious function calls, no unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and an explicit list of exported classes. It contains license and copyright comments. There are no user inputs, network communications, or data processing. The structure is straightforward and adheres to standard Python module practices. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module that exports client classes for a notebook service API. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and typical for SDK code.",
