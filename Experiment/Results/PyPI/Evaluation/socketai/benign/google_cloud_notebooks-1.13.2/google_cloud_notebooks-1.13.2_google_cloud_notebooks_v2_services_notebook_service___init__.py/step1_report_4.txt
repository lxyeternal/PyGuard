{
  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for a Python package, specifically exposing NotebookServiceClient and NotebookServiceAsyncClient classes.",
  "sources": "Imports of classes from local modules (.async_client and .client). No external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs; no data handling or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up exports for other modules.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code patterns, or suspicious constructs; straightforward module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code contains import statements and an __all__ tuple defining what symbols are exported from this module. It includes licensing comments but no executable logic, data handling, or network communication. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a simple interface definition for a larger package.",
