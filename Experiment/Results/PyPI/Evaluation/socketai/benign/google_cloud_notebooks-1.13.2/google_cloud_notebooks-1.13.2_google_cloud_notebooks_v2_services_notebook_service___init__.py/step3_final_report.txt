{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing and exposing the NotebookServiceClient and NotebookServiceAsyncClient classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.async_client and .client).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only imports and exports classes without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with licensing comments and import/export statements only.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports two classes and defines __all__ for exports. It contains only licensing comments, import statements, and an export list. There are no dynamic code, data processing, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The code functions as a standard package __init__.py or module setup file, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and safe, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
