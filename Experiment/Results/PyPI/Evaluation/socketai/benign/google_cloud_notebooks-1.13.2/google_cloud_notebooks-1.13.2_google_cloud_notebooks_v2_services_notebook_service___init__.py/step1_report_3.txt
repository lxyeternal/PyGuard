{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports client classes for interacting with a Notebook service API, likely for cloud or service management purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .async_client and .client",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; no network, file, or environment data manipulation",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply imports and exposes classes",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs; standard licensing comments, proper module structure, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code contains licensing and copyright information, imports specific classes from local modules, and defines __all__ for export. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The module appears to be a straightforward package initializer or interface file.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign Python module that exports client classes for a service API. No malicious intent, no suspicious activities detected.",
