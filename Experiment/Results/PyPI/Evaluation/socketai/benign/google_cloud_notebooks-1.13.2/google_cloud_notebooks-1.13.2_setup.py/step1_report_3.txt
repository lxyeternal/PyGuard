  "purpose": "Setup script for the google-cloud-notebooks Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and package configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading version from 'gapic_version.py', reading README file, importing system modules os, io, re, and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No unsafe data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reading version file -> setting version variable; reading README -> setting long_description; using setuptools.setup() with configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: extracting version info from a file, reading README content, defining dependencies, and invoking setuptools.setup(). All operations are typical for a Python package setup, with no signs of malicious activity. The code reads files securely, uses standard library functions, and does not include any obfuscated or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe, and the process follows standard practices for package distribution.",
