  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe a standard Python package setup script.\n- The code reads version info from a local file (`gapic_version.py`) via regex, which is a common practice.\n- The script reads the README file safely.\n- Dependencies are statically defined with explicit version constraints.\n- No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are very low (around 0.1), consistent with standard package setup scripts.\n\n**Specific issues or anomalies:**\n- No anomalies or suspicious code are identified across all reports.\n- The process appears to be standard and secure.\n- The version extraction method is straightforward and safe.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Malware scores: All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated scores: All are 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- Risk scores: Very low (0.1), reflecting minimal security concern for a setup script.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- The only minor point is the regex extraction of version info, which, while standard, could theoretically be exploited if the file content is maliciously altered. However, given that this is a local file read, and the file is part of the package source, this is not a security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical, well-structured setup script.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, typical for package setup scripts)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed reviews and the nature of the code.\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign scores independently, I would agree with the provided scores. The overall security posture of this package setup script is very safe.",
