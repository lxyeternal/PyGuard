  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Assessment**: Correctly identifies that the code is just a license header with no executable logic, data flows, or suspicious activity.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: Accurate.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Assessment**: Similar to Report 1, confirms the code is just a license header with no malicious behavior.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: Accurate.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Assessment**: Same as above, license header with no executable code or anomalies.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: Accurate.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Assessment**: Consistent with previous reports, standard license comment block.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: Accurate.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Assessment**: Same as others, purely licensing comments.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: Accurate.\n\n**Overall Analysis**:\n- All reports correctly identify that the provided code snippet is just a license header with no executable logic, data input/output, or suspicious elements.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the content.\n- No anomalies, assumptions, or claims about vulnerabilities are present; the reasoning is sound.\n\n**Final Justification**:\n- Given the code is only comments with licensing info, there is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary**:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code snippet is benign, and the scoring reflects that appropriately.",
