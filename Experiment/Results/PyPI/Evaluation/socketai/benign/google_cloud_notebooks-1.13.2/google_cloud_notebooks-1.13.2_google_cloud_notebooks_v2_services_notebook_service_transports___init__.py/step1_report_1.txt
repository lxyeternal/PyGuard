{
  "purpose": "The code defines and registers different transport classes for a Notebook Service API, facilitating different communication protocols.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and classes, and assigns transport classes to a registry.",
  "targets": "No specific sinks are present in this code; it primarily sets up class references.",
  "flows": "Imports and class registration flow; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated or malicious-looking constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and classes, then creates a registry dictionary mapping protocol names to transport classes. No user input handling, network operations, or dynamic execution present. The license and comments are standard. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are observed. The code appears to be a typical module setup for a Python package, with no malicious intent or malicious code embedded.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module establishing a registry of transport classes for a service API. No malicious behavior, no security risks identified, and no anomalies found.",
