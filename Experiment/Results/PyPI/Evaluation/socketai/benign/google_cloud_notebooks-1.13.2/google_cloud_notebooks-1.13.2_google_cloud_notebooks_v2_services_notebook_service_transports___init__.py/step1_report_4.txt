{
  "purpose": "This code defines a registry of transport classes for a NotebookService, allowing selection of different transport mechanisms (gRPC, gRPC AsyncIO, REST). It exports these classes for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Imports from the same package modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest), and the creation of a registry dictionary mapping strings to transport class types.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; the code is primarily class registration and export.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks; no untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific transport classes, creates an ordered registry of these transports, and defines exports for external use. It does not process or handle user input, external data, or perform any operations that could lead to security issues. The code appears to be standard module setup code with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module for registering and exporting transport classes. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
