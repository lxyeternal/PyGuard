  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation**:  \n   The code is a straightforward Python module that imports transport classes, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and exposes them via `__all__`. It contains no user input, network calls, dynamic execution, or any data processing beyond class registration. The code is standard for setting up a client SDK's transport layer.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n   No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears benign, with standard licensing, imports, and class registration. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are observed.\n\n3. **Analysis of Scores**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The obfuscated score is also 0, consistent with the code's clarity. The security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely for class registration and has no malicious or suspicious elements, there is no justification for higher risk scores. The current scores of 0 or 1 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is standard and does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. No claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions are present.\n\n6. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's content. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis is a benign, standard module for registering transport classes in a client SDK. No security concerns, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n**My estimated scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThese align with the detailed analysis and the consensus across all reports.",
