{
  "purpose": "The code sets up and exports a registry of transport classes for a Notebook service, facilitating different communication protocols (gRPC, REST, etc.)",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes from the same package and from standard libraries",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input; no data leaks or external network actions",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily defines and exports class references",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific classes and modules, then compiles a registry dictionary mapping string keys to transport classes. It then defines __all__ for public API exports. There are no indications of input handling, data processing, or network actions that could be exploited. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration/setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module for registering and exporting transport classes for a service client. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
