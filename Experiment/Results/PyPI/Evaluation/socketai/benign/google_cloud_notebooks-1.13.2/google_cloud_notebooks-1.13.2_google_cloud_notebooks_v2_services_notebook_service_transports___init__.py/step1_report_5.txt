{
  "purpose": "Define and register different transport mechanisms for a NotebookService API, including gRPC, asyncio, and REST transports.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, local modules, and module-level variable initialization.",
  "sinks": "No sink points; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "Imports and module-level variable initialization, setting up transport registry.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code mainly registers classes for transport mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary classes, creates an ordered dictionary to register transport types, and populates this registry with class references. The code is straightforward, with no user input handling, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious constructs identified. It appears to be a standard module setup for a client library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup module for transport registration in a client SDK. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected.",
