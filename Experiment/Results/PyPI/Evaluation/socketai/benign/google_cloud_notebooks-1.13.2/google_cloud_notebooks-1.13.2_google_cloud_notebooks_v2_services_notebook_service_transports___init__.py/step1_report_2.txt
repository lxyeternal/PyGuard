{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a registry of transport classes for a NotebookService, likely used for different communication protocols (gRPC, REST).",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest). No external or untrusted input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; the code primarily sets up class references and a registry.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only defines data structures and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code is standard and clean, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary classes and sets up an ordered registry of transport classes for different protocols. It then exports these classes via __all__ for external use. No external input, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic is present. The license header is standard and indicates open-source licensing. Overall, this is a typical setup module for a Python package, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setting up transport class registry for a service client. There are no malicious behaviors, no suspicious code, and it follows standard coding practices. It is safe for use and contains no security risks.",
