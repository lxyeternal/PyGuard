{
  "purpose": "This code registers transport classes for a Notebook Service API in a Python SDK, mapping protocol identifiers to their respective classes and exposing them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements for transport classes and the creation of an ordered dictionary _transport_registry.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or dynamic execution present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "The code maps class types to protocol strings in _transport_registry without any data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup module for registering transport classes, with no input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It imports classes, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and exposes them via __all__. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code. The code's simplicity and clarity support a high confidence in its benign intent. No vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are evident, and the code aligns with typical SDK setup modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
