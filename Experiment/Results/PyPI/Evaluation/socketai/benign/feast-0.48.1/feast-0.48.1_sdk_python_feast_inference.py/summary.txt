  "conclusion": "The code is a benign schema inference utility used in data pipelines and feature store management. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects its limited scope and safe operation."
