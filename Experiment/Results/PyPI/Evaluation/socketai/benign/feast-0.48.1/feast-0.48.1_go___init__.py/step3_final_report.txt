  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or system interaction with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from internal variables or external systems (if any), but no explicit input sources are shown.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks are evident in the provided snippets.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (if any) to processing functions, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious transfers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or incomplete, with no network, file, or system calls indicating malicious activity. Multiple reports confirm benign intent with high confidence (0.9). The security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern. No obfuscation or malware is detected. The assessments are consistent and justified given the limited context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate. The overall evaluation indicates a safe dependency with minimal threat.",
