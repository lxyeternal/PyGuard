  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script that performs some form of data processing or system interaction, but without specific context, the precise purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data could originate from environment variables, function arguments, or external files/read operations (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or subprocess executions (not explicitly shown), which could be used maliciously.",
  "flows": "Data likely flows from input sources to output or system commands; however, explicit source and sink points are not detailed in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns. The code does not use obfuscation techniques. No suspicious dynamic execution or obscure language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, without signs of obfuscated logic or malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are visible. Given the limited code, it is not possible to definitively identify malicious activities or vulnerabilities. The code’s structure and behavior do not indicate any malicious purpose or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but the limited snippet restricts a comprehensive assessment.",
