  "purpose": "Define feature sources, entities, and transformations for a feature store using Feast, including local file source and on-demand feature calculation.",
  "sources": "FileSource reading from 'driver_stats.parquet', RequestSource for 'vals_to_add' input data.",
  "sinks": "Logging configuration for FeatureService, but no external or untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input data from parquet file and request source flow into feature view and on-demand feature transformation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden backdoors observed. Use of standard Feast components and pandas is typical. No obfuscated code or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data sources, entities, feature views, and feature transformations using the Feast SDK. The 'FileSource' loads local parquet data; 'RequestSource' captures request-time features; the on-demand feature view combines static and dynamic data. No suspicious data handling, external network activity, or security-critical operations are present. The code follows standard patterns for feature engineering and does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of feature definitions and transformations for a Feast feature store. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are identified. The overall security risk is low.",
