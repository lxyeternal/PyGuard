{
  "purpose": "This code provides a decorator to handle HTTP errors for a session object used in the Feast framework, enhancing HTTP method calls with logging and error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads data from get_http_auth_requests_session (configuration), and from response objects (response.json()) within wrapped methods.",
  "sinks": "Response data (response.json()) potentially leaks detailed error information; also, any exceptions raised from FeastError could affect calling functions.",
  "flows": "Session methods (get, post, put, delete) invoke network requests; responses are processed, errors mapped and potentially raised, with logging involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. The code dynamically wraps session methods; no obfuscated code or hidden backdoors observed. Usage of assertions for type checks, which is not necessarily malicious but could be avoided for production.",
  "analysis": "The code decorates a session object with wrapped HTTP methods to add logging and error handling. It extracts error details from responses and raises mapped FeastError instances. No suspicious data leaks or malicious behavior are evident. The code's main focus is on error handling, not on data exfiltration or malicious actions. The dynamic method wrapping is standard for enhancing behavior. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent. The use of assertions for type checks is a minor concern but not malicious. Overall, the code appears legitimate and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard decorator for handling HTTP errors with logging in a Python client, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely enhances session methods for error handling, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
