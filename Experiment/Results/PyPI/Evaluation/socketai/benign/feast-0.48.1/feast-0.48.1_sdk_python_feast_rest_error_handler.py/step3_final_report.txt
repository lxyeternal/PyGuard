  "purpose": "A decorator that wraps HTTP session methods (get, post, put, delete) to add logging, error handling, and response validation, facilitating robust API interactions.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'config.auth_config' for authentication configuration; calls session methods (get, post, put, delete); accesses response.json() during error handling.",
  "sinks": "Response objects that may leak data if responses are maliciously crafted; logs request and response details; raises FeastError based on response JSON.",
  "flows": "Obtains session via get_http_auth_requests_session -> calls session methods -> on error, response.json() is parsed -> errors are mapped and raised -> response object returned to caller.",
  "anomalies": "Uses response.json() directly in error handling without validation, which could be risky if responses are malicious; dynamically reassigns session methods, which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard pattern for wrapping HTTP request methods with logging and error handling. It retrieves a session with get_http_auth_requests_session, then replaces session methods with wrapped versions that log calls, check for HTTP errors via raise_for_status(), and parse error details from response.json() to raise FeastError. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The use of response.json() in error handling could be exploited if responses are maliciously crafted, but this is a common practice in error processing routines. The dynamic method reassignment is unconventional but not harmful. Overall, the code is benign, with minimal security risk primarily associated with unvalidated JSON parsing. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the slight potential for issues if responses are maliciously crafted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign HTTP request wrapper with comprehensive logging and error handling. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is evident. The minor security concern relates to parsing untrusted JSON responses in error handling, which is typical but should be handled carefully in sensitive environments. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
