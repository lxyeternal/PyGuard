All obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. No evidence of obfuscation or confirmed malware in other reports. The overall assessment indicates moderate suspicion primarily due to Report 5's patterns."

The use of `context.abort()` with exception details could leak internal info if not sanitized, but this is typical in error reporting. All signals indicate benign, standard behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign HTTP request wrapper with comprehensive logging and error handling. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is evident. The minor security concern relates to parsing untrusted JSON responses in error handling, which is typical but should be handled carefully in sensitive environments. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
