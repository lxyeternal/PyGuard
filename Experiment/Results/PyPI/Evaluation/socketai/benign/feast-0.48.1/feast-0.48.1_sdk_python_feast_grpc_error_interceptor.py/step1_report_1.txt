{
  "purpose": "The code provides a gRPC server interceptor to handle exceptions and ensure proper error reporting.",
  "sources": "Input data from gRPC requests and exceptions raised during request handling.",
  "sinks": "Calls to context.abort() that terminate the RPC with an error status and details.",
  "flows": "Input request data flows into handler functions, exceptions caught in exception_wrapper are used to call context.abort(), terminating the request with error info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual control flow. Use of lambda functions is standard for wrapping handlers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception wrapper for gRPC and FeastError exceptions, then creates an ErrorInterceptor class implementing gRPC server interception. It wraps various handler types with lambda functions that invoke exception_wrapper, which catches exceptions and aborts the request with appropriate error codes and details. The code's structure is consistent with standard gRPC middleware patterns and does not contain obfuscated or malicious patterns. No suspicious data handling or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard gRPC server exception handling mechanism. It properly manages errors without evident malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. No security risks or malware behaviors are detected.",
