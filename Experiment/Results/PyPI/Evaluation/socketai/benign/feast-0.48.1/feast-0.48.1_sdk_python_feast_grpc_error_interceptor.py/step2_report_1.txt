  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a gRPC server interceptor for exception handling, sourcing from gRPC requests and exceptions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that context.abort() terminates RPCs with error info.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation. The code is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, with high confidence (1). Malware score is 0, which aligns with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, justified, as no security risk or malware.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's function.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes that context.abort() terminates RPCs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity or external calls, standard pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly less confident (0.9), but still appropriate.\n- **Malware & Risk:** Malware is 0, and risk is 0.2, which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the wrapping of handlers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes error propagation via context.abort().\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly higher confidence (0.95), which is justified given the straightforward code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code's function.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Notes that context.abort() terminates RPCs, which could leak internal error info if not sanitized, but this is standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard gRPC error handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), justified.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2, consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the interceptor wrapping.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes error propagation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behaviors or obfuscation. The use of context.abort() is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.95), appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0, consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is accurate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports are 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0 (0.2) in all reports, justified by the fact that error details are sent directly via context.abort(), which could leak internal info if not sanitized, but this is standard practice.\n\n### Final personal estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard error handling, minimal risk, but potential info leakage if error details are sensitive)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and their scores are appropriate. No adjustments necessary.",
