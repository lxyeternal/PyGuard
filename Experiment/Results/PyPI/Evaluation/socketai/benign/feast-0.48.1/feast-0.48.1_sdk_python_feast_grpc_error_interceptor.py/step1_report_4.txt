{
  "purpose": "The code implements a gRPC server interceptor to handle exceptions and errors during RPC calls, wrapping handlers to ensure proper error responses.",
  "sources": "Reads gRPC request data via handler functions and context, handles exceptions such as grpc.RpcError and FeastError.",
  "sinks": "Calls context.abort() to terminate RPC with error code and details, potentially exposing internal error information.",
  "flows": "Input request data flows through handler functions; exceptions caught and lead to context.abort() with error details, terminating the request.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code; standard gRPC exception handling pattern. No unusual or obfuscated code. Usage of lambda functions is typical in such handlers.",
  "analysis": "The code wraps gRPC handlers to catch specific exceptions (grpc.RpcError and FeastError) and aborts the RPC with appropriate error codes and details. It differentiates between unary and streaming RPCs, returning appropriate handlers. No untrusted data injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code handles exceptions cleanly and does not include any malicious logic or obfuscation. The context.abort() calls might leak internal error details if not sanitized but are standard practice for error reporting.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard gRPC error handling interceptor without malicious intent. It properly manages exceptions and does not exhibit signs of malware or security risks. No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.",
