  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements a gRPC server interceptor (`ErrorInterceptor`) that wraps all four types of RPC handlers.\n- Uses `exception_wrapper` to catch `grpc.RpcError` and `FeastError`, then calls `context.abort()` with the corresponding error code and details.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The code structure is standard for gRPC middleware and error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in the code:\n- The code appears correct and consistent with typical gRPC server interceptors.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The exception handling logic is straightforward and standard.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; describes the code as a standard gRPC error handler.\n- **Security & malware:** Correctly notes no malicious intent, malware, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - Security risk: 0 (appropriate, since no vulnerabilities are evident)\n- **Confidence:** 1 (full confidence)\n- **Verdict:** Sound and consistent.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct; recognizes standard pattern, no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - Security risk: 0.2 — perhaps slightly high but acceptable given the `context.abort()` calls could expose internal errors if not sanitized. However, since the code just propagates errors, this is reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (high confidence)\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct; describes the code as a typical gRPC error handler.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - Security risk: 0.2 — again, acceptable given the context.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 (very high)\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct; recognizes standard exception handling, no malicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - Security risk: 0.2 — consistent with the use of `context.abort()`.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct; describes the code as a legitimate interceptor.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0 (since no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency:\n- All reports agree the code is standard, benign, and free of malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is justified.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (minor potential concern about error details exposure, but standard practice)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard error handling, minor info leak risk if error details are not sanitized, but common in such implementations)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe and standard for gRPC error handling. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \n- The scores are reasonable.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n- The code is a typical, well-implemented gRPC error handling interceptor.\n\n**End of review.**",
