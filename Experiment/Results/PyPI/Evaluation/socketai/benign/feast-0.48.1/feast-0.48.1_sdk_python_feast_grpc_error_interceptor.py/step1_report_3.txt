{
  "purpose": "The code implements a gRPC server interceptor that wraps request handlers with exception handling logic, converting exceptions into gRPC error responses.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from gRPC requests via handler methods; exceptions are caught during request processing.",
  "sinks": "Exception details and status codes are sent back to clients through gRPC context abort calls.",
  "flows": "Input data (requests) pass through handler functions; exceptions are caught and translated into gRPC error responses, which are sent to clients.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external communications are present. The code uses standard gRPC mechanisms for error handling without obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured exception handling mechanism for gRPC server methods, wrapping existing handlers with try-except blocks. It captures specific exceptions (grpc.RpcError and FeastError), converts them into gRPC error responses, and returns appropriately wrapped handlers for unary and streaming RPC types. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling detected. The use of exception wrapping is standard practice in gRPC server implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of a gRPC server interceptor for exception handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and aligns with typical server-side error handling patterns.",
