{
  "purpose": "Implements a gRPC server interceptor that wraps request handlers with exception handling to catch specific errors and aborts the RPC with appropriate error codes and details.",
  "sources": "Reads from gRPC request handlers, exceptions `grpc.RpcError` and `FeastError`.",
  "sinks": "Calls `context.abort()` to terminate RPCs with error code and details, potentially exposing internal error info if not sanitized.",
  "flows": "Exception handling in `exception_wrapper` captures errors from handlers and propagates via `context.abort()`.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. Standard pattern for gRPC middleware.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward gRPC error handling interceptor wrapping all four handler types with lambda functions that invoke `exception_wrapper`. It catches specific exceptions and aborts the RPC with error info. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws. The potential for error detail leakage exists but is a common practice and not malicious. The code is clear, standard, and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard gRPC server interceptor for exception handling, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The use of `context.abort()` with exception details could leak internal info if not sanitized, but this is typical in error reporting. All signals indicate benign, standard behavior.",
