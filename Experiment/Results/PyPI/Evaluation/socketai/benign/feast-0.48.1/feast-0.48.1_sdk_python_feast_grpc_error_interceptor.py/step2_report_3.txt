  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a standard gRPC server interceptor wrapping handlers with exception handling.\n- It catches grpc.RpcError and FeastError, then calls context.abort() with the corresponding error code and details.\n- The implementation covers all four gRPC handler types.\n- No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are evident.\n- The code does not perform network calls, file writes, or data exfiltration.\n- The use of lambda functions for wrapping handlers is typical.\n- The error details passed to context.abort() could potentially leak internal info if not sanitized, but this is standard practice and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Accurate.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Correct.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Correctly identifies the code as a standard gRPC error handling pattern, with no malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Appropriate.\n- Scores: confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Accurate.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Correct.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Recognizes the code as standard, with no suspicious behaviors.\n- Conclusion: Correct.\n- Scores: confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate, though the securityRisk=0.2 might be slightly high given the potential for error details leakage, but overall acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Accurate.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Correct.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Properly notes the code as a standard pattern, with no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Appropriate.\n- Scores: confidence=0.95, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Accurate.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Correct.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Recognizes the potential for error details to leak via context.abort(), but notes this is standard.\n- Conclusion: Appropriate.\n- Scores: confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Accurate.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Correct.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Same as above, standard pattern, no malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Appropriate.\n- Scores: confidence=0.95, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** The risk scores are mostly 0.2, which might be slightly conservative, considering the potential leakage of error details via `context.abort()`. However, since this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious, this is acceptable.\n\n### **My final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to potential error detail leakage, but not a severe security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code. They correctly identify that this is a standard gRPC exception handling pattern with no malicious or obfuscated code. The risk score could be marginally increased if considering error detail leakage, but overall, 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed to the scores. The code appears safe, well-understood, and standard for gRPC error handling.",
