{
  "purpose": "This code defines a gRPC server interceptor that wraps method handlers with exception handling logic to manage errors gracefully.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from gRPC request objects and the context parameter, which is part of the gRPC framework's runtime data.",
  "sinks": "The code calls context.abort() to terminate RPCs with specific error codes and details; these are potential points where untrusted data could influence error reporting.",
  "flows": "Exceptions caught in exception_wrapper are routed to context.abort(), which terminates the RPC with error info. The interceptor wraps all four types of gRPC handlers, forwarding exceptions appropriately.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code uses standard gRPC exception handling and interceptors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a gRPC server interceptor that wraps handler calls to catch specific exceptions (grpc.RpcError and FeastError). When such exceptions occur, it calls context.abort() with the relevant error code and details, ensuring proper error propagation. The implementation covers all four common gRPC handler types (unary-unary, unary-stream, stream-unary, stream-stream). There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The use of exception handling and context.abort() is standard for gRPC services to handle errors gracefully. The code does not perform any data leaks, network connections, or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate gRPC server interceptor for exception handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely manages errors and propagates them appropriately. No malicious or maliciously disguised code is detected.",
