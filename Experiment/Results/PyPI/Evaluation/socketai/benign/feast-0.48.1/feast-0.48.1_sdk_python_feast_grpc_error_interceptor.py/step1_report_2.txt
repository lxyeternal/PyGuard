{
  "purpose": "This code defines a gRPC server interceptor for handling exceptions and errors during RPC calls.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the gRPC request and context objects, and from imported modules 'grpc' and 'feast.errors'.",
  "sinks": "Calls to context.abort(), which terminates the RPC with an error status, and the invocation of behavior functions (handlers).",
  "flows": "Input data (requests) are passed to handler functions wrapped by exception_wrapper; errors caught lead to calling context.abort().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. No network calls, file access, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard gRPC error handling pattern by wrapping RPC handlers with exception handling that calls context.abort() on exceptions. It imports 'grpc' and 'FeastError' but does not perform any network operations, file writes, or data leaks. The structure appears typical for a server-side interceptor, with no obfuscated or malicious code features. There are no suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a gRPC server error handling interceptor with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily handles exceptions and terminates RPCs with appropriate error codes.",
