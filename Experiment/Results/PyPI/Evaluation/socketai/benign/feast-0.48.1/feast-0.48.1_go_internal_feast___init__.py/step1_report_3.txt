  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with no explicit purpose stated. It may be part of a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Input sources include reading environment variables and potentially user input via function parameters or input() calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or subprocess executions, if present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (network, filesystem, subprocess), possibly via intermediate processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code constructs observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. No backdoors or malicious API calls identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is analyzed for typical malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system modifications. It reads input and environment data, processes it normally, and does not exhibit any suspicious behavior such as network connections to suspicious domains, encrypted payloads, or code obfuscation. Usage of third-party libraries is typical and not suspicious by itself. No clear malicious intent or malicious payloads are evident. The structure appears standard, with no unusual control flow or obfuscation techniques. The absence of hardcoded secrets and malicious API usage suggests a low likelihood of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the code provided, there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The code appears benign, with no indicators of malware, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
