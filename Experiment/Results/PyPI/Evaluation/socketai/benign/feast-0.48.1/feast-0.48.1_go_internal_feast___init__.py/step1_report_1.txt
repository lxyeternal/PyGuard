  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific functionality within a Python package, possibly related to data processing or system interaction.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from function parameters, environment variables, or external files; however, the specific sources are not explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, or data writes to files or output streams, but no direct suspicious sinks are clearly identifiable without further context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (e.g., parameters or environment variables) to processing functions, and then possibly to outputs or external systems; no clear malicious flow is observed from the given code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are apparent. The code uses standard Python features and libraries without unusual constructs. No suspicious behavior such as network connections or data exfiltration is evident.",
  "analysis": "A detailed step-by-step review shows the code follows conventional Python patterns. It imports standard modules, defines functions, and executes logic without any signs of malicious intent or hidden backdoors. There are no suspicious code injection points, unsafe eval calls, or unusual data handling. The code does not contain obfuscated constructs or malicious payloads. Overall, the code appears benign based on the visible content.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate component of a Python package with no signs of sabotage or malware. Confidence is high that this is safe, with no obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
