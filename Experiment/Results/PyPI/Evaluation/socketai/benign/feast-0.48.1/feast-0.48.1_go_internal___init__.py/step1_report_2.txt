  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or subprocess executions, but none are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Without specific code, flow analysis cannot be performed; normally involves tracing data from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are evident due to missing code content.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient code provided to analyze sources, sinks, or flows. The provided input is empty, preventing detailed examination. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues can be identified without actual code.",
