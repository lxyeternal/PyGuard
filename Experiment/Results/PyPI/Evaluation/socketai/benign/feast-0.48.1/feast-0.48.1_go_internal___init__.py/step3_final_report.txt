  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided descriptions.",
  "sources": "No code provided; analysis based on descriptions of data handling, environment variables, or imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential data output points such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable access, but none indicated as malicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (user/env/imports) to sinks (network, files), with no suspicious patterns reported.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; reports explicitly state absence of suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly note the absence of code or describe benign code with no signs of malicious payloads or obfuscation. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 or lower) are consistent with descriptions. Confidence levels are high (0.8) given the lack of concrete code. No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are indicated, and the reasoning aligns with the provided summaries.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are accurate and consistent; no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code exists. The low security risk scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
