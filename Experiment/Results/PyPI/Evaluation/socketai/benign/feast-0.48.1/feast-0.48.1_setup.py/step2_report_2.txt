  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for a Python package, defining dependencies, metadata, and package configuration.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted user input.\n- Dependency lists are extensive but typical for a large SDK.\n- The script reads static files (README.md), checks for 'git' presence, and configures versioning accordingly.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No issues, benign setup script.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Fully consistent. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard setup script, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion, standard setup code, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (noted as very low)\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Observation:** The only slight deviation is the \"securityRisk\" score of 0.1, which is negligible and likely reflects the standard risk associated with package setup scripts (which are inherently low risk).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Estimation**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code or behavior. I agree with a score of **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected in any report; I agree with **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code, the minimal \"securityRisk\" of 0.1 in report 5 is reasonable. The overall risk is very low, so I would assign a **risk score of 0** for the entire code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification**\n- The code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package.\n- No dynamic or malicious code is present.\n- Dependency lists are standard for an SDK.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or network activity.\n- The only minor concern is the inherent risk in package setup scripts, but it's negligible here.\n\n**Therefore, my overall assessment is:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Score |\n|----------------|--------------|\n| Malware        | 0            |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            |\n| Risk           | 0            |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of all reports.",
