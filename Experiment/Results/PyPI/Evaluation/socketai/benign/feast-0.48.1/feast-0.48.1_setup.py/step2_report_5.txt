  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: presence of malicious code, obfuscation, reasoning, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup.py for a Python package, with no suspicious or malicious code detected.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code only reads files, defines dependencies, and configures setup(), with no dynamic or network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate.**\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard setup script, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No dynamic code, network, or obfuscation. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate.**\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard setup code, static data, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No dynamic code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate.**\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard package setup, no suspicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No dynamic code or network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate.**\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar setup script, with a note that no untrusted input is processed; static data used.\n- **Assessment:** The only notable point is a \"securityRisk\" score of 0.1, which is very low and likely reflects minimal concern due to the use of `shutil.which(\"git\")` to determine versioning. This is standard practice.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — **reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is a straightforward setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- **Malicious code:** None detected; no network activity, code injection, obfuscation, or dynamic execution.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** Based on the code, no vulnerabilities are evident. The only minor concern is the use of `shutil.which(\"git\")`—a common pattern, not malicious.\n- **Scores consistency:** All scores align with the analysis; no false positives or negatives.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** to **0.1** — minimal, mostly due to standard versioning practices.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The provided reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard setup script with no signs of supply chain risk or malware. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**My overall assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for versioning check, but still very low)\n\nThis code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.",
