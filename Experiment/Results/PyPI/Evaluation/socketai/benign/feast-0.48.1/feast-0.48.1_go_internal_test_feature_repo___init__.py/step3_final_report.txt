  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic execution functions (`eval`, `exec`), hardcoded strings, suspicious imports, environment variables, input/output data flows.",
  "sinks": "Potential network connections, data leaks, environment variable access, file modifications, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables flow into dynamic execution or data processing functions, potentially leading to malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscation techniques, dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials/URLs, suspicious imports, unusual variable naming, inconsistent code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts. No explicit malicious payloads are confirmed, but the presence of suspicious patterns warrants caution. The scores assigned in the reports (obfuscation ~0.7, malware suspicion ~0.3, risk ~0.55-0.65) are consistent with the described features. Benign reports lack such indicators and are scored accordingly. Overall, the scoring aligns with the evidence, with reports 1 and 5 showing moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic features, while others are benign or inconclusive.",
  "conclusion": "The current scores are appropriate and justified based on the provided summaries. Reports 1 and 5 warrant cautious review before deployment due to obfuscation and dynamic execution. The other reports appear benign. No adjustments are necessary at this stage.",
