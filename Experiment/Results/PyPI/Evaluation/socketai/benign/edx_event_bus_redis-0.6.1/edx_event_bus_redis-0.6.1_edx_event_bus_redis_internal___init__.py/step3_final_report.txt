  "flows": "No data or control flow; only static comments present.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is purely descriptive comments with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments explaining internal implementation details and API organization. There are no executable statements, data handling, network interactions, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign documentation with no security implications. The scores are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
