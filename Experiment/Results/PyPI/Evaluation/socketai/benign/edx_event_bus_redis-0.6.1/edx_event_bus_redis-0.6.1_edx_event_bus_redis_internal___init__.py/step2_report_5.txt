  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, step-by-step, to determine if they are accurate and consistent with the provided code snippet.\n\n1. **Assessment of the Code Content:**\n   - The code is purely a comment block describing internal implementation details and the public API organization.\n   - There is no executable code, data handling, or external interactions.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, data flows, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues or Malicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that this is a documentation comment with no operational code.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious activity, or security risks are detectable in this snippet.\n   - Malware score is rightly zero across all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n3. **Logic, Reasoning, and Summary Accuracy:**\n   - Each report accurately states that the code is purely descriptive and non-executable.\n   - The conclusions are consistent and justified given the content.\n\n4. **Scores and Their Justification:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The security risk score is 0, correctly reflecting the absence of security issues.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, since there's no obfuscation or suspicious code.\n\n5. **Potential for Changes or Reconsideration:**\n   - Since the code is only comments, no changes to scores are necessary.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the content.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately scored.\n- No adjustments are needed.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code snippet is purely documentation, with no executable or security-sensitive content. All reports correctly reflect this, and the scoring aligns with the content.",
