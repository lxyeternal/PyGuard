  "purpose": "Define URL patterns for the edx_event_bus_redis module in a Django application.",
  "sources": "Import statements for re_path and TemplateView; the urlpatterns list.",
  "sinks": "The urlpatterns list, which could potentially define URL routes and views.",
  "flows": "Imports are used to define URL patterns, but no actual URL patterns are active or process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out URL pattern with no active routes; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present. The code contains unused imports but no malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django URL and view modules but does not define any active URL patterns. The only pattern is commented out, suggesting incomplete configuration or placeholder code. There are no sources of untrusted input, nor any sinks processing external data. The code appears to be boilerplate or a template with no active or malicious behavior. No anomalies like obfuscation or hidden code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, inactive URL configuration template with no malicious intent or security risks. It shows no evidence of malware or malicious behavior.",
