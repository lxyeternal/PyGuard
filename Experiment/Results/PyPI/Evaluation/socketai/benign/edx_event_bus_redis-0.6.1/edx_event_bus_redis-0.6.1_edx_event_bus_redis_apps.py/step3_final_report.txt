{
  "purpose": "This code defines a minimal Django application configuration class, setting only the application name without any dynamic behavior or external interactions.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input, data, or external sources; it solely defines a class with a static attribute.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple subclass of Django's AppConfig, setting only the 'name' attribute. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code's purpose is purely declarative.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django application configuration class with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the current scores accurately reflect its safe nature.",
