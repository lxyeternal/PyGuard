  "flows": "None; the code does not process any data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django application configuration class. It imports the necessary AppConfig base class and defines a class for app settings. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. The code contains only minimal configuration with no dynamic code execution, no input processing, and no external connections or secrets embedded. It is a standard boilerplate setup typical for Django apps.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple and benign Django app configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
