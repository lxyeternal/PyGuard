  "flows": "No data flows or input-to-output paths are present; static class definition only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard Django AppConfig subclass with minimal content.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Django AppConfig base class, defines a subclass for the 'edx_event_bus_redis' app, and sets its name. There are no input sources, external data handling, or data processing. No dynamic execution, user inputs, or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears to be boilerplate configuration for a Django app with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Django application configuration class with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
