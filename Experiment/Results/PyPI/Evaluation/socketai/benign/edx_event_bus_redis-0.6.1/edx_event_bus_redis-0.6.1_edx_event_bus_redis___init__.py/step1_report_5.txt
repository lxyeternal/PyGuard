  "purpose": "Implementing Redis Streams for the Open edX event bus by importing internal consumer and producer modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules 'edx_event_bus_redis.internal.consumer' and 'edx_event_bus_redis.internal.producer'. No other input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from sources to sinks as the code only contains imports and version declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports internal modules, which may indicate incomplete encapsulation or potential for hidden malicious behavior if those modules are malicious, but not evident from this snippet alone. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module for Redis Streams implementation, importing consumer and producer components from internal packages. It sets a version string. There is no data input, output, or processing logic shown. The use of internal modules could be a concern if those modules are malicious, but cannot be determined from this snippet. Overall, the code is minimal and does not show signs of malicious behavior or security risks directly.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet, there is no evident malicious behavior or security risk. The code primarily imports internal components necessary for Redis Streams implementation, with no suspicious activity or data leakage present.",
