  "purpose": "Implementing Redis Streams for the Open edX event bus to facilitate event publishing and consumption.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: edx_event_bus_redis.internal.consumer and edx_event_bus_redis.internal.producer",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports (sources) from internal modules, which likely handle data flow internally; no direct data flow to untrusted sinks shown.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; only standard import statements and version declaration are present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two components related to Redis event handling. The purpose appears to be to set up event publishing and consumption for the Open edX platform. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The version declaration is typical for package management. The code is straightforward and standard for initializing such functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears to be a standard module setup for Redis-based event handling without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is likely safe, given its simplicity and lack of suspicious constructs.",
