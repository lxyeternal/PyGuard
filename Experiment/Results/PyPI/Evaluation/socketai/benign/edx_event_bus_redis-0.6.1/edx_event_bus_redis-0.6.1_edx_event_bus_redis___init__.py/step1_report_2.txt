{
  "purpose": "Implementing Redis Streams for the Open edX event bus, likely facilitating event publishing and consumption within the system.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'edx_event_bus_redis.internal.consumer' and 'edx_event_bus_redis.internal.producer', which are external modules providing Redis event consumer and producer functionalities.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data leaks. It primarily imports modules and sets a version.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules, which may internally contain data flows; however, no specific source-to-sink data flows are visible in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be straightforward module import and version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two internal modules related to Redis event bus functionality, indicating a modular design. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The version number suggests active development but does not imply malicious intent. The code is minimal and appears to serve as a configuration or entry point, with no risky operations performed directly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module setup with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It mainly facilitates Redis stream handling through external modules, with no embedded malicious or suspicious code.",
