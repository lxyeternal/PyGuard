  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code snippet is minimal: only imports and a version string.\n- All reports agree that no direct data flows, sinks, or suspicious patterns are visible.\n- The primary concern is the import of internal modules, which could potentially contain malicious code, but there's no evidence here.\n- The malware score is consistently zero across all reports, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concern based on this fragment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly imports modules and sets a version. No issues are present.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only concern is the import of internal modules, which could be malicious if those modules are compromised. However, this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.\n\n### Scores & Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 seems reasonable, given the minimal code and the potential concern about internal modules, but no actual malicious activity is demonstrated.\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The reasoning that this is a benign setup module is sound.\n- The concern about internal modules is noted but not substantiated here.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Risk score:** I agree with the low risk score (~0.1). Since no malicious activity is visible, and the code is straightforward, the risk remains minimal.\n- **Malware score:** 0, as there's no evidence of malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- If further analysis of the internal modules (`consumer` and `producer`) reveals malicious code, scores should be adjusted accordingly.\n- The import of internal modules warrants review of those modules' source code to confirm their integrity.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Recommendation | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                      | No malicious code or behavior present in this snippet.     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                      | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.            |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1                    | Minimal risk; concern about internal modules but no evidence. |\n\n**Overall, this code snippet appears benign and safe based on the provided fragment.**",
