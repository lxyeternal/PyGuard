{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up Redis streams for the Open edX event bus, importing consumer and producer components related to Redis event handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules: 'edx_event_bus_redis.internal.consumer' and 'edx_event_bus_redis.internal.producer'. No direct data input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potential data leak points are evident in this fragment. No data is being processed or transmitted here.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows are observable in this code snippet, as it only contains imports and a version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, importing known modules and defining a version.",
  "analysis": "This code imports modules related to Redis event consumers and producers for the Open edX event bus. It contains no input handling, data processing, or network communication in this fragment. The only notable element is the import of internal modules, which are assumed to be part of the package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code constructs. The code appears standard for initializing or configuring components of a Redis-based event bus system.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, benign code snippet setting up Redis event bus components for the Open edX platform. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code within this fragment.",
