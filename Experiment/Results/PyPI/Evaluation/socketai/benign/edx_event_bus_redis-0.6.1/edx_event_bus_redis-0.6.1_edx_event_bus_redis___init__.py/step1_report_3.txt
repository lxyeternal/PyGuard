  "purpose": "Implementing Redis Streams for the Open edX event bus to facilitate event publishing and consumption.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing internal modules 'RedisEventConsumer' and 'create_producer' from 'edx_event_bus_redis.internal' package.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import of internal modules suggests that data flow depends on those modules; no explicit source-to-sink data flow in the visible code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code. The code primarily consists of imports and a version string.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module with descriptive comments, version info, and imports from internal modules related to Redis event handling. No malicious code or suspicious behavior is present. It appears to be a straightforward setup module for an event bus system. Since it only imports components and defines a version, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation component with no signs of malware or security risks. It simply imports necessary internal modules for Redis event bus functionality. No malicious behavior or anomalies are detected.",
