  "purpose": "Minimal setup for Redis streams in the Open edX event bus, importing internal modules for consumer and producer functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'edx_event_bus_redis.internal.consumer' and 'edx_event_bus_redis.internal.producer'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No active data flow; only module imports and version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of data processing, network activity, or suspicious patterns; use of internal modules could be a concern but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing internal modules related to Redis event handling and setting a version string. No data input/output, network connections, or embedded logic is present. The internal modules could potentially contain malicious code, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone. The malware score should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The security risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk due to module imports. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. Overall, the code appears benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal setup for Redis streams in the Open edX event bus system, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
