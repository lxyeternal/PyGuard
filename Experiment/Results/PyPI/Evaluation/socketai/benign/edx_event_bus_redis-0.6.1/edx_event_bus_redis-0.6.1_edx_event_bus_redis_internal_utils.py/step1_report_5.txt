  "purpose": "Utilities for converting between message headers and EventsMetadata objects, including encoding/decoding and header metadata handling.",
  "sources": "Configuration toggle, encoding/decoding functions, and header extraction functions from message headers and metadata objects.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as functions primarily handle data transformations and metadata extraction.",
  "flows": "Headers are extracted and decoded to create metadata objects; metadata objects are encoded back into headers for transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious logic observed. Usage of signal alarm for timeout is typical for enforcing call time limits.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a structured approach for handling message headers and converting them to and from metadata objects, with proper encoding/decoding mechanisms. The usage of lambda functions for transforming data types (e.g., datetime, UUID, int) is standard. The timeout context manager leverages signals for enforcement, which is normal in Python. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The toggle for audit logging is a benign feature for debugging purposes. Overall, the code appears well-structured for its purpose, with no malicious or sabotage elements detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical message header management and data serialization tasks with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It includes standard patterns for data transformation and timeout enforcement. No malware or suspicious anomalies are identified.",
