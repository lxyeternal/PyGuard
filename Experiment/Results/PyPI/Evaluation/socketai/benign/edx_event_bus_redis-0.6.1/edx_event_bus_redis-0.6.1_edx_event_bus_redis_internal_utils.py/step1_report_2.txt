  "purpose": "Utilities for converting between message headers and EventsMetadata objects, including encoding/decoding, header-to-metadata translation, and a timeout context manager.",
  "sources": "Configuration toggles, header processing functions, and input parameters such as message headers and EventsMetadata objects.",
  "sinks": "Decoded header values mapped into EventsMetadata objects, and encoded headers generated from EventsMetadata.",
  "flows": "Headers are decoded from binary, mapped to metadata fields via headers, and vice versa; the timeout context manages signal alarms.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of signal alarms for timeouts could be potentially disruptive but not malicious; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard header encoding/decoding and mapping functions with clear, conventional Python constructs. It uses signal alarms for timeouts, which is a typical approach but can be disruptive if misused. No suspicious or malicious logic, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activities, is present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The toggles and encoding functions are safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for message processing with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It handles header encoding/decoding and includes a timeout context manager without any malicious or suspicious behaviors. Overall, it is safe and aligns with expected patterns for such utilities.",
