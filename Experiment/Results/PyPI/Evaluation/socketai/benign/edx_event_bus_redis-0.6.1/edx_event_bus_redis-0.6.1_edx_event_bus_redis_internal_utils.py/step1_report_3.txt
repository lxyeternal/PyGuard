  "purpose": "Utilities for converting between message headers and EventsMetadata objects, including encoding/decoding, header management, and timeout handling.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: headers (dict), event_metadata (EventsMetadata); internal functions for encoding/decoding; toggle configuration source.",
  "sinks": "Encoding functions convert strings and headers to bytes; get_metadata_from_headers decodes header values; get_headers_from_metadata encodes event metadata to headers.",
  "flows": "Headers are decoded to extract metadata fields; metadata is encoded back into headers; timeout context uses signal to enforce timing constraints.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. Use of signal.alarm for timeout is standard; no network or file operations involved.",
  "analysis": "The code defines message header mappings, encoding/decoding functions, and utility classes for header processing and timeout management. It uses standard Python modules and a toggle for logging configuration. No malicious intent or suspicious activity is evident. The header handling functions process data without executing or transmitting it externally. The timeout class applies a typical signal-based timeout pattern without external side effects. Overall, the code appears to serve legitimate utility functions for message handling in a secure manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for message header processing and timeout handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. It appears to be a standard implementation of message metadata conversion and timeout enforcement with no security risks detected.",
