  "purpose": "Utilities for converting between message headers and EventsMetadata objects, including encoding/decoding, header mapping, and timeout management.",
  "sources": "Header encoding/decoding functions, header-to-metadata and metadata-to-header functions, signal-based timeout context manager.",
  "sinks": "Headers stored as binary data, EventsMetadata object fields.",
  "flows": "Headers are decoded and mapped to metadata fields; metadata fields are encoded back into headers; signal alarm enforces timeouts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward data transformations; use of signal.alarm() for timeouts, which can be disruptive but is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard header serialization/deserialization, mapping, and timeout enforcement using signals. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The signal-based timeout may cause issues in multithreaded environments but does not indicate malicious intent. The toggle for audit logging is benign. Overall, the code is a utility module with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The malware score remains zero; obfuscation is absent; risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2) due to signal use, which is acceptable for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured utility code for message header handling and timeout enforcement. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected. The current security assessment with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and low risk (~0.2) is appropriate.",
