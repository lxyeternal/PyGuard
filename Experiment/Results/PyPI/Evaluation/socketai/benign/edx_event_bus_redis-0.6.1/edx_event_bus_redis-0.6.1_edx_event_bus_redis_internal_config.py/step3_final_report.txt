  "purpose": "Configuration loading and validation for internal use, fetching Redis URL and topic prefix from Django settings.",
  "sources": "Django settings: 'EVENT_BUS_REDIS_CONNECTION_URL' and 'EVENT_BUS_TOPIC_PREFIX'.",
  "sinks": "None; only reads configuration data and constructs strings.",
  "flows": "Reads settings -> issues warnings if missing -> constructs configuration dict or prefixed topic string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward configuration access with no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code safely loads configuration parameters, issues warnings if critical settings are missing, and constructs strings for Redis connection and topic names. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data beyond configuration. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is simple, clear, and appropriate for internal configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration loader with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are correct. The slight security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal operational concern due to missing configs but does not indicate a security vulnerability. Overall, the code is safe and supply chain secure.",
