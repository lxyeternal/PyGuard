  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard Sphinx configuration file.\n- No untrusted input, external data fetching, or code execution is involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The code consists solely of static configuration variables, extension lists, and project metadata.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks are evident.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Config for building documentation.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes no suspicious patterns; standard configuration.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk score:** 0, appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0, justified.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, no external input, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, risk score is 0, both appropriate.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Clear, standard configuration.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0, risk score 0, justified.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0, risk score 0, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence:** The code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration file with no malicious code, no external data handling, and no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate across all reports.\n\n### Final justification:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior or code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk detected.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature. No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical static configuration file with no security concerns.",
