  "sources": "Static configuration variables, commented import statements, extension lists, and project metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input, external data, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for documentation setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Sphinx configuration file containing project info, theme settings, extension lists, and output options. It contains only commented-out import statements and no dynamic or external data handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present. The configuration is typical and benign, with no data sinks or flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration file with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify this, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the content.",
