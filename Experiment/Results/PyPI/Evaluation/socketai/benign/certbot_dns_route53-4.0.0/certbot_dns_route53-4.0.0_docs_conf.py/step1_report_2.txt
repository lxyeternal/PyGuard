  "sources": "Configuration settings, import statements (commented out), and extension list declarations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code primarily sets static configuration parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mostly static assignment and commented code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code consists solely of standard configuration settings for documentation build.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file with no dynamic execution, user input handling, or network operations. It includes only commented-out import statements, configuration variables, and extension lists. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior evident. No suspicious or hidden code is present; the structure is typical for documentation setup.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration file for Sphinx documentation generation. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
