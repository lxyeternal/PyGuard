  "sources": "User inputs for AWS credentials, configuration files, environment variables, and command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data such as AWS access keys and secret keys, which could be leaked if improperly handled.",
  "flows": "AWS credentials are read from environment variables or configuration files; these credentials are then used by the plugin to perform DNS record changes via AWS API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors, and no obfuscated code. The document is purely descriptive and instructive.",
  "analysis": "The code is a detailed documentation excerpt for configuring and using the certbot DNS Route 53 plugin. It explains how credentials should be supplied securely via environment variables or configuration files, and emphasizes protecting these credentials. There is no executable code or malicious instructions. It provides sample configuration snippets and guidance for proper security practices. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present, and the code does not perform any actions by itself. Its primary function is to instruct users on secure setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, instructional documentation piece with no malicious intent. It emphasizes security best practices for handling AWS credentials and provides usage examples. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided text.",
