  "sinks": "API calls to AWS Route 53 service for DNS record management, credential usage in API requests.",
  "flows": "Credentials sourced from environment variables or config files flow into AWS API calls; user commands trigger DNS challenge processes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is purely informational documentation with no executable code or data processing. It describes credential handling securely, emphasizing protection of AWS keys. No data flows involve untrusted sources executing code, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The documentation correctly reflects safe practices, with a minimal security concern related to credential handling, which is properly described and not embedded. No obfuscation or malware behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor security consideration is the handling of AWS credentials, which is properly documented and does not pose an actual risk. The overall security risk score is 0, malware score is 0, and obfuscation score is 0.",
