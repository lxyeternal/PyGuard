  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for the certbot-dns-route53 package, defining dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SNAP_BUILD' influencing dependency list, package metadata, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; dependencies are controlled, and no code executes based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check affects which dependencies are installed; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with typical conditional dependency inclusion based on environment variable.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard packaging script with no malicious or suspicious logic. The environment variable 'SNAP_BUILD' only influences dependency inclusion, which is a common pattern. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The dependency management based on environment variables does not pose a security risk in this context. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The environment variable influence is typical and does not introduce risk. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk are appropriate.",
