  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'certbot-dns-route53' plugin, defining dependencies, package info, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SNAP_BUILD' for conditional dependency inclusion.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or data leaks; environment variables are used for configuration control.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'SNAP_BUILD' influences dependency list; no other data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable 'SNAP_BUILD' to conditionally modify dependencies is standard; no hardcoded credentials or malicious behavior observed. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package setup and dependency management, with conditional inclusion of dependencies based on environment variables. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. All dependencies are standard for setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present. The code structure and formatting are typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It conditionally manages dependencies based on an environment variable, which is common in build environments. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
