{
  "purpose": "The code sets up and configures a Python package for the Certbot DNS Route53 plugin, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SNAP_BUILD', hardcoded version, and package metadata",
  "sinks": "Installation dependencies (install_requires), entry points",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences dependencies, package setup reads static metadata, entry points define plugin locations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials or secret tokens; dependencies and package info appear standard",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: importing modules, defining dependencies, conditionally adding packages based on environment variables, and configuring package metadata and entry points. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. The environment variable 'SNAP_BUILD' influences dependencies but does not introduce malicious logic. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no network activity or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package without malicious intent. It manages dependencies and plugin entry points safely and in a typical manner. No security risks or malware detected.",
