{
  "purpose": "This code generates a secure upload URL with an expiration time and a signature to authenticate the upload request.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, environment variable 'FLET_SECRET_KEY', and internal functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptographic functions (hmac, hashlib) to generate signatures; potentially vulnerable if secret_key is compromised.",
  "flows": "Secret key (from parameter or environment) is used to create HMAC signatures based on expiration time and URL parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Uses environment variable for secret key, which is common; no hardcoded secrets or credentials. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a URL with an expiration time and signs it using HMAC with SHA-256. Secret key can be supplied via parameter or environment variable, which is standard. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The cryptographic operations are standard and appear correctly implemented. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected. The use of environment variables for secret key management is normal practice. Overall, the code is designed for secure URL generation, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation for generating signed upload URLs with expiration, employing cryptographic best practices. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The only concern could be if the secret key is leaked or misused, but this is outside the scope of the code itself.",
