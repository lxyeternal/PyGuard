  "purpose": "Generate secure upload URLs with signatures for authenticated access.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'FLET_SECRET_KEY', function parameters 'secret_key', input data such as 'file_name', 'expires_in_seconds', and 'upload_endpoint_path'.",
  "sinks": "HMAC signing process using secret key, generating URL with signature appended as query parameter.",
  "flows": "Input secret key or environment variable -> signature generation via HMAC -> URL construction with signature.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Uses environment variable fallback for secret key. No obfuscated or unusual code constructs. Signature generation follows standard HMAC procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an upload URL with an expiration time and a cryptographic signature to ensure authenticity. It uses environment variables and parameters for secret key management, avoiding hardcoded secrets. The signature creation employs standard cryptographic methods without suspicious or malicious behavior. No data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The code's purpose aligns with secure URL signing, typical for supply chain integrity. Overall, no malicious intent or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code securely generates signed URLs for uploads, adhering to best practices. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are present. It is a standard implementation for secure URL signing with proper secret key management.",
