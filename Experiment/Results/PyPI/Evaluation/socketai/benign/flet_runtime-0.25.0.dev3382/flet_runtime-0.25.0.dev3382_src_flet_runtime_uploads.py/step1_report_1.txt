  "purpose": "Generate secure upload URLs with expiration and signature validation for file uploads.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable FLET_SECRET_KEY, reading function parameters such as upload_endpoint_path, file_name, expires_in_seconds, and secret_key, and current time via datetime.now.",
  "sinks": "HMAC signing process which uses secret_key (from parameter or environment variable) and constructs a signature for URL validation.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variable or parameter -> signature generation using HMAC with secret key and expiration time -> URL construction with signed hash.",
  "anomalies": "The code allows secret key override via environment variable, which is standard, but no evidence of malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets are present. No suspicious or obfuscated code. Signature generation process is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an upload URL with an expiration timestamp and a cryptographic signature for validation. The secret key is sourced either from a parameter or environment variable, providing flexibility. The signature uses HMAC with SHA-256, which is secure if secret key is kept confidential. The process is standard for signed URL generation and does not contain malicious behavior or backdoors. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate URL signing for secure uploads, adhering to standard security practices. No malicious behavior or backdoors are detected. It does not appear to be malicious or maliciously sabotaged.",
