  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims with the provided code, and evaluate their scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of signed URL generation using HMAC with SHA-256.\n- Secret key management involves either a parameter or an environment variable, which is standard practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The cryptographic process appears correctly implemented.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are evident.\n- The code's purpose aligns with secure URL signing for upload endpoints.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Generate secure upload URLs with expiration and signature validation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is standard, secure, and free of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The low security risk score seems reasonable given the context, and malware is correctly scored as 0.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Generate a secure upload URL with expiration and signature.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard cryptographic practices and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Also accurate. The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Generate signed URL with expiration for secure uploads.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies standard HMAC usage, environment variable handling, and no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Generate signed URL with expiration.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurately describes the process, no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-founded. The slightly lower security risk score and higher confidence are justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Generate signed URLs for uploads.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code's purpose and behavior, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no malicious activity or backdoor.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2). Given the code is standard and secure, these are reasonable. The risk mainly hinges on secret key management, which is handled properly.\n\n### **Potential adjustments:**\n\n- The **security risk scores** could be uniformly set to **0.0** since the code demonstrates standard, secure practices without evident vulnerabilities.\n- The **malware scores** are correctly 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 — no evident security risks; secret key handling is standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. The code is a standard, secure implementation of signed URL generation for file uploads, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, though a conservative approach might set the security risk to zero.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The overall assessment indicates **no malicious or suspicious activity** in this code snippet.",
