  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scoring, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code constructs signed URLs for uploads, using HMAC with SHA-256, with expiration timestamps.\n- The secret key is sourced either from a parameter or environment variable, which is standard practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The cryptographic process appears correctly implemented and secure.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Generate secure upload URLs with expiration and signature validation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0\n- **Analysis:** Valid, standard implementation. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is legitimate and secure.\n\n**Assessment:** The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk score of 0.2 seems slightly conservative, but given the reliance on environment variables and standard cryptography, it's acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Generate secure upload URL with expiration and signature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; standard cryptographic practices.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** Malware score remains appropriate at 0. The security risk score is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Generate signed URL with expiration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0\n- **Analysis:** Same reasoning; no suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Generate signed URL with expiration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95, obfuscated=0\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; very standard implementation.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Generate signed URL for uploads.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0\n- **Analysis:** Same as previous; standard cryptographic signing.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, matching the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1-0.2) reflects conservative assessment of secret key handling, but since the code is standard and no secrets are hardcoded, these are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The code is a standard, secure implementation of signed URL generation.\n- No evidence suggests malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are consistent and justified based on the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (very low, mainly due to reliance on environment variables, which is standard)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a well-implemented, standard secure URL signing mechanism with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
