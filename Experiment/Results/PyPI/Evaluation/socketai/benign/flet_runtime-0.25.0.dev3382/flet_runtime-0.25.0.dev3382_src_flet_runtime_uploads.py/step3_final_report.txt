{
  "purpose": "Generate a signed URL for secure file uploads with expiration, using HMAC SHA-256 for signature validation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'FLET_SECRET_KEY' or the 'secret_key' parameter; URL path and query string components.",
  "sinks": "The generated URL containing the signature and expiration timestamp.",
  "flows": "Secret key (from env or parameter) + expiration timestamp + URL path and filename → HMAC signing → URL with appended signature.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward cryptographic implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements URL signing with HMAC SHA-256, sourcing the secret key securely from environment or parameter, constructing an expiration timestamp, and generating a signature over the URL components. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present. The code aligns with standard secure practices for URL signing. The scores from reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior. The secret key management is appropriate, and no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of signed URL generation for uploads, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws. The assigned scores are justified and accurate.",
