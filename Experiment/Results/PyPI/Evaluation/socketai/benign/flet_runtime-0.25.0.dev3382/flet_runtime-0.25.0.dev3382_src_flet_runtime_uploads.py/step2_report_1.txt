  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Purpose: Generate signed URLs with expiration for secure file uploads.\n- Key operations: Uses environment variable or parameter for secret key, constructs URL with expiration timestamp, signs data with HMAC SHA-256, appends signature to URL.\n- Observations: Standard cryptographic practices, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No. The code appears to correctly implement signed URL generation with standard practices. The secret key is sourced from environment or parameter, the signature uses HMAC SHA-256, and the URL includes expiration and signature parameters.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  No apparent logical errors or security flaws. The process is straightforward and aligns with common secure URL signing methods.\n\n---\n\n### Score analysis:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of **0**.\n- **Justification:**  \n  The code performs cryptographic signing for URL validation, which is a standard security measure. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection.  \n  **Conclusion:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign an obfuscated score of **0**.\n- **Justification:**  \n  The code is clear, straightforward, and readable. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- Reports give scores between **0.1** and **0.2**.\n- **Justification:**  \n  The only potential concern is secret key management. Since the secret key is either provided or sourced from an environment variable, the risk is minimal if secrets are handled properly. The cryptographic process itself is secure.  \n  **Conclusion:** The low risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Logical consistency:\n- The reports consistently describe the code as standard, secure, and free of malicious behavior.\n- No report suggests any suspicious assumptions or misinterpretations.\n- The high confidence levels (0.9-0.95) are justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1-0.2 (low, standard cryptographic practices)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard URL signing with secret key management)\n\nThis code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented secure URL signing utility with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
