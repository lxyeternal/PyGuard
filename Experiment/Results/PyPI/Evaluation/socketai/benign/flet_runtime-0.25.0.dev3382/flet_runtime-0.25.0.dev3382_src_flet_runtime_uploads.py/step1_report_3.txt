{
  "purpose": "The code generates a signed upload URL with an expiration time, used for securely uploading files with time-limited access.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'FLET_SECRET_KEY', input parameters 'upload_endpoint_path', 'file_name', 'expires_in_seconds', and optional 'secret_key'.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'hmac' library to generate signatures, which are then included in URLs; potential exposure if secrets are mishandled.",
  "flows": "Secret key (from parameter or environment variable) flows into HMAC signature generation; URL components (file name, expiration) are included in the signature process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or obfuscation. Uses standard cryptographic practices. No hardcoded credentials aside from environment variable. No malicious network activity or system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a URL with an expiration timestamp and signs it using HMAC with SHA-256, utilizing a secret key either passed explicitly or from an environment variable. The process is standard for generating secure, time-limited URLs for uploads. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. All data flows are within expected parameters for URL signing. No anomalous or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a typical secure URL signing mechanism for upload endpoints without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It properly handles secret key management via environment variables or parameters. There are no indications of malicious activity or security risks in this code.",
