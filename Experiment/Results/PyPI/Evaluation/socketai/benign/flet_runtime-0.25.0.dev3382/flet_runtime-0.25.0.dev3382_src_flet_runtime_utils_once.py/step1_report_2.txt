{
  "purpose": "Implement a concurrency control mechanism to ensure a function is executed only once in an asynchronous context.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; uses class initialization and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Calls the provided function 'func' with given arguments; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Method 'do' checks '_done' flag, acquires lock, executes 'func', and sets '_done' to True, preventing re-execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. The class implements a common singleton-like pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an 'Once' class that ensures a given asynchronous function is executed only once, even in concurrent scenarios. It uses an asyncio lock to prevent race conditions. The implementation appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. There are no external data sources, no suspicious data flows, and no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard concurrency control utility to execute a function once. No malicious behavior, no security risks detected. The implementation is clear and aligns with typical patterns for such functionality.",
