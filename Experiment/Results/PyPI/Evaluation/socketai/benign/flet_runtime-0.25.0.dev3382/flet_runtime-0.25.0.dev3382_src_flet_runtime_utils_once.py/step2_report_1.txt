  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code implements a class `Once` designed to ensure an asynchronous function executes only once, even under concurrent conditions. The core logic involves checking a `_done` flag, acquiring an asyncio lock, rechecking, executing the function, and then setting `_done` to True. This pattern is standard for such use cases.\n\n2. **Anomalies & Malicious Indicators**:  \n   The reports uniformly state that no anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears straightforward, with no external data sources, no data leaks, or backdoors.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Reasonableness of Scores**:  \n   All reports assign a security risk score of 0 and malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity. Given the code's purpose and implementation, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n4. **Assessment of Potential Vulnerabilities**:  \n   The only potential concern might be if the `func` parameter is malicious or untrusted, but the code itself doesn't introduce vulnerabilities—it's a utility wrapper. The actual behavior depends on the functions passed to `do()`, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n5. **Consistency & Justification**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports, all indicating no malware, no obfuscation, and no security risk. The confidence level is 1, reflecting certainty in the analysis.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:  \n   Since the code is a common concurrency pattern, there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The use of `asyncio.Lock` and the `_done` flag is appropriate and standard.\n\n**Final Estimation & Recommendations**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of a concurrency control utility to execute an async function once. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior is present. The reported scores are appropriate and justified based on the provided code and analysis.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nI agree with the current assessments. The code is safe, straightforward, and poses no security threat.",
