{
  "purpose": "A utility class 'Once' designed to ensure an asynchronous function executes only once, even under concurrent calls.",
  "sources": "The 'do' method reads the '_done' flag and receives the 'func' parameter as input; the 'func' is called within the method.",
  "sinks": "The 'func' function is invoked with provided arguments; no external data flows or leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Check '_done' -> acquire lock -> recheck '_done' -> execute 'func' -> set '_done' to True.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard concurrency pattern using asyncio.Lock and a boolean flag to ensure a function runs only once. It correctly employs double-checked locking to prevent race conditions. No external data sources, secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The pattern is common and safe. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, with no anomalies or suspicious features. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and justified given the straightforward implementation. The confidence level is high (1), as the code is clear, standard, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an async 'execute once' utility. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current reports and scores are accurate and justified.",
