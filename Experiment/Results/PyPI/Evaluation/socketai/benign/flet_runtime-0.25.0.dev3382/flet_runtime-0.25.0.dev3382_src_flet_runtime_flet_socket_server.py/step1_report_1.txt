{
  "purpose": "Implements a WebSocket-like server using asyncio for handling client connections, messages, and commands for a web framework (Flet).",
  "sources": "Reads data from network connections via asyncio streams; reads and processes JSON messages.",
  "sinks": "Processes messages that may contain commands, client registration, and page events; sends data back through network streams.",
  "flows": "Incoming data from network connections -> __on_message -> message processing -> possible invocation of session or event handlers; outgoing commands/messages -> __send -> network stream.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic JSON decoding and task creation without explicit input validation; no hardcoded credentials; uses random_string for UDS path; no insecure environment variable or insecure SQL observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a server for handling WebSocket-like connections via asyncio, with mechanisms for starting on TCP or UDS, receiving and decoding JSON messages, and dispatching tasks based on message actions. It manages session registration, web client registration, and page events. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The use of json.loads and dynamic task creation appears standard. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe data handling are present. Random string generation is used solely for UDS path creation, which is normal. The server handles cleanup and connection closure appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate server implementation for a web framework, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malicious payloads. It performs standard network I/O, message processing, and task management without suspicious or malicious code patterns.",
