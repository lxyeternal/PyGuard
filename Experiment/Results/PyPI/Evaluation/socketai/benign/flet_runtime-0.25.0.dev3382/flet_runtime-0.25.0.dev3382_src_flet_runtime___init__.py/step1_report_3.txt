  "purpose": "Import necessary modules and classes from the flet_core library for building a web or desktop application interface.",
  "sources": "Import statements from flet_core, flet_core.pubsub, and flet_runtime.app",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output or untrusted data handling identified",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data processing observed in import statements",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected in the import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, which are used to include modules and classes from external libraries. These modules appear to be part of a framework for building applications, with no signs of malicious code or obfuscation. No functions, data handling, or dynamic code execution is present that could indicate malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, consisting only of import statements necessary for an application built with the 'flet_core' framework. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security issues are evident.",
