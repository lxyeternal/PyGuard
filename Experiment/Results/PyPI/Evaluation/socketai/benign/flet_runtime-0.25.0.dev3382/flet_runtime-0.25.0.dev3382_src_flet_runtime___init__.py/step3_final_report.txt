  "purpose": "Import statements for setting up a Flet application, importing core modules and components.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'flet_core', 'flet_core.pubsub', 'flet_core.types', and 'flet_runtime.app'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static imports without data handling or execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from well-known, reputable libraries related to the Flet framework. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. The import of 'PubSubClient' and application setup components ('app', 'app_async') indicates typical application initialization, not malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected. The code is standard setup code for a Python Flet application, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements from legitimate libraries. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk present. The scores are appropriate and align with the analysis.",
