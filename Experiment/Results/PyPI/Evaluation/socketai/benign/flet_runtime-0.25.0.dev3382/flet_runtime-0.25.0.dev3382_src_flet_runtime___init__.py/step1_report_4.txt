  "purpose": "Import necessary modules and components from the 'flet_core' and 'flet_runtime' libraries for a web or app-based project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'flet_core', 'flet_core.pubsub', 'flet_core.types', and 'flet_runtime.app'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leakage or malicious actions are present; no untrusted data handling or network operations are visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is apparent in these import statements; these are just module imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements that include core modules, pubsub components, type definitions, and app initializations. No functions, data processing, or network activities are shown. The imported modules are standard for a Python web or app framework and do not indicate malicious intent. The code appears straightforward and conventional, focusing on setting up the environment.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is benign, consisting only of import statements for setting up an application using the 'flet' framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues in this code segment.",
