  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe only import statements from the 'flet_core' and 'flet_runtime' packages.\n- No functions, data processing, network activity, or external communications are present.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is identified.\n- The scores assigned are all zero or very low, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and logical consistency:\n\n**1. Are the reported issues present?**  \nYes. All reports correctly identify that the code only consists of import statements with no malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n**2. Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \nNo. The reasoning is consistent, and the conclusion that these snippets are benign is sound.\n\n**3. Are the scores reasonable?**  \n- Malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate given the benign imports.\n- Security risk scores are zero, matching the absence of vulnerabilities.\n- Obfuscated scores are zero, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \nNone of these snippets warrant a higher risk score since they are only import statements with no suspicious activity.\n\n**5. Malware scores:**  \nCorrectly set to 0, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**6. Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \nNo such claims are made; all assessments are consistent with the code.\n\n**7. Score consistency:**  \nScores are consistent across reports, reflecting the benign and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the analysis, **the code snippets are purely import statements** with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis is a typical setup code for a Flet application, and there are no security concerns based solely on these import statements.",
