  "purpose": "Utility functions for environment detection, filesystem operations, network info retrieval, and platform identification.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, filesystem paths, network sockets, platform system calls, user input via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "File reading (e.g., /proc/version), socket connections, environment variable access, subprocess calls (indirectly via webbrowser), file extraction (tar files)",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence platform detection; socket functions provide network info; file operations read and write data; tar extraction checks prevent path traversal",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets; no obfuscated code; standard security checks in place",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries for environment detection, filesystem, and network info. It includes security measures such as path traversal prevention in tar extraction. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The functions are straightforward, serve legitimate purposes, and do not perform dynamic code execution or data exfiltration. The malware scores are zero, obfuscation scores are zero, and security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with benign utility code. Confidence in this assessment is high (above 0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of utility functions with appropriate security practices. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are accurate and should remain as such.",
