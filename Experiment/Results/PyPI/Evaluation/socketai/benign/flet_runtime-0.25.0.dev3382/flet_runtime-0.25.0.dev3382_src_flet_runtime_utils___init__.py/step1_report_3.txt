  "purpose": "Utility functions for environment detection, file operations, network checks, and system info, likely for a Python package related to web or platform-specific behavior.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (FLET_PLATFORM, FLET_WEB_PATH), system calls (platform.system(), os.environ), socket connections, file system reads (platform info, version files), script arguments, and file input (calculate_file_hash).",
  "sinks": "Web browser opening, file extraction (tar), socket creation and IP retrieval, file hashing, copying files, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → platform detection functions → network/socket functions; script args/path functions → file hashing and copying.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. Use of os.getenv() for environment config, which is normal. The function 'safe_tar_extractall' properly checks for path traversal. No suspicious network addresses or data exfiltration behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of environment and platform detection, file and network utilities, and system info retrieval. Functions like 'which' perform executable lookup, and 'get_free_tcp_port' and 'get_local_ip' access network info. The 'safe_tar_extractall' function implements a security check to prevent path traversal, indicating awareness of security. No suspicious or malicious code segments, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors. Overall, it appears as utility code intended for platform-aware operations with standard security precautions.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a set of utility functions for environment detection, file handling, and network info. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or malicious intent. No indicators of malware, data theft, or sabotage are present. The code appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
