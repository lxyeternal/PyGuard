  "conclusion": "The code is benign and functions as a platform-specific launcher for external binaries, with the main security concern being the lack of verification for downloaded files. There is no malicious intent or malicious code present. The supply chain risk should be mitigated by adding checksum or signature verification for downloads. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.4), primarily due to the unverified external binary downloads."
