{
  "purpose": "Define a User class that extends a dictionary to include user-specific attributes such as id and groups.",
  "sources": "Initialization method (__init__) with input parameters 'kwargs' and 'id'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "Input 'kwargs' used to initialize the dictionary; 'id' and 'groups' are assigned as object attributes, not affecting external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious variable names or unusual code patterns. The class simply extends dict with additional attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of dict with a constructor that initializes the dictionary with provided keyword arguments and sets additional attributes 'id' and 'groups'. There is no apparent malicious behavior, no external data transfer, and no risky code constructs. The code appears straightforward and standard for user data modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class extension for user data storage with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not contain security risks or obfuscation.",
