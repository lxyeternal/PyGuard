  "purpose": "Defines a User class extending dict, adding id and groups attributes for user data storage.",
  "sources": "Initialization with kwargs dictionary, setting self.id and self.groups attributes.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data leaks; no external communication or data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from kwargs into the dict superclass; attributes id and groups are set directly; no external untrusted data processing or network flows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of mutable default attribute 'groups' which could lead to shared state, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward subclass of dict with additional attributes. It does not process external untrusted data beyond initialization, nor does it perform network, file, or cryptographic operations. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The only minor concern is the mutable 'groups' list, which is a common pattern but could be improved for safety. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscated score of 0, with high confidence. No logical flaws or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe data container class with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
