{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to modify HTML and JSON files, specifically to inject dynamic content and update app metadata for a web application.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'index_path' and 'manifest_path'; user-supplied parameters such as 'base_href', 'websocket_endpoint_path', 'app_name', 'app_description', 'pyodide_script_path'.",
  "sinks": "Writing to the same files 'index_path' and 'manifest_path'.",
  "flows": "Data from user parameters flows into file content modifications, replacing placeholders or injecting code, then writes back to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious network calls; code performs straightforward file reading, string replacement, and JSON manipulation. Use of regex for HTML content replacement is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads HTML and JSON files, updates placeholders or metadata based on user parameters, and writes the updated content back. There are no inputs from untrusted sources such as network or environment variables. No suspicious or malicious code, such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network activity, is present. The dynamic content injection via string replacement and regex is standard for configuration or templating scripts. The code appears to serve legitimate purposes related to web app deployment configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate file modifications for web app configuration, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It lacks suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code appears safe based on the provided content.",
