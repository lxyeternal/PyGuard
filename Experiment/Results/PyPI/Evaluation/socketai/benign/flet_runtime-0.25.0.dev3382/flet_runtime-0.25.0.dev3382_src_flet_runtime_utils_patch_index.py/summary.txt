  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration utility that modifies static files. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is injection risk due to lack of input sanitization, but this does not constitute malicious behavior. Overall, the code is safe, with a minor potential vulnerability that can be mitigated by input validation."
