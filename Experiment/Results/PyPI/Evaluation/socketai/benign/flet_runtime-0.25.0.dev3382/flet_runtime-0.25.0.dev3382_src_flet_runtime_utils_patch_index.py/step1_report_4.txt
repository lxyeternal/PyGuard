  "purpose": "The code provides functions to modify HTML and JSON files for web app configuration, such as patching index.html and manifest.json with custom parameters.",
  "sources": "File reads from index_path and manifest_path; parameters passed to functions (e.g., base_href, app_name, app_description, pyodide_script_path, websocket_endpoint_path).",
  "sinks": "Writing back to the same files after modification; replacing placeholders and updating meta tags and JSON keys.",
  "flows": "Read files -> modify content based on parameters -> write back to files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string replacement for injecting JavaScript code and HTML meta tags; dynamic content generation is straightforward but includes no validation or sanitization, which could lead to injection issues if inputs are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs file I/O and string replacements to customize HTML and JSON files for web deployment. It reads HTML content, replaces placeholders with dynamically generated script tags or meta tags based on input parameters, and updates JSON configuration data. There are no suspicious network operations, no code injection or malicious payloads, and no hidden behaviors. The use of string replacement for injecting code could be risky if inputs are externally controlled, but within the scope of this code, it appears to be straightforward configuration updating without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration modification utility for web app files. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or malware. The dynamic content injection via string replacement is typical for templating but could pose security risks if inputs are not sanitized, though no such validation is present here. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
