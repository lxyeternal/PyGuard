{
  "purpose": "The code reads, modifies, and writes HTML and JSON files for web application configuration, inserting scripts, meta tags, and updating manifest data based on provided parameters.",
  "sources": "File reads from specified HTML and JSON files; parameters passed into functions (e.g., index_path, manifest_path, app_name, app_description, etc.).",
  "sinks": "Writing back to the same files after string replacements and regex substitutions; potential injection points if inputs are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Inputs (parameters) flow into string replacements and regex substitutions, which modify file contents before writing back to disk.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting and regex replacements directly with external parameters without sanitization; no validation or escaping of input data.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static file modifications, injecting scripts and meta tags based on parameters. It reads file contents, performs string replacements and regex substitutions, then writes back. No network activity, code execution, or obfuscation is present. The main security concern is potential injection if inputs are malicious, but no malicious code or payloads are detected. The code is straightforward and benign, with the only risk being injection vulnerabilities due to lack of input sanitization. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious intent or behavior. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and readable. The risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the potential for injection if inputs are untrusted, but no active exploitation or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration utility that modifies static files. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is injection risk due to lack of input sanitization, but this does not constitute malicious behavior. Overall, the code is safe, with a minor potential vulnerability that can be mitigated by input validation.",
