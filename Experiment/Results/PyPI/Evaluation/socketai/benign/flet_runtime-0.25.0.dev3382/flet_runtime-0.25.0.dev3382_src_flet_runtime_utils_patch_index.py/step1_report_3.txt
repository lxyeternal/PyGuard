{
  "purpose": "The code modifies HTML and JSON manifest files for a web application, specifically updating meta tags, script content, and app metadata.",
  "sources": "File reads from 'index_path' and 'manifest_path', and user-provided parameters such as 'base_href', 'websocket_endpoint_path', 'app_name', 'app_description', etc.",
  "sinks": "File writes to 'index_path' and 'manifest_path' after modifications; no data leaks or external outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads into string manipulations, then writes back to the same files; user inputs influence the content inserted into files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string replacement and regex for injecting dynamic content into HTML/JSON; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads and modifies HTML and JSON files by replacing placeholders with user-supplied data. The code uses standard file I/O, string replacements, and regex substitutions. There are no apparent signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code. The dynamic insertion of user data into files is controlled and does not involve executing code or command injection. No suspicious patterns like hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard file manipulation tasks for web app configuration and does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks based on its logic. It modifies files based on parameters provided, with no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
