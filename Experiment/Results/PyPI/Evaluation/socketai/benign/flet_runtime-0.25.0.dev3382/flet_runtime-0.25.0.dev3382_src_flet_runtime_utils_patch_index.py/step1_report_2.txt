{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to modify HTML and JSON manifest files for a web application, dynamically injecting values such as base href, WebSocket endpoint, app name, description, and rendering options.",
  "sources": "Input files include the 'index_path' (HTML file) and 'manifest_path' (JSON file). The function reads these files from the filesystem. Parameters such as 'base_href', 'websocket_endpoint_path', 'app_name', and 'app_description' are input data used to replace placeholders or inject content.",
  "sinks": "The code writes modified content back to the same files ('index_path' and 'manifest_path'). It also generates script tags and meta tags that are injected into the HTML, potentially influencing the web page's behavior.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters into replacements within file contents. For example, 'base_href' affects the '<base>' tag, 'websocket_endpoint_path' updates a meta tag, and 'app_name'/'app_description' update meta and title tags. The 'pyodide_script_path' influences embedded script content. The code reads files, modifies string contents, then writes back.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code segments, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors, are present. The use of regex for replacement is standard. No external network requests, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. The code functions solely to update static HTML/JSON templates.",
  "analysis": "The script performs file reading and writing operations with string manipulations for injecting dynamic values. The only dynamic content involves replacing placeholders or inserting scripts and meta tags based on parameters. No code injection, remote code execution, or malicious data handling is evident. The code adheres to common practices for template modification. The only notable aspect is the replacement of placeholders, which is benign in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for updating HTML and manifest files with provided configuration values. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. Its purpose is configuration management for web app deployment. Based on the analysis, there is no indication of security risks or malicious intent.",
