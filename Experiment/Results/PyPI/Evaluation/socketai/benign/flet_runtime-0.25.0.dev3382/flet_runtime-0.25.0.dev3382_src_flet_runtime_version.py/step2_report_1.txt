  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The original code is a straightforward import and attribute access to retrieve the version of the `flet_core` library.\n   - All reports confirm that the code performs a benign, standard operation with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n   - There are no signs of data leakage, external effects, or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, simple, and performs only version retrieval.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (high confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity or security concern, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher score would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or behaviors.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on straightforward code analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I concur with the reports' assessments. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present, and the risk is negligible.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| Malware          | 0            |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            |\n| Security Risk    | 0            |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a harmless utility snippet for version retrieval with no security concerns.",
