  "purpose": "Retrieve the current version of the flet_core library.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'import flet_core.version' and attribute access 'flet_core.version.version'.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to variable 'version' (no external sinks or data leaks).",
  "flows": "Import -> Access attribute -> Assign to variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code; straightforward version retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific module and accesses a version attribute, performing a simple, benign operation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is purely informational, with no external data input/output or network activity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The code is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless utility snippet for version retrieval with no security concerns. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
