  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**  \nAll reports describe a simple import and attribute access pattern to retrieve a version string from `flet_core.version`. The original code matches this description. There are no indications of errors, obfuscation, or malicious code in the original snippet. The code is straightforward and functions as intended.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \nThe reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of anomalies. This aligns with the code's simplicity. No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the lack of obfuscation.  \n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified as the code performs a simple version retrieval without side effects or external interactions.\n\n4. **Justification for any higher risk scores:**  \nSince there's no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \nAll reports correctly avoid speculative claims; they focus on the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \nScores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nThe code is a standard utility snippet for version retrieval, common in many projects, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nBased on the review, I agree with the assigned scores. The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks. The scores accurately reflect the analysis.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are correct, and no adjustments are necessary.",
