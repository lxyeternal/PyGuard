  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:\n   - The original code imports `flet_core.version` and assigns `flet_core.version.version` to a variable `version`.\n   - All reports agree that this is a straightforward version retrieval operation with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or data leakage.\n   - There are no anomalies, suspicious constructs, or complex logic involved.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:\n   - No errors or flaws are evident in the reports. The code is simple and correct for its purpose.\n   - The import statement and attribute access are standard practice for obtaining package version info.\n\n3. **Score Review and Justification**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present, the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores**:\n   - The `malware` score is 0 across all reports, which is justified because the code performs no malicious actions.\n   - The `securityRisk` score is also 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, as there is no obfuscation.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that this code is benign.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code simply retrieves version info.\n\n6. **Consistency and Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code's purpose is purely informational, and it does not involve any data input/output, network activity, or dynamic execution.\n- All evidence points to a benign, standard utility snippet.\n\n**Summary**: The code is safe, straightforward, and poses no security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.",
