  "purpose": "Retrieve and store the current version of the flet_core library",
  "sources": "import statement: import flet_core.version, and reading attribute: flet_core.version.version",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or security effects; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems",
  "flows": "Import module -> access version attribute -> store in variable",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import and attribute access without obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific submodule of flet_core, then accesses its version attribute. This is a straightforward operation to determine the library version. No input from external untrusted sources, no data leaks, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version retrieval of a Python library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
