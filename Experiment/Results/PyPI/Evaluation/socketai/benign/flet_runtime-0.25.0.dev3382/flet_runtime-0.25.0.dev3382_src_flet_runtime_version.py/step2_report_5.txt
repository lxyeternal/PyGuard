  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the claims, the scoring, and the overall security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: importing `flet_core.version` and retrieving `flet_core.version.version`.\n- The code is straightforward, with no input/output, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature described.\n- The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- The security risk is scored at 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's behavior:\n- The code **does** import `flet_core.version` and access `flet_core.version.version`.\n- The variable `version` stores the version string, which is typical for such utility code.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code performs a benign, standard operation to retrieve a library's version. No issues are present.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports is correct. No malicious activity is suggested or detectable.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate, as there's no security risk involved.\n\n**Any adjustments?**  \nNo, the scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying the benign nature.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are unjustified.\n- The code does not perform any data leakage, network communication, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a harmless version retrieval snippet with no security concerns.**",
