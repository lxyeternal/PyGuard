  "purpose": "Retrieve and store the current version of the flet_core library.",
  "sources": "Import statement `import flet_core.version` and access to `flet_core.version.version`",
  "sinks": "Assignment to the variable `version` (no data leakage or external effects)",
  "flows": "Import `flet_core.version` -> access `flet_core.version.version` -> assign to `version`",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import and attribute access without obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific submodule from the `flet_core` package, then retrieves the `version` attribute from that submodule and assigns it to a local variable. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. It uses standard import and attribute access, which is typical for version retrieval in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply retrieves the version information of the `flet_core` package and stores it locally. It performs no malicious actions or security risks. There is no evidence of obfuscation or malware.",
