  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**  \nAll reports confirm that the code simply imports `flet_core.version` and accesses `flet_core.version.version`, assigning it to a variable. The code is straightforward, with no evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks. The purpose is purely to retrieve the version number of the `flet_core` package.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code performs a benign version retrieval operation. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent. They correctly note the absence of suspicious behaviors or anomalies.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and clarity.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as network calls, code execution, or data exfiltration.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all evidence points to a straightforward, harmless version check, there is no justification for higher scores. The code does not introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**  \nThe malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports. There is no indication of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as a simple version retrieval.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (correct, no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (correct, code is straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score:** **0** (correct, no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard, benign utility snippet for retrieving a package version. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### My personal estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
