  "purpose": "Importing authentication-related classes from the flet_runtime.auth package for managing authorization, groups, OAuth providers, tokens, and users.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'flet_runtime.auth' modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows observed in the provided code",
  "flows": "No data flow paths present; only imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a standard library module related to authentication. No functions, data handling, or executable code are present that could be exploited. Importing modules itself is a benign action. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated patterns, or unusual behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of import statements for authentication classes. It shows no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
