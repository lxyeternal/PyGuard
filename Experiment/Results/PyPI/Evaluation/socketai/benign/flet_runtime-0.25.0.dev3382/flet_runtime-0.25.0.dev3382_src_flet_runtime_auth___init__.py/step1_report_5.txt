  "purpose": "Importing various authentication and authorization modules from the 'flet_runtime.auth' package for handling user authentication, authorization, groups, OAuth providers, OAuth tokens, and users.",
  "sources": "Import statements accessing modules within the 'flet_runtime.auth' package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no untrusted data processing or external output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow is apparent within this code; it only imports modules without executing any functions or processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are present in these import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for authentication-related modules. There is no data input, no processing, no external network activity, or any suspicious constructs. The imports suggest preparation for authentication handling but do not perform any malicious activity by themselves. The code is standard for setting up authentication components in a Python application.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only standard import statements for authentication modules with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger application setup rather than malicious or suspicious code.",
