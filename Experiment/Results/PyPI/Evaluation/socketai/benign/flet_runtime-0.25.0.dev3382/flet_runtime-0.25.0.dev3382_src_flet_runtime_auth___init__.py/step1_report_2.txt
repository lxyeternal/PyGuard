  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; only module imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; purely import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a specific package namespace. There are no functions, data processing, or executable logic present. As such, it does not perform any actions that could be malicious, nor does it contain anomalies or suspicious behavior. The imports suggest use of standard authentication-related classes, but without any usage context, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, serving only to import authentication modules. No malicious behavior, anomalies, or security issues are present based on the provided code.",
