  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze their assessments, scores, and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports analyze only import statements from the `flet_runtime.auth` package.\n- No executable code, data processing, network activity, or data sinks are present.\n- The reports consistently conclude that these are benign, standard import statements with no malicious intent.\n- Malware scores are uniformly 0, and obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the code provided.\n- Security risk scores are very low or zero, which is appropriate given the limited scope.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Import statements for auth classes; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no issues found.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; benign import statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar benign import statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Slightly more cautious, mentions potential misuse if classes are used improperly but notes no actual data flow or sinks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** The securityRisk is set at 0.1, implying a very minimal concern. Given only import statements, this is reasonable; the risk could be slightly elevated if these classes are used insecurely later, but in isolation, the risk is negligible.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Since no actual usage is shown, a risk score of 0.1 seems acceptable, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, benign import statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Evaluation and Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior in mere import statements.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slight variation in report 4 (0.1) is acceptable; given only import statements, the risk should remain very low, ideally 0, unless there's context of misuse.\n\n**Overall, the reports are consistent and accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 — import statements alone do not pose a security risk.\n\n**However,** if these classes are used later in the application, their implementation could introduce vulnerabilities, but based solely on these import statements, the risk remains negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and justified. No changes needed unless further code context is provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Value | Justification                                               |\n|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                   | No malicious code present in import statements.             |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                   | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.                     |\n| Security Risk    | 0                   | Only import statements, no active code or data flow.        |\n\n---\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis of actual usage or code execution context is required.",
