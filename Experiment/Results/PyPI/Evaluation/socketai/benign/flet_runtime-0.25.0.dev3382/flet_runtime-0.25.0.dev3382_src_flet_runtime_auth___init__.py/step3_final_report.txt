  "purpose": "Import statements for authentication-related classes from the flet_runtime.auth package, likely setting up authentication and authorization functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading class definitions from the flet_runtime.auth package.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows present; only static imports.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; import statements do not involve data transfer or execution beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for classes related to authorization, groups, OAuth providers, tokens, and users. There is no executable logic, network activity, or data processing. The imports are standard for setting up authentication modules. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk mostly 0 with one at 0.1) are appropriate given the limited scope. The minimal security risk score in one report reflects a cautious stance but remains negligible in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements for authentication modules. There is no malicious activity or security concern based solely on this snippet. The scores and assessments are consistent and appropriate.",
