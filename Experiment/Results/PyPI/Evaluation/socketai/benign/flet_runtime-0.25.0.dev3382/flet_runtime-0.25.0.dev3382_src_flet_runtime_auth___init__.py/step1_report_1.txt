  "purpose": "Importing authentication and authorization-related classes from the 'flet_runtime' library, likely for handling user auth, groups, OAuth, and tokens.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'flet_runtime.auth' submodules",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs in these imports; no untrusted data handling evident",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; only import statements are present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code present in these import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for various classes related to authentication and authorization. There are no function calls, data processing, or network interactions. Since these are imports, they are not inherently malicious. The classes imported seem standard for an auth system, and no suspicious behavior is evident in the import statements alone.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward import of classes related to authentication and authorization, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
