  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code implements standard OAuth 2.0 flows for ServiceNow, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It notes proper token management and no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The code uses well-known libraries (`requests`, `requests_oauthlib`, `oauthlib`) and standard OAuth flows. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The token handling appears correct, and no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Verdict:** The assessment seems accurate. The low security risk score (0.1) aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities. The malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it confirms standard OAuth2 flows, secure handling of credentials, and no suspicious behavior. It notes the use of standard libraries and proper token refresh logic.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The code again follows typical OAuth practices. The minor concern about the use of `assert` for response validation is noted but is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n\n- **Verdict:** The scores are appropriate. The security risk remains low, and no malware or obfuscation issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code handles OAuth2 flows securely, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious intent. It mentions the use of `assert` as a minor concern but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The use of `assert` for response validation could be considered a minor flaw (since `assert` statements can be disabled in production, potentially skipping validation). However, this does not introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Verdict:** The scores are consistent with the analysis. No malware or obfuscation issues are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs standard OAuth2 flows with proper token management, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's structure and behavior are typical for OAuth2 clients. No obfuscation or malicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Verdict:** The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, it confirms legitimate OAuth2 flows, proper handling of credentials, and no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n- **Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior—no malicious activity or backdoors are evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2). Given the code's handling of sensitive data via parameters and secure HTTP requests, these are reasonable. The minor concern about `assert` statements is acknowledged but does not significantly elevate risk.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The reports' assessments are consistent and justified based on the code provided.\n\n- The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate.\n\n- The security risk scores could be slightly increased if one considers the use of `assert` for response validation as a potential point of failure, but it does not constitute a security vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (minor concerns about response validation, but overall low risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code appears secure, legitimate, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements.",
