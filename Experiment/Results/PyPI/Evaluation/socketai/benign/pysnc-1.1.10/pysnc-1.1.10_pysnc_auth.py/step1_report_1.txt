{
  "purpose": "The code implements OAuth 2.0 authentication flows for ServiceNow API integration, supporting JWT and password grant types.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as username, password, client_id, client_secret, and JWT; fetches tokens via HTTP POST request.",
  "sinks": "Requests to token endpoint, setting Authorization headers with Bearer tokens.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (username, password, JWT) are used to obtain access tokens through HTTP requests, which are then used in API requests.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Usage of standard libraries and OAuth flows appears legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code follows typical OAuth 2.0 patterns for ServiceNow API authentication. It securely handles tokens, refreshes them when expired, and uses standard requests library functions. No obfuscated code, malicious API calls, or hidden behaviors are present. The JWT-based flow correctly obtains access tokens from the token endpoint. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of OAuth 2.0 authentication for ServiceNow, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It properly manages tokens and uses secure HTTP requests without hardcoded secrets or malicious code.",
