  "purpose": "This code provides OAuth2 authentication flows for ServiceNow using password and JWT grant types.",
  "sources": "Reads username, password, client_id, client_secret, and JWT token from parameters and request URL.",
  "sinks": "Requests to token URL for OAuth tokens, request headers for authorization, and potentially sensitive data in parameters.",
  "flows": "Input data (credentials, JWT) is used to obtain access tokens via HTTP POST; tokens are then used in request headers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no unusual or suspicious code behavior; proper token handling. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard OAuth2 flows with clear methods for password and JWT-based authentication. It does not include malicious behaviors such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The usage of request.post and headers appears legitimate. The token handling logic is typical and safe. No anomalies in code structure or logic. The imports are standard, and dependencies are explicit. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. Overall, the code appears to be standard, legitimate authentication code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of OAuth2 authentication flows for ServiceNow, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It handles sensitive data carefully and does not exhibit suspicious behavior. It appears safe and intended for legitimate authentication purposes.",
