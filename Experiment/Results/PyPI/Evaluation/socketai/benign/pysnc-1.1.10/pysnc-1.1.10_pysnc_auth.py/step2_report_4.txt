  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes OAuth flows, including JWT and password grant.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; tokens are fetched and used properly.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; standard libraries, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code; no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are reasonable. The low security risk reflects the code's standard, secure OAuth implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies OAuth2 flows, including credentials and JWT.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; tokens are fetched and injected into requests.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; standard libraries; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Proper OAuth implementation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable. Slightly higher risk score accounts for handling of sensitive data, but no issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes OAuth2 flows, with token exchange.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Proper; tokens used in headers.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `assert` for response validation is noted—this could be problematic if assertions are disabled in production, potentially leading to unhandled errors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent; standard OAuth2 practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Justification for risk score:** The use of `assert` is a minor concern but not malicious. It could lead to unhandled errors if assertions are disabled, which is a potential security or stability concern, but not an attack vector.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; standard OAuth2 flow.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Proper token management.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate OAuth2 implementation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; standard OAuth2 flows.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Proper token exchange and header injection.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the clean, straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2) are justified given the handling of sensitive data, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The only minor point is the use of `assert` in Report 3. While not malicious, replacing `assert` with explicit error handling would improve robustness and security. However, this does not warrant a higher malware score.\n\n### Final estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (current scores are reasonable)\n\n---\n\n**Summary conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent with the code, which appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of OAuth2 authentication flows for ServiceNow. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are evident. The minor concern about `assert` usage in one report could be addressed, but it does not impact the overall security assessment.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain current scores; no changes necessary.",
