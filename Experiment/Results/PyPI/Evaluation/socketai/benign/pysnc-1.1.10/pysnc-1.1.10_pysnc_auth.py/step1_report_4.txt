{
  "purpose": "This code provides OAuth2 authentication flows for ServiceNow, including password grant and JWT-based authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, request URL, and JWT tokens; obtains tokens via HTTP POST requests.",
  "sinks": "Uses requests.post to exchange JWT for access tokens, modifies request headers to include Authorization tokens.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., JWT, credentials) are used to fetch access tokens via external HTTP requests; tokens are stored and used in subsequent request headers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no unusual dynamic code execution; proper handling of token expiration. No backdoors or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard OAuth2 flows for ServiceNow, utilizing external requests to obtain access tokens. It securely manages tokens and updates request headers accordingly. No suspicious obfuscation or malicious intent is apparent. The use of requests for token exchange and header manipulation is typical for OAuth2 implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of OAuth2 authentication flows for ServiceNow, with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It adheres to best practices for token management and external HTTP requests.",
