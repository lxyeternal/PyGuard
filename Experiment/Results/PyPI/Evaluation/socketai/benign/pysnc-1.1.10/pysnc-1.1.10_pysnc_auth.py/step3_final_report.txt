  "purpose": "Implementation of OAuth 2.0 flows for ServiceNow, supporting JWT and password grant types, using standard libraries and request handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters (username, password, client_id, client_secret, jwt), HTTP request responses from token endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Authorization headers in requests, token storage and refresh logic, response handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters used to request tokens via POST, tokens stored in object state, headers updated with Bearer tokens for subsequent requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert' for response validation, which can be disabled in production, potentially leading to unhandled errors. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard OAuth 2.0 flows for ServiceNow, with proper token management and no suspicious network activity. The use of 'assert' for response validation is a minor concern but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The overall structure and behavior are consistent with legitimate OAuth client code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of OAuth 2.0 authentication flows for ServiceNow. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor concern about 'assert' can be addressed for robustness but does not impact security assessment. Scores are appropriately low for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk.",
