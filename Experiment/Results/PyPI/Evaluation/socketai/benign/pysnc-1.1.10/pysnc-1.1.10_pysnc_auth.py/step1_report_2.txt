{
  "purpose": "The code provides OAuth2 authentication flows for ServiceNow API integration, including password grant and JWT-based authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads user credentials (username, password, client ID, client secret, JWT) from parameters and fetches tokens via HTTP POST requests.",
  "sinks": "Sends tokens and credentials over HTTPS; stores access tokens; modifies request headers for authorization.",
  "flows": "Inputs credentials and JWT, performs token requests to token endpoint, stores access tokens, and injects 'Authorization' header into requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; uses standard libraries; no obfuscated code or unusual patterns. The JWT token is used directly without validation here, but that is typical in OAuth flows. No hidden backdoors or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements OAuth authentication flows with proper token retrieval and refresh logic. It reads sensitive credentials but only as input parameters, not hardcoded. The token request is made via HTTPS POST with appropriate headers. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are present. The code does not contain any malicious functions or data leaks. It adheres to standard OAuth practices without obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement standard OAuth2 authentication flows for ServiceNow integration, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles credentials securely in memory and makes proper HTTP requests for tokens. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.",
