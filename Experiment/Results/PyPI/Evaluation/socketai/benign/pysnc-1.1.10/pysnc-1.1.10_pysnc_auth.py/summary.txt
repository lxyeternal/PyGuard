  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of OAuth 2.0 authentication flows for ServiceNow. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor concern about 'assert' can be addressed for robustness but does not impact security assessment. Scores are appropriately low for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk."
