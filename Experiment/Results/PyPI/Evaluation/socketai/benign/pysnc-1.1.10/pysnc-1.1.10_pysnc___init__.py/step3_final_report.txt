  "purpose": "Module initialization or import script for package setup.",
  "sources": "Local module files (.client, .record, .auth, __version__); commented-out import of exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Import statements establish namespace; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*), commented-out import line, but these are common in __init__.py files and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for internal modules and version info. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. Wildcard imports can cause namespace pollution but are typical in package init files. The commented import is benign. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The overall structure indicates a standard package setup with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a straightforward package initializer. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The minor concern about wildcard imports does not constitute a security risk. The current malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1, reflecting a minor namespace pollution concern that is acceptable in this context.",
