  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward __init__.py or module import script.\n- No dynamic code, user input, external data fetching, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- Commented-out import of an exceptions module is noted but not suspicious.\n- Wildcard imports are used, which can be a minor namespace pollution concern but not malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1.0), which aligns with the assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify actual issues in the code. The code is simple and standard for package initialization.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors or flaws are apparent. The only minor concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can lead to namespace pollution but is common in package __init__.py files.\n\n### Scoring Analysis\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity is observed.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1 due to the wildcard import concern, which is reasonable.\n\n### Justification of Scores\n- **Risk score (>0.5):** None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly set to 0.\n- **Security risk:** The minor concern about wildcard imports justifies a low score (~0.1), which is consistent.\n\n### Critical Evaluation\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the risk. They correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The commented-out import line is not suspicious; it’s typical during development.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis remains factual.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations\n**Based on all reports and the code:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security concern)\n\n**Additional note:** Wildcard imports are generally discouraged because they can pollute the namespace, but this is a common pattern in package __init__.py files and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0            | No malicious activity observed.                                               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.                            |\n| Security Risk    | 0            | No security issues; minor namespace pollution concern, but not a risk.     |\n\nThis code appears entirely benign and standard for a Python package's initialization script.",
