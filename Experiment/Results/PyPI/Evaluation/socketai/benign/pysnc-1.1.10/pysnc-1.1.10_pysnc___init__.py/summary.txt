  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a straightforward package initializer. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The minor concern about wildcard imports does not constitute a security risk. The current malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1, reflecting a minor namespace pollution concern that is acceptable in this context."
