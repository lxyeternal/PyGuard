  "purpose": "This code imports modules and version information for a Python package, likely to set up the package's namespace.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules: client, record, auth, and __version__",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Importing modules and version info; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Commented out import of exceptions; no suspicious or unusual code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard import operations from local modules and a version file. No external inputs, data handling, or dynamic code execution are present. The commented line suggests some module was temporarily excluded, but nothing malicious is indicated. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module import section typical of a Python package. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
