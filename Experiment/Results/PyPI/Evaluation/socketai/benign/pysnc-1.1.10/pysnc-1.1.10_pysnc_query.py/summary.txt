  "conclusion": "The code is a standard query builder with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware detected. The primary security consideration is ensuring input sanitization outside this module to prevent injection vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2–0.4 depending on context, with a conservative estimate of 0.4 to account for potential injection if inputs are maliciously crafted."
