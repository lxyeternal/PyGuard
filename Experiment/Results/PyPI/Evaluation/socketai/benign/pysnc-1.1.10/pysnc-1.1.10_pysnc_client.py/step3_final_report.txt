  "purpose": "A Python client for interacting with ServiceNow APIs, including record, attachment, and batch request management.",
  "sources": "Parameters for requests, internal request and response objects, serialized GlideRecord data, batch request bodies.",
  "sinks": "Network requests via requests.Session.send, batch request execution, response handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and serialized data flow into request objects, which are prepared and sent over the network; responses are validated and processed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, standard base64 encoding in batch requests, no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured API client for ServiceNow, utilizing standard request construction, session management, retries, and response validation. Batch requests encode bodies in base64, which is typical for handling binary data. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The use of requests.Session and proper error handling suggests legitimate intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential network exposure, but no malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented ServiceNow API client with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The low risk score reflects minimal concern, primarily due to network interactions, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present.",
