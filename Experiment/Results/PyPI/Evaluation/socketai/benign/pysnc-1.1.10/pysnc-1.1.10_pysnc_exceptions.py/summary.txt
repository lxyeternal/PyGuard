  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The only concern is a coding mistake in the RestException constructor that could cause runtime errors but does not pose security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1 due to the unconventional super() call."
