  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error conditions in an application.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines exception classes and their initializers.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "None; the code only establishes class inheritance and exception structures.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code within RestException's __init__ method suggests previous handling of error messages, but no suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for exception handling, including inheritance from built-in exceptions. There are no external inputs, data reads, or data manipulations. The only notable aspect is the commented-out block in RestException, which does not execute and does not affect runtime behavior. There are no indications of malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions for error handling in a Python application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. No anomalous or suspicious behavior is detected.",
