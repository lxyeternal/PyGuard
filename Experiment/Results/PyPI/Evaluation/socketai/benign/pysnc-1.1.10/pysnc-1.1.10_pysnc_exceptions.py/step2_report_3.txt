  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** The report correctly identifies that the code defines custom exception classes with no data input/output.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The only noted anomaly is the commented-out code in `RestException.__init__`, which is benign. No malicious behavior, secrets, or suspicious logic are present.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The conclusion states no malicious intent, which aligns with the code. The malware score is 0, security risk is 0, and confidence is 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate assessment. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Correctly notes that only exception classes are defined, with no external data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Same as above, only the commented-out code is present, which is harmless.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Appropriately assigned malware and security risk scores as 0. Confidence is 1.\n- **Verdict:** Sound analysis; no adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Correctly states no data input/output; only class definitions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The only noteworthy point is the unconventional `super()` call in `RestException.__init__`, which might be a coding mistake but not malicious.\n- **Scores & Justification:** The report assigns a security risk of 0.1, possibly due to the unconventional `super()` call, but this is more of a coding flaw than a security risk. The malware score remains 0.\n- **Justification for Risk Score > 0:** Since the code does not execute malicious actions, the risk score of 0.1 seems slightly high; perhaps 0.0 is more appropriate unless there's further context.\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable, but the risk score could be lowered to 0, as there's no actual security threat.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Correctly notes the class definitions, with no data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The commented-out code in `RestException.__init__` is benign.\n- **Scores & Justification:** The malware score is 0, security risk is 0, matching the benign nature.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as above, correctly identifies the structure and benign nature, with no malicious activity.\n- Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely class definitions for exception handling.\n- The only minor anomaly is the commented-out code in `RestException.__init__`, which is harmless.\n- The malware scores are correctly assigned as 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1, which seems slightly overstated given the benign nature.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior present)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, standard class definitions)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk; minor coding flaw in one report but not a security concern)\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The only point to note is the unconventional `super()` call, which is a coding mistake rather than a security issue.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No security concerns are evident. The code is safe, and the scores should reflect that with all zeros.",
