  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error handling scenarios in a Python application.",
  "sources": "None (no data input or external data reads; class definitions only).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output, network communication, or external system interaction).",
  "flows": "Not applicable (no data flow from sources to sinks).",
  "anomalies": "The RestException class contains commented-out code that suggests it might process messages and extract error details, but as it stands, it only formats a string with status code and message. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, primarily for application error handling. The RestException class has a commented-out block that hints at potential processing of message dictionaries, but currently it only formats the message string. No dynamic code execution, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are evident. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The structure is typical for an error handling module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for defining custom exceptions in Python and shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
