  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources or data reading mechanisms present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points handling untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The __init__ method in RestException calls super with self as the first argument, which is unconventional and might cause recursion issues but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with some inheritance from built-in Exception classes. The only notable point is the commented-out code in RestException's __init__, which is benign. No input handling, data processing, or external communication is present. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The unconventional call to super() in RestException's __init__ could be a coding error but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are present.",
