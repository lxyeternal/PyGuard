  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the provided scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Define custom exception classes; no data flow or external data.\n- Anomalies: Commented-out code in RestException suggests potential message processing but currently inactive.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, secrets, or suspicious logic.\n- Conclusion: Standard exception definitions, safe.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \nThese are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, defining custom exceptions.\n- Anomalies: Commented-out code in RestException's __init__, but no suspicious activity.\n- Analysis: No external data, no malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard code.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \nAppropriate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same purpose.\n- Anomalies: The __init__ method in RestException calls super with self as the first argument, which is unconventional and could cause recursion issues, but not malicious.\n- Analysis: No malicious code, just a potential bug.\n- Conclusion: No malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \nGiven the unconventional super() call, a slightly increased securityRisk score (0.1) is justified, but malware remains zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same.\n- Anomalies: Commented-out code in RestException.__init__, no suspicious activity.\n- Analysis: Standard exception classes, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \nAppropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same.\n- Anomalies: Commented-out code, no suspicious behavior.\n- Analysis: No external data, no malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \nAppropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent.\n- The only minor concern is the unconventional super() call in Report 3, which could cause runtime issues but is not malicious.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Remains at 0 across all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** For Report 3, a slight increase to 0.1 is justified due to the unconventional super() call, which could lead to runtime bugs but not security risks.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the potential bug in Report 3's constructor)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard exception handling classes with no malicious or obfuscated code. The only notable point is the super() call in Report 3, which warrants a minimal risk score adjustment but does not indicate security issues.",
