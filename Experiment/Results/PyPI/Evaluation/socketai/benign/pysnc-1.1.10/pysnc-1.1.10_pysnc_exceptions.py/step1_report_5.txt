{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for various error conditions in a Python application.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reading mechanisms are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output mechanisms, such as network or file I/O, are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow between sources and sinks; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable code is the commented-out block inside RestException.__init__, which appears to be an attempt at handling message structures, but it's inactive. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, some of which extend existing exception classes. The RestException class has a constructor with a commented-out block that hints at handling structured error messages but is currently inactive. No external data reading, data processing, or network activity occurs. The classes are straightforward, and there's no indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of custom exception class definitions intended for error handling within an application. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The only noteworthy aspect is the commented-out error handling logic, which appears benign.",
