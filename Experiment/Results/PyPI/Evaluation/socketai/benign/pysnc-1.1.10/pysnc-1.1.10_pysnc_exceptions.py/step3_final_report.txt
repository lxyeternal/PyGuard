{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for various error conditions in an application, serving as a structured error handling mechanism.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code solely defines classes and a constructor with commented-out code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "Class definitions do not involve data flow; the only flow is within the constructor of RestException, which is straightforward but contains a commented-out block.",
  "anomalies": "The __init__ method of RestException uses an unconventional super() call: super(RestException, self).__init__(self, \"%s - %s\" % (status_code, message)), passing 'self' as an argument, which may cause recursion or runtime errors. The code also contains commented-out blocks that suggest prior error message processing but are inactive.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple exception class definitions with no active malicious code or external data handling. The only notable anomaly is the unconventional use of super() in RestException.__init__, which could lead to runtime issues but does not introduce malicious behavior. The commented-out code is benign and does not affect security. The overall structure is straightforward and safe, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The potential bug in the constructor warrants a slight increase in security risk score but does not elevate malware or obfuscation scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The only concern is a coding mistake in the RestException constructor that could cause runtime errors but does not pose security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1 due to the unconventional super() call.",
