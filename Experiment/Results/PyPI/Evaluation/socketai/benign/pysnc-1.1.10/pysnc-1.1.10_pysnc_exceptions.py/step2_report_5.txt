  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines multiple custom exception classes, mostly inheriting from Exception or specific subclasses.\n- RestException has an __init__ method with commented-out code that hints at processing structured error messages but currently only formats a string with status code and message.\n- No external data input/output, network activity, or data processing.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- The only anomaly noted is the commented-out code in RestException.__init__, which is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**Report 1 & 2:**\n- Both conclude the code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence is high (1).\n- Malware score is 0.\n- The commented-out code in RestException is noted but deemed harmless.\n- **Score adjustments:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Notes that the __init__ method in RestException calls super with `self` as the first argument, which is unconventional and could cause recursion issues, but not malicious.\n- The comment mentions this might be a coding error, not malicious.\n- The report assigns a security risk of 0.1, which is slightly elevated but not significant.\n- **Justification:** Since the unconventional super() call could lead to runtime errors, it’s worth noting, but it does not indicate malicious activity.\n- **Score adjustment:** Keep malware at 0, security risk at 0.1 seems appropriate, no need to increase.\n\n**Report 4 & 5:**\n- Similar conclusions: code is standard, with only the commented-out block in RestException.__init__ as an anomaly.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Confidence is high.\n- **Score adjustments:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, standard exception class definitions.\n- The only \"anomaly\" is the commented-out code in RestException.__init__, which is benign and not malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to the unconventional super() call, which could cause runtime issues but not security risks)\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a minor potential for runtime errors, not security risk)\n\nThis code appears safe, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only minor concern is the unconventional super() call, which could be corrected but does not constitute a security issue.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a straightforward exception hierarchy with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
