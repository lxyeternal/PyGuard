{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a Python application, particularly related to REST API interactions and database operations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and the __init__ method in RestException",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data handling is present",
  "flows": "None; exception classes are used for control flow, not data flow",
  "anomalies": "The RestException __init__ method contains commented-out code that attempts to parse message details but currently does nothing suspicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions. The RestException class has an __init__ method with commented-out code that, if active, could parse nested error details, but currently, it only formats and sets exception messages. There are no data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious activities. The structure is typical for error handling in Python applications. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are evident. The commented-out code does not impact functionality, nor does it pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for application error handling.",
