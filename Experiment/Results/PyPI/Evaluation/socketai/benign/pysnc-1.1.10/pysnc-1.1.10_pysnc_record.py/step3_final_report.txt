{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and methods for interacting with ServiceNow's API, managing records and elements, and serializing data for API communication.",
  "sources": "Data is read from API responses, user inputs, and method parameters such as query conditions, fields, and record data.",
  "sinks": "Network requests via requests library (API calls), data serialization for transmission, URL generation for record links.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through method calls into API request functions, with responses processed into GlideElement and GlideRecord objects, then serialized for output or further requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or backdoors detected. Uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive SDK for ServiceNow interaction, including record and element management, querying, serialization, and network communication. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or sabotage patterns are present. The network interactions are typical for such SDKs, and data handling follows standard practices. The code structure is clear, with no signs of hidden or malicious code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified based on the code's functionality and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK for ServiceNow API interactions, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The security risk and malware scores are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
