  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and determine the actual security posture based on the provided code and the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SDK for ServiceNow, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (Very low, just general low risk)  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The report's conclusion aligns with the code review: no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- The logic is sound; no hidden behaviors are detected.  \n- **Recommendation:** Keep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0. The overall risk remains very low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API interaction, no malicious code, and no obfuscation.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (Still low, slight increase possibly due to broader scope)  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Consistent with the first report, no malicious or suspicious patterns.  \n- The code appears legitimate, primarily handling data and API requests.  \n- **Recommendation:** Malware and obfuscated scores stay at 0; overall risk remains minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a typical ServiceNow client SDK, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (Same as previous, still low)  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The analysis aligns with the code's structure; no signs of malicious activity.  \n- External interactions are standard API calls.  \n- **Recommendation:** Keep malware and obfuscated at 0; risk remains very low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client for ServiceNow, with no malicious payloads or obfuscation.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The review confirms no malicious or suspicious behaviors.  \n- All network interactions are standard for such SDKs.  \n- **Recommendation:** Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0; overall risk minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate client library, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Consistent with previous reports, no signs of malicious intent.  \n- No obfuscation or hidden behaviors detected.  \n- **Recommendation:** Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0; risk remains very low.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Final Estimations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any report.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied but generally very low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting standard SDK behavior without vulnerabilities.\n\n**Given the comprehensive review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code or payloads)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard API client code)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               |\n| Risk             | 0.1             |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a well-structured, legitimate SDK component for ServiceNow, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk score reflects its standard, expected behavior in API interaction and data handling.",
