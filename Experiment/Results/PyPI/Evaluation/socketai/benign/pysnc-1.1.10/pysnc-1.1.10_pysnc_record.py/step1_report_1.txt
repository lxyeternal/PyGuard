{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and methods for interacting with ServiceNow records via REST API, including data serialization, querying, and record manipulation.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user input, API responses, and internal method calls (e.g., in query and record retrieval functions).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests (requests library), file attachment uploads, and data serialization functions, which could leak data or execute malicious code if inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (user/API data) through validation and processing in class methods, with network requests and data serialization acting as sinks; no explicit dangerous flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. The code uses standard Python features and libraries without obfuscation. No unusual behaviors or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements typical API interaction patterns with data serialization, querying, and record management in a ServiceNow context. All external interactions are via well-known libraries (requests), and data handling appears standard. No signs of malicious payloads, code injection, or privacy violations are present. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or unauthorized access are detected. The structure and formatting are consistent with standard SDKs, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK component for ServiceNow interactions, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The risk level is very low, with no malicious intent detected.",
