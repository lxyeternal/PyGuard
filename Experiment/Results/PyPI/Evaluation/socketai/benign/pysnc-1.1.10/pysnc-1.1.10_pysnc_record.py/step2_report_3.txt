  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their conclusions, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SDK for ServiceNow, with no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is a typical SDK, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The low malware and risk scores are justified. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it notes the code as a standard ServiceNow SDK with no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis is consistent with the code's structure. No suspicious behaviors or malicious intent are apparent. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages ServiceNow records, with network interactions via requests, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. No signs of malware or sabotage are evident. The risk score reflects standard API client behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles ServiceNow records, with network calls and data serialization, all standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical client library for ServiceNow, with no signs of malware or sabotage.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe conclusion is appropriate; no malicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:**  \n  All reports agree that the code is a standard SDK for ServiceNow, with no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or sabotage detected. The code uses common libraries, handles data serialization, querying, and record management, which are typical for such SDKs.\n\n- **Scores Justification:**  \n  All malware scores are zero, which is justified given the absence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The risk scores are low, reflecting the typical security posture of a client SDK interacting with external APIs.\n\n- **Potential Concerns:**  \n  No evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK component.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (Confirmed, no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (No obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (Appropriate, given the code's purpose and structure)\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard SDK behavior)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code shows no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The low scores are justified, and there are no anomalies or suspicious patterns requiring further investigation.",
