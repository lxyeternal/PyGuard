  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign attachment management module with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior. Minor security considerations exist but do not elevate the overall risk. The code appears safe for use in production environments, with room for slight improvements in input validation and error handling."
