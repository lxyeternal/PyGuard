  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data output or external communication",
  "flows": "The code reads the package version from the package metadata and stores it in a variable",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple metadata access with no suspicious or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'importlib.metadata' module to access package metadata. It defines the package name '__title__' as 'pysnc' and retrieves its version. The operation is straightforward and standard for obtaining package info, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or data leaks. No external data is sent, and no secrets or credentials are hardcoded. The code performs a common task with minimal complexity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign script to get the version of a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
