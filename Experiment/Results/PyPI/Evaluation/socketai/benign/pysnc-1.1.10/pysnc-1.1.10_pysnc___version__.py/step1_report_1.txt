  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward metadata retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata to dynamically fetch the version of the 'pysnc' package and assigns it to __version__. This is a standard operation for package version management. No user input, external data, or network communication occurs. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign retrieval of package metadata with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
