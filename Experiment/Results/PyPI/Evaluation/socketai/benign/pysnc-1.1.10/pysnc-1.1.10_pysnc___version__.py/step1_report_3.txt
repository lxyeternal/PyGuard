  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'pysnc' package.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version(__title__)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external output that could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "The code assigns a string to __title__, then uses it to get the package version from importlib.metadata, which is a safe internal operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward use of standard library to retrieve package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata to access package metadata. It sets __title__ to 'pysnc' and retrieves its version. The code is minimal, standard, and does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign retrieval of package metadata with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
