  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review and Security Implications:**\n\n   - The `get_instance()` function processes an input string representing an instance URL or name:\n     - If the input contains '://', it treats it as a URL:\n       - It strips trailing slashes.\n       - It raises an exception if the URL starts with 'http://' instead of 'https://'.\n       - Otherwise, it returns the URL as-is.\n     - If the input does not contain '.', it constructs a default URL with 'https://<instance>.service-now.com'.\n     - If none of these conditions are met, it raises an exception about the instance name being malformed.\n   \n   - The `MockHeaders` class is a simple wrapper around headers, providing methods to retrieve headers by name.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n\n   - **Security Concern:** The code enforces HTTPS URLs, which is good. However:\n     - It does not validate whether the provided URL is well-formed beyond checking for '://'.\n     - It does not verify if the URL is reachable or if it points to a trusted domain.\n     - It allows URLs with 'https://' but does not validate their correctness or security beyond that.\n   - **Potential for Injection or Malformed Inputs:**\n     - The function constructs URLs using string formatting without sanitization, which could be problematic if the input is maliciously crafted.\n   - **Error Handling:**\n     - The exception messages are straightforward but do not specify the nature of the malformed URL beyond the initial check.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports:**\n\n   - All reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.\n   - The reports do not provide details about the nature of the incident, payloads, or malicious activity.\n   - The lack of detailed response data makes it impossible to identify actual malicious behavior or vulnerabilities from these reports.\n\n4. **Assessment of the Reports in Context of the Code:**\n\n   - Since all reports show empty responses, **there's no evidence from these reports that the code is being exploited or that malicious payloads are involved**.\n   - The reports do not mention any malformed URLs, injection attempts, or malicious responses.\n   - The reports seem to be placeholders or indicate that no meaningful data was received.\n\n5. **Scores and Justification:**\n\n   - **Malware Score:** Given the lack of evidence of malicious activity, the malware score should be **0**.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** The code does not appear obfuscated; the logic is straightforward. Score should be **0**.\n   - **Risk Score:** Since there are no indications of active vulnerabilities or exploits, the overall risk score should be **low**, around **0.1** or **0.2**.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n\n   - The code's main security concern is minimal but could be improved by:\n     - Validating URLs more strictly.\n     - Sanitizing inputs before constructing URLs.\n     - Implementing HTTPS certificate validation if applicable.\n   - The reports do not provide enough data to suggest that these improvements are urgently needed based on current evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Code issues:** No critical issues identified from the provided code snippet.\n- **Report validity:** No evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities in the reports.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: **0**\n  - Obfuscated: **0**\n  - Risk: **0.2** (to reflect minimal risk due to lack of validation)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Without additional context or detailed response data, these reports do not indicate a security incident. The code is relatively simple and does not exhibit obvious flaws that would warrant higher scores.",
