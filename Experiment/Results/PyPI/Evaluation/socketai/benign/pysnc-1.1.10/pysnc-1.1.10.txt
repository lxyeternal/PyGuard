      "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The only concern is a coding mistake in the RestException constructor that could cause runtime errors but does not pose security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1 due to the unconventional super() call."

The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior. Minor security considerations exist but do not elevate the overall risk. The code appears safe for use in production environments, with room for slight improvements in input validation and error handling."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a straightforward package initializer. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The minor concern about wildcard imports does not constitute a security risk. The current malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1, reflecting a minor namespace pollution concern that is acceptable in this context."

The reports of 'Empty response' do not relate to this code, indicating external issues or test failures. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores should be zero. The overall assessment is that the code is safe and well-structured, with only minor robustness improvements recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of OAuth 2.0 authentication flows for ServiceNow. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor concern about 'assert' can be addressed for robustness but does not impact security assessment. Scores are appropriately low for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard query builder with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware detected. The primary security consideration is ensuring input sanitization outside this module to prevent injection vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2–0.4 depending on context, with a conservative estimate of 0.4 to account for potential injection if inputs are maliciously crafted."
