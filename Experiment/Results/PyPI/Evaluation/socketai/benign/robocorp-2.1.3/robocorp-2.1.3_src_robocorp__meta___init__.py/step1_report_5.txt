  "purpose": "Assign version string and parse it into a list of integers for version comparison.",
  "sources": "Read the string '__version__' and split it into parts.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "Parsing '__version__' into a list of integers; no flow to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version assignment and parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to '__version__' and then splits it into a list of integers called 'version_info'. There is no use of external input, no data flow to sinks, and no suspicious or unusual code behavior. The operations are typical for version handling and do not indicate malicious intent or malicious code structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard version string handling with no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not pose security risks or contain malware.",
