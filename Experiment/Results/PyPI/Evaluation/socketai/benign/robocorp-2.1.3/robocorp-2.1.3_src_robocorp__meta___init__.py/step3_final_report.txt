  "purpose": "Parse the package version string into a list of integers for easy comparison or processing.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ string; splitting __version__ to generate version_info list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "Version string assignment -> split -> convert each segment to int -> store in version_info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version parsing code with no obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string and parses it into a list of integers. It involves no external input, network activity, or code execution. The logic is simple and standard for version handling. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious actions are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple reviews, and the scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version parsing snippet with no malicious intent or security issues. The current scores and assessments are accurate and justified.",
