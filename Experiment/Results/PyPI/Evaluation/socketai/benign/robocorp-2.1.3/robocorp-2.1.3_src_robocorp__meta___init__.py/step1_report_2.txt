  "purpose": "Define the package version and parse it into a list of integers for further use.",
  "sources": "The __version__ string, split by periods.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is transmitted or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "The version string is split into components, then converted to integers.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, then splits this string at periods and converts each component into an integer to create version_info. The code is straightforward, typical for version management, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. It does not include any input/output operations, network activity, or cryptic code. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version parsing snippet with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
