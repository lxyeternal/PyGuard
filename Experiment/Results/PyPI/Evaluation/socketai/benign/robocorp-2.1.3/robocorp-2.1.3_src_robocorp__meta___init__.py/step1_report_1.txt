  "purpose": "Define the version of the package and parse it into a list of integers.",
  "sources": "__version__ string variable",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "Parsing __version__ into version_info list",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version parsing",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to __version__, then splits the string by '.' and converts each segment into an integer to form version_info. There are no external data sources, no untrusted input handling, no network activity, or code execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code is minimal and typical for version handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, just handling version information with standard string operations. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
