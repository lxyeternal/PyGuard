  "purpose": "Define the package version and parse it into a list of integers for version comparison or validation.",
  "sources": "The string '__version__' containing the version number.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is being transmitted, stored insecurely, or used in unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "The code splits '__version__' and converts each segment into an integer, which is a straightforward data transformation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a standard version parsing operation.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, then creates a list 'version_info' by splitting the string and converting each component to an integer. This is a common pattern for handling version data in Python packages. No user input, network operations, or other data flows are present that could indicate malicious activity. The code is simple and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to parse and store version information. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
