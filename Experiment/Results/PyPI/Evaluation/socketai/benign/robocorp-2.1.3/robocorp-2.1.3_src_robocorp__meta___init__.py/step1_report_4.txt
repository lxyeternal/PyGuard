  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package and converts it into a list of integers for easy comparison or processing.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string assigned to __version__.",
  "sinks": "Converts the version string into a list of integers; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Reads __version__, splits it, and converts parts into integers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and typical for version handling.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and then processes it by splitting on periods and converting each segment to an integer. No external inputs, no data leaks, no suspicious behavior. The code is standard for managing version info.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for version management and contains no malicious behavior. It is a normal, benign pattern used in Python packages.",
