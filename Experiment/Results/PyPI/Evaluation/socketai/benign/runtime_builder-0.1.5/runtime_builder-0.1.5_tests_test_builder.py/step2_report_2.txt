  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Commonalities across reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a testing harness for Python package installation scripts.\n- The code copies templates, sets environment variables, and executes shell scripts within temporary directories.\n- The primary security concern highlighted is the use of `subprocess.run()` with `shell=True`.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity are detected.\n- The code appears to be controlled and intended for testing purposes.\n\n**Critical points:**\n- The main potential vulnerability is the use of `shell=True` in subprocess calls, which can be risky if the inputs (`script_name`, `src_name`) are influenced by untrusted sources. However, in the provided code, these inputs are internal, controlled, and hardcoded in the test functions.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or supply chain compromise.\n- The environment variable file and directory copying are standard practices and do not introduce security issues in this context.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n\n1. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Given the code's nature, this is appropriate.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Score:**\n   - All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is accurate; no obfuscation is present.\n\n3. **Risk Score:**\n   - All reports give a low risk score (~0.2), citing the use of `shell=True` as a minor concern.\n   - This seems reasonable, considering the controlled environment and fixed inputs.\n\n**Justification for risk score:**\n- The only noteworthy concern is the use of `shell=True`. If inputs were untrusted, this could lead to command injection. But since the inputs are hardcoded and controlled, the risk remains minimal.\n- The overall assessment aligns with a low-risk testing script.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n- No significant discrepancies are evident. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard testing harness with no malicious behavior.\n- The use of `shell=True` warrants caution but is acceptable here.\n- No obfuscation or malware present.\n- Overall risk is low.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0.2** (consistent with the reports and justified by the controlled use of subprocess)\n\nThis conservative evaluation aligns with the detailed analysis and the controlled context of the code.",
