  "conclusion": "The code is a controlled testing harness for Python package build scripts, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the use of subprocess with shell=True, which is acceptable here given the controlled inputs. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are appropriate and justified."
