{
  "purpose": "The code sets up testing environments by copying project templates, writing environment variables, and executing shell scripts for building Python packages with different configurations.",
  "sources": "Reads __file__ for current script location, input parameters for functions (dst, src_name, script_name), and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Executes shell commands via subprocess.run with shell=True, writing environment data to files.",
  "flows": "Copies templates from known directories, writes environment variable files, runs shell scripts in the temporary directories.",
  "anomalies": "Uses subprocess.run with shell=True, which can be risky if input is untrusted, but in this context inputs are hardcoded filenames and paths; no indication of malicious intent or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly performs filesystem operations (copying directories, writing environment files) and runs predefined shell scripts for testing. It relies on trusted paths and scripts. The subprocess.run calls are constructed from controlled variables, minimizing risk. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity are observed. The overall design appears to be a standard testing framework for package builds, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a testing harness for Python package builds, involving directory copying, environment setup, and script execution. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. Use of subprocess with shell=True warrants caution but appears controlled in this context.",
