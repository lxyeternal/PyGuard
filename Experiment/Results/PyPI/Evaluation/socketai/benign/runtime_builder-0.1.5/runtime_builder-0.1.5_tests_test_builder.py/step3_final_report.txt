{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a testing harness to copy project templates, set environment variables, and execute build scripts for Python packages, primarily to verify installation procedures.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters 'script_name' and 'src_name', which determine script files and source directories; it also reads environment variable files written during execution.",
  "sinks": "The code executes shell commands via subprocess.run() with shell=True, which could potentially lead to command injection if inputs are untrusted, but in this controlled context, inputs are fixed.",
  "flows": "Inputs 'script_name' and 'src_name' flow into the construction of command strings executed by subprocess, which run shell scripts within temporary directories, with environment variables set via file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity are present. The primary anomaly is the use of subprocess with shell=True, which is a known security concern if inputs are untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code copies project templates into temporary directories, writes environment variable files, and executes build scripts using subprocess.run() with shell=True. Inputs are controlled and fixed within test functions, minimizing risk. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The main concern is the use of shell=True, which could be risky if inputs were untrusted, but in this context, the inputs are known and safe. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with this analysis, reflecting a low security risk primarily due to subprocess usage. Overall, the code appears safe and standard for testing purposes, with no significant vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a controlled testing harness for Python package build scripts, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the use of subprocess with shell=True, which is acceptable here given the controlled inputs. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are appropriate and justified.",
