  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential security issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code copies project templates, writes environment variables, and executes shell scripts via subprocess with shell=True.\n- Inputs (script_name, src_name) are function parameters, but in the provided code, they are hardcoded in test functions.\n- The code does not appear to process untrusted user input directly.\n- Use of shell=True is a potential security concern if inputs are untrusted, but in this controlled testing context, it seems unlikely to be exploited.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or cryptomining.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Issues:\n\n- **Issue presence:**  \n  The core functionality is filesystem operations and subprocess calls with controlled inputs. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The only minor concern is the use of `shell=True`, which can be risky if inputs are untrusted. However, in this context, inputs are predefined and controlled.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in logic:**  \n  No logical errors are apparent. The code performs expected tasks safely within its scope.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n\n**Malware score:**  \nAll reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity is detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \nAll reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n\n**Risk score:**  \nAll reports assign 0.2, citing the use of `shell=True` as a minor concern. This is reasonable, given the controlled inputs and testing context.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- The reports correctly identify the use of `shell=True` as a potential risk but note that in this context, inputs are controlled, so the risk is minimal.\n- They do not overstate the threat; their risk scores are appropriate.\n- No report claims any malicious activity or vulnerability beyond cautious notes about subprocess usage.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I concur that:**\n\n- There is no malware.\n- The code is not obfuscated.\n- The security risk is low, with the primary concern being the use of `shell=True`, which is acceptable here.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (consistent with reports, considering the use of `shell=True`)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a standard testing harness for Python package build scripts, with no malicious intent or activity. The minor security concern regarding subprocess calls with `shell=True` is acknowledged but not critical given the controlled environment.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed; the current scores are reasonable and justified.",
