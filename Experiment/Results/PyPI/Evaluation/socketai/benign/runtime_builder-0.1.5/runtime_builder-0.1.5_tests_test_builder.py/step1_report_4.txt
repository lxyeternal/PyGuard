{
  "purpose": "The code appears to facilitate copying project templates, setting environment variables, and running shell scripts to test Python package builds, likely as part of a testing framework for Python package installation methods.",
  "sources": "Reads include '__file__' (to determine script directory), 'src_name' (input parameter), and temporary directory creation for destination paths.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'subprocess.run' with 'shell=True' to execute commands constructed from file paths, and writes environment variables to 'RUNTIME_BUILDER_ROOT.env'.",
  "flows": "Copies templates from source directories to temporary destinations, writes environment variable files, then constructs commands to execute shell scripts within those directories.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'shell=True' in subprocess calls can be risky if inputs are untrusted, but in this code, inputs are fixed filenames and paths. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code structure is typical for testing frameworks, no obfuscation or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script copies project template directories, sets environment variables via writing files, and runs shell scripts for testing package builds. It uses 'Path' for file path management and 'subprocess.run' with 'shell=True'. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The use of 'shell=True' is a potential security consideration but appears controlled since filenames are fixed and not derived from untrusted input. No obfuscated code, malware signatures, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a testing harness for building Python packages from templates and does not exhibit malicious behavior. Its security risk is minimal, primarily concerning the use of 'shell=True' which is acceptable given controlled inputs. No malware or supply chain attack indicators are present.",
