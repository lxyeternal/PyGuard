  "purpose": "This code sets up and runs shell scripts in temporary directories for testing Python package builds, including copying templates, setting environment variables, and executing shell commands.",
  "sources": "Reads __file__, Path inputs (src_name), and the contents of environment files written to disk.",
  "sinks": "Shell command execution via subprocess.run with shell=True, writing environment variable files, copying directories.",
  "flows": "Copying project templates -> Writing environment variable files -> Executing shell scripts in temporary directories.",
  "anomalies": "Uses subprocess.run with shell=True, which can be risky if untrusted input is incorporated into the command string, but in this context, command is constructed from local paths. No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected. The code performs standard file operations and subprocess execution without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script copies project templates from a known directory relative to the script location, writes environment variables to a file, and executes shell scripts with subprocess.run using shell=True. The use of shell=True is a potential security concern if command strings are constructed from untrusted input, but here the command is generated from local, controlled paths. No malicious code or data leaks are evident. The code does not contain backdoors, data exfiltration, or cryptomining activities. It performs standard testing procedures involving temporary directories and subprocess execution. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward testing setup for Python package build scripts, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor concern is the use of subprocess with shell=True, but given the controlled context, this does not pose a significant threat.",
