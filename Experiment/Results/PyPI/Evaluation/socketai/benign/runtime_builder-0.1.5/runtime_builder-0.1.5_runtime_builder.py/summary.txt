  "conclusion": "The primary security issue is the use of exec() on external configuration files, which could be exploited if those files are maliciously altered. No evidence of malware exists, but the pattern is dangerous. Scores should reflect high risk (around 0.7) due to unsafe code practices, with malware score at 0."
