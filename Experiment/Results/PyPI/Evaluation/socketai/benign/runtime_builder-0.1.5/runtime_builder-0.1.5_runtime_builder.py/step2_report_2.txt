  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Findings Across Reports:**\n\n- **Core concern:** All reports highlight the use of `exec()` on external configuration files (`load_python_config()`), which read and execute arbitrary code from package resources or files. This pattern introduces a significant security risk, especially if the configuration files are untrusted or tampered with.\n\n- **Malware indication:** None of the reports identify explicit malicious code or malware within the codebase. The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which seems appropriate given the absence of malicious payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is consistent with the code clarity.\n\n- **Security risk scores:** Ranging from 0.6 to 0.8, these are high, reflecting the dangerous pattern of executing external code via `exec()`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The primary issue is **the use of `exec()` on external configuration files**, which can execute malicious code if those files are compromised.\n- No other security flaws or vulnerabilities are explicitly identified.\n- No hardcoded secrets or network activity are present.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify the security implications of dynamic code execution.\n- No overstatement or underestimation of risks; the scores align with the identified vulnerability.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- The **malware score** remains at 0, which is justified since no malicious code is present.\n- The **security risk scores** are high (0.6–0.8), justified by the insecure pattern of executing untrusted code.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The high risk scores are justified due to the potential for malicious configuration files to execute arbitrary code.\n- The malware score should remain at 0 unless actual malicious payloads are found, which they are not.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** **0.75** (high, due to unsafe `exec()` usage on external inputs)\n\n**Overall, the main concern is the insecure pattern of executing external configuration files with `exec()`.** This is a well-known supply chain risk but not necessarily malicious in itself.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports correctly identify the core security issue: dynamic execution of external code via `exec()`. The scores are appropriate, and no additional malicious activity is evident. Proper mitigation involves validating or sandboxing configuration files, but such measures are outside the scope of the current code.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep malware score at 0, risk score at approximately 0.75, obfuscation at 0. Confirm that no actual malicious code exists before considering higher risk scores.",
