      "conclusion": "The primary security issue is the use of exec() on external configuration files, which could be exploited if those files are maliciously altered. No evidence of malware exists, but the pattern is dangerous. Scores should reflect high risk (around 0.7) due to unsafe code practices, with malware score at 0."

      "conclusion": "The code is a controlled testing harness for Python package build scripts, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the use of subprocess with shell=True, which is acceptable here given the controlled inputs. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are appropriate and justified."
