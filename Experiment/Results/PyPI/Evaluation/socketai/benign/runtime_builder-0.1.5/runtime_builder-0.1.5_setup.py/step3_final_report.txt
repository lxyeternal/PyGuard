{
  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for packaging a Python module named 'runtime_builder'.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with a static list of modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard setup script with no dynamic or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static setup script importing 'setuptools' and registering 'runtime_builder' as a module. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, external data, or suspicious patterns. The module name is generic and commonly used in build contexts. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent and appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify it as a standard, safe packaging script. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
