  "purpose": "To configure the packaging of a Python module named 'runtime_builder' for distribution.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; uses static configuration for setup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for a setup script; no unusual patterns or secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools to package a single module. It does not include any dynamic code execution, input handling, or suspicious patterns. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or backdoors are present. The code's simplicity reduces the likelihood of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is benign and serves a standard purpose of packaging a Python module. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in the provided code.",
