  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for a Python package, specifying a single module to be included.",
  "sources": "The 'from setuptools import setup' statement and the setup() function call with 'py_modules' parameter.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "The setup() call is static and does not process or execute untrusted input; no data flows from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is minimal and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from setuptools and calls it with a configuration that includes a module named 'runtime_builder'. There is no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, and no obfuscated code. The package appears to be a straightforward setup script for distributing a single module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply defines a package configuration for publishing or installation.",
