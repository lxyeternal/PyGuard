{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package using setuptools, specifying a single module named 'runtime_builder' to be included in the package.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only calls setup() with static parameters.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from source to sink; the script is purely declarative for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code appears to be standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with a static configuration, including a module named 'runtime_builder'. There are no indications of malicious code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious patterns. The module name alone does not indicate malicious intent; it is typical for setup scripts to specify modules to be included. No external inputs, environment variables, or dynamic code execution are present. Overall, this is a straightforward package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply specifies a module for package distribution, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
