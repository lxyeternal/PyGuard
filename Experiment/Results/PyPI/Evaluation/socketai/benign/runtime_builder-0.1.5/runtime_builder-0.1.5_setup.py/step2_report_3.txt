  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a standard setup script using setuptools, specifying a single module 'runtime_builder'.\n   - The code is static, with no dynamic input, external data, or code execution.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious Behavior or Anomalies**:\n   - No report indicates any obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The module name 'runtime_builder' is generic and commonly used in build or runtime contexts but does not inherently suggest malicious intent.\n   - No evidence of data flows from untrusted sources, no external inputs, and no sinks that could process untrusted data.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment; the code is minimal and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n   - Confidence is high (1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all assessments are consistent with the code's content.\n\n6. **Score Justification**:\n   - Since the code is purely a static setup script with no malicious features, the malware score should remain at 0.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - Security risk score is 0, given the lack of any suspicious or risky behavior.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. All scores are appropriate and consistent with the content.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: No adjustments are necessary; the initial assessments are accurate.",
