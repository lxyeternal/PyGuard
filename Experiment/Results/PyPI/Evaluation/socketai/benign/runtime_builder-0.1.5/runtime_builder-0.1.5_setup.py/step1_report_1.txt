{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package using setuptools, specifying a single module named 'runtime_builder' to be included in the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the setup configuration and the module name 'runtime_builder'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from the import to the setup() call, which processes the module list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The module name 'runtime_builder' is generic but not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package, indicating only one module. No code execution, input handling, or malicious patterns are detected. The module 'runtime_builder' may be used in runtime or build processes, but the code itself provides no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. The code does not contain any suspicious patterns or potential malware features.",
