  "purpose": "This code is for configuring a Python package setup, specifying a module named 'runtime_builder' for installation.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; only static configuration defining modules to be included in the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows present; setup configuration is static and does not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard package setup; no unusual or suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'setuptools' to define a package with a single module. It lacks any dynamic code execution, external input, or other suspicious behavior. There are no anomalies or malicious patterns detected. The code appears to be a typical setup script for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely specifies a module for packaging.",
