{
  "purpose": "Provides a template filter and global function for accessing environment variables within a templating system.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via os.getenv and os.environ",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data output or network actions present",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and passed directly into templates; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard environment variable access",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to retrieve environment variables with optional default values, with standard error handling. It exposes this function as a template filter and global variable, allowing templates to access environment variables securely. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code relies on standard library functions for environment access and does not perform any network operations or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for exposing environment variables in templates, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
