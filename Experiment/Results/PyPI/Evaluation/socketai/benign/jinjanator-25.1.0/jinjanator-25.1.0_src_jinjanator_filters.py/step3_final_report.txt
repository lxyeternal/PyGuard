  "purpose": "Provides a function to retrieve environment variables, with optional default, for use in templating systems.",
  "sources": "os.getenv and os.environ calls to access environment variables.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not write or transmit data, only reads environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input: environment variable name; Output: value returned by os.getenv or os.environ.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward use of standard library functions without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple utility function 'env' that safely retrieves environment variables, with optional default fallback. It exposes this function as a filter and global via hooks, enabling its use in templates. The implementation uses standard Python 'os' library calls, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic. The code's purpose is legitimate and safe. The only potential concern is that environment variables can be manipulated externally, but this is inherent to environment variables and not a flaw in the code. The security risk is minimal, and malware presence is none. The code is clear, well-documented, and adheres to best practices for such utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for exposing environment variables within a templating system. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The slight security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) reflects the inherent risk of environment variables being manipulated externally, but this does not indicate a flaw in the code itself.",
