{
  "purpose": "Define a template filter and global function for accessing environment variables in a templating system.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables via os.getenv and os.environ.",
  "sinks": "The environment variable values can be used within templates, which may influence template rendering or downstream processing.",
  "flows": "Input source: environment variables (os.getenv, os.environ). Output sink: returned values used in templates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The functions are standard for environment variable access. No obfuscation or malicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code provides safe wrappers around environment variable access, with optional default handling. No untrusted data is fetched from external sources; the environment variables are controlled by the system. The purpose is to allow templates to access environment variables securely. No dangerous code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for environment variable access in templates. No malicious intent or malicious behavior is evident. It is a standard implementation without security concerns.",
