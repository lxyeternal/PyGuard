  "purpose": "Provide a template filter and global function for accessing environment variables within a Jinja2 templating context.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.getenv and os.environ in the env function.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; environment variable values are returned as strings, used in templates.",
  "flows": "Input: Environment variable names (varname). Output: Environment variable values returned by os.getenv or os.environ.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard and safe. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'env' that retrieves environment variables, with optional default. It is integrated into a templating plugin system via hooks, returning filters and globals for use in templates. The code relies solely on standard library calls (os.getenv, os.environ). No dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious logic is present. Its purpose is to expose environment variables safely within templates. No signs of malicious intent or malware, nor unusual or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of environment variable access within a templating system. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate configuration purposes.",
