  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure CLI tool for Jinja2 templating with plugin support. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low malware score (0) and low risk score (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate, primarily reflecting the trust assumptions around plugins and templates. Overall, the code is safe and well-designed for its purpose."
