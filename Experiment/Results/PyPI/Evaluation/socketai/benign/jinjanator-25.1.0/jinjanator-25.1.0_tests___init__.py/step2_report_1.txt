  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the issues, and determine appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is primarily a set of wrapper functions around an external `render_command` function, handling files, environment variables, and options.\n- Files are opened safely within context managers.\n- Environment variables are passed directly, which is standard but could be risky if untrusted.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The external `render_command` function's behavior is unknown; security depends heavily on its implementation.\n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration within this module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code appears straightforward and does not contain any bugs or vulnerabilities within its scope.\n- The only potential concern is the reliance on an external `render_command`, which could be malicious if misused, but that is outside this code's scope.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No apparent errors or flaws in the code logic.\n- The use of `Path.cwd()` and passing environment variables directly is standard practice.\n- The only minor point is that passing untrusted environment variables or file paths could be risky, but this is typical in such utility functions.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0.2, reflecting a low but non-zero risk mainly due to reliance on external command execution and untrusted inputs.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes. The overall risk is low, assuming `render_command` is safe. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- If `render_command` is malicious, the risk could be higher, but this cannot be determined from this code alone.\n- The code handles untrusted input data, but that is typical for such utilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The code itself is benign and well-structured.\n- The main security concern lies outside this module, in the implementation of `render_command`.\n- Given the information, I would agree with the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, due to external command execution and untrusted inputs)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears secure and legitimate. The main potential risk depends on the external `render_command` implementation, which is outside this review's scope.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nContinue monitoring how `render_command` is implemented and whether it properly sanitizes inputs if security is critical. For now, the scores and analysis are appropriate.",
