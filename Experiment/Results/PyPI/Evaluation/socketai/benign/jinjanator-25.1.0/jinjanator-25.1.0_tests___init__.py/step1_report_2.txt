  "purpose": "The code provides functions to render templates using command-line interface commands, handling files and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Files opened via files.data_file.open() and environment variables passed as env parameter.",
  "sinks": "render_command function, which likely executes external commands; environment variables and file contents passed to it.",
  "flows": "Data from files and environment variables flow into render_command, potentially affecting command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. Use of environment variables is standard, but passing untrusted environment variables could pose risk if render_command is insecure.",
  "analysis": "The code reads files using standard file I/O, which appears normal. Environment variables are passed directly to render_command, but there is no evidence of their malicious use within this code. The functions mainly prepare arguments for render_command, which might invoke external processes. Without knowledge of render_command implementation, potential risks depend on how it uses the inputs. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors detected in the code. The overall structure and content seem legitimate and standard for template rendering workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a wrapper for rendering templates with external command execution. No malicious intent or security issues are evident within this module. Risks depend on the implementation details of render_command, which are not provided.",
