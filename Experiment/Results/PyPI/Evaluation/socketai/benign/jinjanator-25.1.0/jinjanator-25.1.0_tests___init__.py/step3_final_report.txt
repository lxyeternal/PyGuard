  "purpose": "Provides functions to render templates using files, options, environment variables, and external command invocation.",
  "sources": "File reading via open(), environment variables passed directly, external render_command.",
  "sinks": "render_command execution, file.open() operations.",
  "flows": "Data from files and environment variables flow into render_command as parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around an external rendering command, handling files and environment variables safely within context managers. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The external render_command's behavior is unknown but assumed safe. The code does not contain any backdoors, data leaks, or malicious patterns. Risks are primarily external, depending on render_command's implementation. The malware score is appropriately zero; obfuscation is absent; the low security risk score reflects the reliance on external command execution with untrusted inputs, but no direct malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior. The main concern depends on the external render_command, which is outside this code's scope. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2.",
