  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- **Purpose:** All reports confirm the code provides functions to render templates with files, options, environment variables, and external command invocation via `render_command`.\n- **Sources:** Files (via `open()`), environment variables, options.\n- **Sinks:** `render_command` execution, file reading.\n- **Flows:** Data from files and env variables flow into `render_command`.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. Use of `open()` is standard, and `render_command` is external with unknown behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All reports agree that the code appears standard, with no malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors within this module. Risks are primarily associated with the external `render_command`, which is outside the scope of this review.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Checks:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct, with safe file handling (`with` statements), and standard parameter passing.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code's transparency.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated at 0.2, justified by the external command execution and passing untrusted environment variables/files, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n\n- The **malware score** is 0 across all reports, consistent with no malicious code detected.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, as no obfuscation or dynamic code is present.\n- The **security risk score** of 0.2 is reasonable given potential external risks, but no direct issues are found.\n\n### Potential issues or points of concern:\n\n- The main external dependency, `render_command`, could pose risks if malicious, but this is outside this code's scope.\n- Reading files via `open()` with user-controlled paths could be risky if paths are untrusted, but this is standard practice, and no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity or payloads detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to external command execution and environment variable passing, but justified and low.\n\n**Additional comments:**\n\n- The code appears to be a standard template rendering utility, with safe file handling.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- The security risk is minimal and mainly depends on the external `render_command`.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score | Justification                                                                                  |\n|------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0            | No malicious code or behavior detected.                                                      |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | Code is clear and straightforward.                                                              |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2          | External command invocation and environment variable passing pose minor risks, but no direct issues. |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign and aligns with standard practices for template rendering.**",
