{
  "purpose": "Test function to verify behavior when a template file is not found using jinja2.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from make_file_pair, including template file path; possibly environment variables if used elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data output or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Input path assigned to template_file, then render_file invoked, which may read from the filesystem.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded template filename 'does-not-exist.j2' to trigger TemplateNotFound exception; no malicious code or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test case for handling missing template files with jinja2. It uses a factory to create a file pair, assigns a non-existent template file, and asserts that rendering this file raises the expected exception. No untrusted data handling, data leakage, or malicious actions are present. The test seems straightforward and focused on expected exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple test for missing template handling in jinja2. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be standard test code with no suspicious elements.",
