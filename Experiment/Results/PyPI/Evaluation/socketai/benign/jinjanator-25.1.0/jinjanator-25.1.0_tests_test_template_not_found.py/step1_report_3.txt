{
  "purpose": "The code tests the behavior of a template rendering function when the specified template file does not exist.",
  "sources": "make_file_pair function, files.template_file assignment",
  "sinks": "render_file function call, pytest.raises context for exception handling",
  "flows": "make_file_pair -> render_file (triggered by test) -> exception handling if file not found",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed. Usage of exception handling for expected error scenario appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a test case using pytest to verify that rendering a non-existent template file raises a TemplateNotFound exception. It uses a factory to create a file pair object, assigns a non-existent template path, and calls the render function within a pytest exception assertion. The code appears to be a standard unit test with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. There are no indications of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious code injection. The code’s structure and content align with typical testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test for handling missing template files. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues. The code is benign and aligns with standard testing patterns.",
