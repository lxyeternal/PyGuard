  "purpose": "Unit test for rendering a template file using jinja2, specifically testing handling of missing templates.",
  "sources": "make_file_pair function providing input data; Path object for 'does-not-exist.j2'.",
  "sinks": "render_file function call which processes the template; pytest.raises context manager detecting exceptions.",
  "flows": "make_file_pair generates files -> template_file path is set to non-existent file -> render_file attempts to process template -> TemplateNotFound exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. Use of standard libraries and known testing frameworks. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports safe modules (pathlib, pytest, jinja2.exceptions). It defines a test function that creates a file pair with a template string, sets the template file path to a non-existent file, and asserts that rendering raises a TemplateNotFound exception. This behavior aligns with testing template error handling, not malicious activity. No malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious network activity, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test for template rendering error handling. It performs no malicious actions or security risks. The code appears safe and intentional for testing purposes.",
