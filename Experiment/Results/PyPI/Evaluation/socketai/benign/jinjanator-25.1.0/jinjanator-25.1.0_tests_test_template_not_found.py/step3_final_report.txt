  "purpose": "Test handling of missing template files in jinja2 rendering.",
  "sources": "Path to non-existent template file set via 'files.template_file'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input: setting 'files.template_file' to a non-existent path -> render_file attempts to load template -> raises TemplateNotFound exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward test case with hardcoded filename for error simulation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple unit test verifying that 'render_file' raises 'TemplateNotFound' when the template file does not exist. It imports standard libraries and uses a factory to generate test data. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The test's purpose is error handling, not malicious activity. The code's logic is clear, and the test is typical for such scenarios. No suspicious patterns or external communications are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test for missing template handling with no security risks or malicious intent. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward test case.",
