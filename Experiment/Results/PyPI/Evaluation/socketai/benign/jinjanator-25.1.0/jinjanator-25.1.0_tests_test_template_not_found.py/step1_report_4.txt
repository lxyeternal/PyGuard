{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test function designed to verify that a template rendering function raises an exception when a non-existent template is requested.",
  "sources": "Input is received from the make_file_pair function, which generates file objects used in the test. The test also reads from the Path object (files.template_file).",
  "sinks": "The code raises an exception (TemplateNotFound) intentionally; no external data is sent over the network or written to files.",
  "flows": "The test function calls render_file with a file object that points to a non-existent template, which triggers the TemplateNotFound exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard testing practices with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a test case that intentionally causes a TemplateNotFound exception by pointing to a non-existent template file. It relies on the pytest framework and jinja2 exceptions, which are standard libraries. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The test simply verifies exception handling for a missing file, which is a normal and expected part of robust testing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test that checks for correct handling of missing templates. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
