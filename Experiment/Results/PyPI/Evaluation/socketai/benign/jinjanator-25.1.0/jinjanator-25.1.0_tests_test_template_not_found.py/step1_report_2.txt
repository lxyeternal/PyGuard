  "purpose": "Unit test to verify behavior of the 'render_file' function when the template file does not exist.",
  "sources": "make_file_pair creates a template file, files.template_file reads a file path; pytest.raises captures exceptions.",
  "sinks": "render_file function potentially reads the file specified by files.template_file.",
  "flows": "make_file_pair -> render_file (triggered by test_template_not_found) when template file is missing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious function calls or data leaks; use of Path object is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a test scenario where a non-existent template file is specified to 'render_file'. The test expects a 'TemplateNotFound' exception to be raised, indicating proper error handling for missing files. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. Usage of pytest for testing and standard library modules is typical. No suspicious data flows, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no unusual code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test for template rendering error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
