{
  "purpose": "This code defines version-related variables for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to track and manage package version information.",
  "sources": "The assignment of version strings and tuples, which are hardcoded values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations; no data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A, as all values are statically assigned without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a conditional block with type checking that defines version tuple types, but it does not perform any dynamic or suspicious operations. The code is straightforward and typical for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up version variables using static values, with a conditional to support type checking. No external data input, environment variables, or network operations are present. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs. The only notable feature is the use of a conditional for type checking, which is standard in modern Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version definition file generated by setuptools_scm with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply assigns static version information and includes type checking support.",
