{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to manage package versioning.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns static version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely initializes version variables internally.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes conditional type-checking imports, which are standard and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script sets version information using static assignments. It includes conditional import logic for type checking, a common pattern in modern Python code. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard package versioning practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration generated by setuptools_scm. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
