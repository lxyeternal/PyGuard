  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code is a boilerplate version management snippet generated by `setuptools_scm`.\n   - It assigns static version strings and tuples.\n   - It includes a conditional import for type checking (`TYPE_CHECKING`), which is standard practice.\n   - There are no dynamic inputs, external data, network calls, or other I/O operations.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, static, and boilerplate.\n   - No flaws or suspicious reasoning are evident; the assessments are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Score Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign scores of 1 for confidence and 0 for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable in their scoring.\n\n4. **Malware and Security Risk**:\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No external communication, data exfiltration, or code injection is present.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities**:\n   - The code does not contain vulnerabilities; it is purely for version info.\n   - No assumptions are made about external inputs or dynamic behavior.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency and Additional Insights**:\n   - The reports are thorough and align with the code's nature.\n   - The code's purpose is clear, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My Personal Estimate**:\nGiven the code and reports, I concur with the provided scores. The code is standard, benign version info code, with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a typical auto-generated version management snippet.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- Scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \n**Malware Score**: 0  \n**Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n**Risk Score**: 0",
