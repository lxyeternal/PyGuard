  "purpose": "This code defines version-related variables for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to manage version information.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables, based on static version data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or external inputs are involved.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static assignments without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated version management snippet from setuptools_scm. It conditionally imports typing components when type checking is enabled and assigns version information statically when not. There are no inputs, external data handling, or dynamic behaviors. The code is straightforward and intended solely for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard version info management code with no malicious intent or security risks.",
