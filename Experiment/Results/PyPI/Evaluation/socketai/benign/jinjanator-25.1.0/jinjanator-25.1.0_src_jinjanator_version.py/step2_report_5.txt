  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a straightforward, boilerplate version management snippet generated by setuptools_scm.\n   - It assigns static version strings and tuples, with a conditional import for type checking.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, or external communications.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is standard, boilerplate, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - They note the absence of dynamic code, external data handling, or obfuscation.\n   - The analysis in each report is consistent and reasonable.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n   - No issues are present in the code.\n   - The reports are thorough and accurate in their reasoning.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a standard version info snippet with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, safe version management snippet generated by setuptools_scm. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring reflects this accurately.",
