  "purpose": "The code provides static version information generated by setuptools_scm, used for package versioning.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static assignment of version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment without dynamic or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward boilerplate code with conditional type checking.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, generated version management snippet. It conditionally imports typing constructs for type checking and assigns static version strings and tuples. There are no dynamic behaviors, external inputs, outputs, or network activity. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code's purpose is solely to hold version information, and it does not perform any operations that could compromise security. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate. The confidence scores of 1 reflect high certainty in this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version info snippet generated by setuptools_scm. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
