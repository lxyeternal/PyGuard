  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package using setuptools_scm-generated code.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, conditional import based on TYPE_CHECKING.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; only static data assignments.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static data assignments without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only manages version info with no dynamic execution or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables for a package, with a conditional import for type checking. It uses static string and tuple assignments for version info. There are no indications of input, output, or malicious behavior. The code is simple, standard for version management, and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version info setup generated by setuptools_scm with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It serves a straightforward purpose of defining version variables without external dependencies or untrusted data handling.",
