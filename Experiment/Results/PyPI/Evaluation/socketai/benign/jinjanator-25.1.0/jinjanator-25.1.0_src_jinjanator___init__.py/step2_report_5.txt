  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nThe code simply imports two version-related variables (`__version__` and `version`) from a local module named `.version`, then defines `__all__` to specify what symbols are exported. This is a common pattern for version declaration in Python packages.  \n**Confirmed:** The code matches the description and purpose in all reports. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**  \n- No untrusted data processing or external inputs.  \n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.  \n- No data flows to external sinks or from untrusted sources.  \n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for package version management.\n\n**Confirmed:** The code is benign and does not contain security issues or malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.  \n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable because the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n**Any adjustments?**  \n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis. No changes needed.\n\n4. **Critical Evaluation of Claims**  \n- The reports claim no anomalies, suspicious behavior, or security concerns. This aligns with the code content.  \n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is accurate.\n\n5. **Summary and Final Justification**  \n- The code is a typical version declaration snippet, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.  \n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign purpose.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. The code is safe, and no further security concerns are identified.",
