  "purpose": "Define and export version information for the package",
  "sources": "Importing version data from a local module '.version'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows identified",
  "flows": "Import source to __all__ assignment; no data flow to external systems or sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information from a relative module, then exposes these as part of the public API via __all__. It is a simple version management pattern with no evident malicious intent. The code does not handle user input, environment variables, or external data sources. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or data exfiltration methods are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and serves to expose version variables; it shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
