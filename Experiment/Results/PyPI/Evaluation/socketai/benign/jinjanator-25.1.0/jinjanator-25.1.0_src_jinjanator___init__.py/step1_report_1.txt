{
  "purpose": "This code is used to define and export version information for a Python module.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a local module 'version' that provides version strings (__version__ and version).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted or external data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "The version data is imported from a local module and then exposed via __all__, with no data flow to external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information from a local module 'version'. It then sets __all__ to specify what symbols are exported when the module is imported elsewhere. No user input, network operations, or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a standard module version definition pattern, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version declaration for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
