  "purpose": "Minimal version declaration module importing version info from a local module and exposing it via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .version module for __version__ and version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external inputs, or data flows; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only imports and exposes variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version variables from a local module and exposes them via __all__, serving as a version info module. No dynamic behavior, external data, or malicious constructs are present. The code is minimal, standard, and safe. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with full confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration pattern with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
