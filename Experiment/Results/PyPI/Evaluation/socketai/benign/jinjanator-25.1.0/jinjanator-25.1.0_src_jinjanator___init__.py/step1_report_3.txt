{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be defining module metadata by importing version information and setting the public API variables.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.version' to import __version__ and version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the local module import to the __all__ declaration, with no data passing to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are evident; the code is straightforward and minimal, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information from a relative module, likely for package metadata purposes. It then defines __all__ to specify exported symbols. There are no indications of data processing, external communication, or malicious behavior. The structure and content are typical for Python package modules, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup snippet for managing version information and defining public API symbols. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
