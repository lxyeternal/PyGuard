  "conclusion": "The code's pattern of dynamically loading and executing external Python files without validation poses a high security risk and potential for malicious activity. The existing reports correctly identify this risk, and their scores are generally justified. The only adjustment needed is increasing the malware score in report 4 from 0 to 0.75 to better reflect the potential for malicious code execution. Overall, the code should be refactored to use safer import mechanisms, validation, or sandboxing to mitigate these risks."
