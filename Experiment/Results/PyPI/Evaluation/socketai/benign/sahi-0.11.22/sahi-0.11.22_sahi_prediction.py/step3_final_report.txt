{
  "purpose": "The code handles object detection predictions, including creation, transformation, visualization, and format conversion, primarily for image analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads images via 'read_image_as_pil()', loads optional modules like 'fiftyone', and accesses class attributes for predictions.",
  "sinks": "Exports visualization images, converts predictions to various formats, and may load external libraries; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Image data flows into prediction objects, which are transformed and exported; optional dependencies are imported dynamically, with no external network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual data flows detected. Optional import of 'fiftyone' is handled safely.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for handling object detection predictions, with safe use of external libraries, no malicious patterns, and no obfuscation. It processes images and prediction data securely, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior or security risks. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and very low risk score (~0.1) are justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
