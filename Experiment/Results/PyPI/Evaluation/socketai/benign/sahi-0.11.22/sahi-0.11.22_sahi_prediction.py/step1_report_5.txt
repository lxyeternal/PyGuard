{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for handling object detection predictions and results, including visualization and conversion to different annotation formats.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (numpy, PIL, sahi utilities), reads images via read_image_as_pil, reads image data in constructor, accepts prediction data (bbox, score, segmentation).",
  "sinks": "Exports visuals using visualize_object_predictions, potentially writes files to specified directories, converts predictions to external formats (COCO, FiftyOne).",
  "flows": "Reads input images, processes prediction data, visualizes and exports images, converts data formats, and potentially writes files to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed. Import of optional libraries (fiftyone) is guarded with try-except.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard object detection prediction handling: defining prediction classes, converting predictions to different formats, visualizing predictions, and reading/writing images. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns such as network calls, data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injections. Use of external libraries appears legitimate and standard for such tasks. No obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or suspicious code structures are present. File operations are limited to saving visualizations and data exports, typical for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate object detection utility module, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It facilitates prediction management, visualization, and conversion with standard methods. No security risks or malware signals are identified.",
