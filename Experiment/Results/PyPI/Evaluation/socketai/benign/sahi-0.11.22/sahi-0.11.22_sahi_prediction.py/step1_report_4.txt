{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and methods for handling object detection predictions, including visualizations, conversions to various formats, and processing prediction scores.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from image files (read_image_as_pil), prediction scores, and optional external modules.",
  "sinks": "Conversion methods may generate outputs like visualizations, JSON data, or external library calls. No direct sink for untrusted data is evident.",
  "flows": "Input image data and prediction scores are processed into various formats. No evident flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic imports for optional libraries (fiftyone), but this is common and not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles object detection predictions, converting between formats and visualizations. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of external libraries is controlled, and no dangerous code constructs are evident. The dynamic import of fiftyone is standard for optional features. There are no obfuscated code patterns or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for object detection result handling with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
