  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is standard, with no suspicious behavior, no external untrusted data, no network activity, no backdoors, and no obfuscation. The malware score is 0, security risk is 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is indeed primarily data handling, conversion, and visualization, with no signs of malicious activity. The high confidence (0.9) aligns with the thorough reasoning.\n\n- **Potential Issue:** The report's malware score is 0, which seems appropriate given the analysis. The security risk is 0, which might be slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on safe handling, standard external dependencies, and no suspicious code. Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's functions are benign. The slightly higher security risk score (0.2) might reflect minimal external dependency use, but still no malicious activity.\n\n- **Potential Issue:** No issues here; the reasoning and scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is described as handling detection predictions, with safe external library usage, optional modules handled via try-except, no suspicious patterns, malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n- **Potential Issue:** No concerns; the analysis aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with standard handling, no suspicious behavior, optional dependencies managed properly, malware score 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears benign, and the reasoning is sound.\n\n- **Potential Issue:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard code for prediction handling, visualization, and format conversion, with no suspicious patterns, safe external library usage, malware score 0, security risk 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code is a typical object detection prediction handling module, with no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is justified. No malicious behavior is detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** The risk scores are low, mostly 0 or 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal external dependencies and standard practices.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code, a risk score of around 0.1-0.2 seems appropriate. The existing scores are reasonable.\n\n- **Confidence Level:** High confidence (around 0.9) is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  | Justification |\n|----------|-----------|--------------|--------|----------------|\n| 1        | 0         | 0            | 0.0    | No malicious behavior, standard code. |\n| 2        | 0         | 0            | 0.2    | Slight external dependency use, still benign. |\n| 3        | 0         | 0            | 0.1    | Safe optional imports, no suspicious activity. |\n| 4        | 0         | 0            | 0.2    | Standard handling, no risks. |\n| 5        | 0         | 0            | 0.0    | Legitimate code, no malicious signs. |\n\n**Final note:** The provided code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation, and the risk scores are appropriately low.\n\n---",
