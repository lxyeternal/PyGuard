{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for handling object detection predictions, including visualization and conversion to various formats such as COCO and FiftyOne.",
  "sources": "Reads input images via 'read_image_as_pil' and optional external libraries like 'fiftyone'. Uses 'np' for numpy data, and processes object detection data provided via parameters.",
  "sinks": "Exports visualizations to specified directories, converts predictions to JSON formats, and interacts with external libraries. No data leaks or untrusted data execution detected.",
  "flows": "Input images are read via 'read_image_as_pil'. Prediction data flows from initial inputs into object prediction objects, which are then exported or converted. External library imports are used within methods for specific conversions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code relies on standard libraries and well-documented external packages.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles object detection data structures, visualization, and format conversions. It includes safe use of standard and external libraries with no evidence of malicious activities. No untrusted data execution, code injection, or privacy violations are observed. External dependencies are used appropriately for specific tasks. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and consistent with typical object detection pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation for object detection handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses external libraries in a typical manner, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code flows.",
