  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "External variables, user input, network connections, environment variables, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec), data flow from input to output.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, file systems, environment variables, system commands, external data stores.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user/env/network) to sinks (network, file, system commands) via code execution or data handling functions.",
  "anomalies": "Potential use of eval/exec, obfuscated code, hardcoded IPs or secrets, suspicious network activity, complex or minified code without explanation.",
  "analysis": "The code appears minimal or benign in most reports, with no explicit malicious patterns or obfuscation. Suspicion arises mainly from reports noting potential eval/exec usage, network activity, or code complexity, but without concrete code snippets, these are speculative. Scores assigned are generally consistent with the described observations. Report 2 shows some suspicion with moderate malware (0.3) and obfuscation (0.4), which could be slightly lowered if no confirmed malicious patterns are present. Reports with no code or benign descriptions correctly assign zero scores. Overall, the assessments are cautious but reasonable, with minor adjustments suggested for Report 2 to better reflect the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, with scores aligning to their observations. Report 2's suspicion warrants a slightly lower malware score unless further evidence confirms malicious patterns. The overall security posture is low to moderate, primarily due to the cautious suspicion in Report 2. No significant overestimations are evident, and the scores are appropriate given the limited information.",
