  "flows": "Input parameters (model_type, paths, configs) are used to dynamically import and instantiate detection models, passing parameters directly to the constructor.",
  "anomalies": "Use of import_model_class for dynamic class import based on user input; no apparent validation of user inputs before import.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically maps model types to class names and imports the corresponding class at runtime, then instantiates it with user-supplied arguments. The import_model_class function could potentially be exploited if it is not securely implemented, as it may import arbitrary modules based on input. However, this function is external, and assuming standard behavior, it appears to import specific classes related to detection models based on provided strings. The rest of the code mainly passes user inputs to class constructors, with no evidence of unsafe evaluation, code injection, or malicious behavior. The use of optional parameters and type hints suggests intended flexibility but does not introduce malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, network connections, or data leaks within this snippet. Overall, the code's malicious potential depends heavily on the implementation of import_model_class, but within this snippet, there is no clear malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs dynamic importing and model instantiation based on user input. No direct evidence of malicious behavior or malware is observed. Potential concern is the dynamic import mechanism, which should be secured, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a typical factory pattern for model loading with no malicious features.",
