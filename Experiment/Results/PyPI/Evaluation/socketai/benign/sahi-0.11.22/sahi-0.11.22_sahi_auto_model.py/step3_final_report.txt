{
  "purpose": "Provides a factory method to dynamically load and instantiate detection models based on user-specified parameters, using a controlled mapping and external import function.",
  "sources": "User input for model_type, model_path, config_path, device, thresholds, category mappings, and other parameters.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of imported model class with provided parameters; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> model_type normalization -> mapping to class name -> dynamic import via import_model_class -> class instantiation with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected. The main external risk is in the implementation of import_model_class, which is outside this code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard factory pattern with controlled dynamic import based on predefined mappings. It normalizes model_type inputs, uses a secure mapping, and calls an external function to import classes. No suspicious behaviors, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is the external import function's implementation, which must validate inputs to prevent arbitrary code execution. The code itself appears safe and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured dynamic model loader with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security consideration is ensuring the external import function is implemented securely. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal risk due to dynamic import reliance.",
