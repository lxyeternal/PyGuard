  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured dynamic model loader with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security consideration is ensuring the external import function is implemented securely. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal risk due to dynamic import reliance."
