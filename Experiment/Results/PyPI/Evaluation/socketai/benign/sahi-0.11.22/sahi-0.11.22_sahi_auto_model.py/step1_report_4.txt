  "purpose": "Factory class to instantiate and load pre-trained object detection models from various frameworks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as model_type, model_path, config_path, device, and other configuration options.",
  "sinks": "The import_model_class function could potentially execute dynamic code if misused, and the returned DetectionModel could execute malicious inference code if compromised.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to dynamically select and import model classes, then instantiate DetectionModel objects with provided parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic class import via import_model_class; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code is evident. The mapping dictionaries are static.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured approach to load different detection models based on provided parameters. It dynamically imports model classes based on user input, which could be risky if import_model_class is malicious or improperly implemented, but this is a common pattern in plugin-based systems. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity is evident. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors are detected. The parameters allow configuration but do not contain hardcoded secrets or dangerous behaviors. The overall structure appears legitimate, aimed at flexibility in model loading.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate factory for loading detection models dynamically. There are no signs of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads. Its reliance on external dynamic imports warrants trust in the import_model_class implementation but does not, by itself, suggest malicious activity.",
