  "purpose": "The code provides a factory method to load pre-trained detection models based on specified framework types and parameters.",
  "sources": "model_type parameter, model_path parameter, config_path parameter, and other configuration parameters passed to from_pretrained method",
  "sinks": "import_model_class function (which loads a class dynamically), instantiation of DetectionModel with potentially untrusted data",
  "flows": "model_type input influences which class is imported via import_model_class; model_path, config_path, and other parameters are passed into the constructor of the imported DetectionModel class",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic class import via import_model_class based on user-supplied model_type; no hardcoded secrets, but dynamic import can be risky if input is maliciously crafted. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behaviors such as network connections, file manipulations, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class method to load detection models dynamically based on user input. It uses a mapping to determine the class to import and relies on an external function import_model_class to handle dynamic class loading. The parameters are sanitized to some extent, relying on predefined model type names. The dynamic import via import_model_class could be exploited if an attacker supplies a malicious model_type string that tricks the import process, but this depends on the implementation of import_model_class, which is not provided. The method returns an instance of a DetectionModel or a subclass, instantiated with user-supplied parameters. There are no signs of malicious payloads, code injection, backdoors, or network activity. The code appears to be a straightforward factory for models, with no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard factory method for dynamically loading detection models based on provided parameters. It uses dynamic class import but appears to be limited to predefined models and does not contain malicious or maliciously obfuscated code. Potential concern is the dynamic import function, which must be implemented securely, but within this snippet, no malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
