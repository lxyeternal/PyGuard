  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code details, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility for handling annotations, with no malicious behavior observed.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — aligns with the report; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code appears clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, given no security concerns.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the benign nature of the code. The only dynamic import is for optional 'imantics', which is safely wrapped. No signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on data handling and format conversions.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, as no security issues are evident.\n- **Assessment:** The report accurately describes the code's purpose and safety. The optional 'imantics' import is not suspicious.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on annotation handling, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes the safe practices, including conditional imports and standard data validation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes the code as data structures and utilities for annotations, with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — aligns with the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code clarity is evident.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — no security risks identified.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion matches the code's functionality and behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the benign nature.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — no security concerns.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly interprets the code's purpose and safety.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as there is no malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the code's nature as a data utility module.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- The code is a standard annotation handling utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- The only minor point is the optional 'imantics' import, which is safely wrapped and does not introduce risk.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — negligible, mostly due to optional dependencies and standard data handling.\n\n**In summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable based on the code provided.",
