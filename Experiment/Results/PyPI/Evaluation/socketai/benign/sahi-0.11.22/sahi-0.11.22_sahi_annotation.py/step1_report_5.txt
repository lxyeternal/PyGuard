{
  "purpose": "Defines classes and methods for representing and manipulating object annotations such as bounding boxes, masks, and categories, mainly for use in computer vision tasks like object detection and segmentation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input arguments such as masks, bounding boxes, and annotation dictionaries; also imports from third-party libraries (numpy, sahi.utils, imantics).",
  "sinks": "Transforms and returns annotation representations; no sinks involve untrusted data leading to security effects or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows mainly from input parameters to class attributes and conversion methods (e.g., to_coco_annotation, to_shapely_annotation); no external data flows or network communication are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; no obfuscated code or malicious system commands. The only import that could pose concerns is 'imantics', but it is wrapped with a try-except block for safe import.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data classes for object annotations, with methods for creating, converting, and manipulating annotations. It uses standard libraries and well-known third-party libraries for processing. The import of 'imantics' is conditional and encapsulated with error handling, minimizing risk. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. There are no signs of malicious payloads or covert channels. The code appears to be a standard implementation for annotation handling in CV pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical annotation utility module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It processes image annotation data and converts between formats safely. No indicators of malware or security risks are detected.",
