{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import modules related to object detection and annotation, likely for use in computer vision tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from the sahi library modules: sahi.annotation, sahi.auto_model, sahi.models.base, sahi.prediction.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks in this code snippet, as it only contains import statements with no data processing or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink in this snippet; only module imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code solely imports modules without executing any suspicious or unusual functions.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports specific classes from the sahi library, which is used for object detection and annotation tasks. There are no functions, data processing, or network operations present. The imports are from standard-looking libraries related to computer vision workflows, with no indication of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import of modules for object detection and annotation, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, benign computer vision project.",
