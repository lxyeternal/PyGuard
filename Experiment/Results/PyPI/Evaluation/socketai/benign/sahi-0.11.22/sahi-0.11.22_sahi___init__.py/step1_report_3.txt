{
  "purpose": "Import statements for a computer vision annotation and detection framework, likely used for object detection tasks.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; only module imports are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths since the code only imports modules and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be straightforward module import and version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports several classes from the 'sahi' library related to object detection and annotation. There are no functions, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious operations such as network communication, credential handling, or obfuscation. The imports are standard for a computer vision model pipeline. No malicious or suspicious activity is observable based solely on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as setup for an object detection or annotation project using the 'sahi' library. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
