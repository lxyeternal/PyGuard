{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be importing modules related to object detection and annotation, likely for computer vision tasks.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading is evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, output, or data leakage points are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths; only import statements are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely consists of import statements with no additional logic; no suspicious or unusual code structures are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from the 'sahi' library, which is used for object detection and annotation tasks in computer vision projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. No data processing, network activity, or potential attack vectors are evident. The code is standard for setting up a detection or annotation pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, consisting only of module imports for computer vision annotations and detection models. There is no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security concerns based on this limited fragment.",
