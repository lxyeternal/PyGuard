  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- The code provides utility functions to check package availability, versions, and environment info.\n- It uses standard Python modules: importlib, importlib.metadata, os, logging, and packaging.\n- It performs environment checks, logs info/warnings, and raises errors if dependencies are missing or outdated.\n- No external network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The functions are straightforward, relying on well-known libraries, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes environment/package info functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks; flows are standard.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign utility code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0.0, Security Risk 0.0, Confidence 1.0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes dependency checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard dependency validation, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0, Security Risk 0.1, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. The low security risk score (0.1) reflects minimal concern, which is reasonable. No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transmission or dangerous operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical dependency management code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0, Security Risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The minimal security risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious operations.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign utility code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0, Security Risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious actions.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard environment/package validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0, Security Risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, reflecting minimal concern due to potential misconfiguration or dependency issues, not malicious intent.\n\n### **Final Justification & Recommendations**\n\n- The code performs standard dependency checks and environment info collection.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain attack vectors.\n- The low security risk scores are appropriate given the functions' benign nature.\n- The malware scores should remain at 0.0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores should stay at 0, as code is clear.\n- The security risk scores can be slightly above zero (e.g., 0.1) to acknowledge that dependency misconfigurations could pose minor operational risks, but these are not security threats.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Category          | Score  |\n|-------------------|---------|\n| Malware           | 0.0     |\n| Obfuscated        | 0.0     |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1     |\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code's benign nature. No modifications are necessary. The code is a standard, safe utility for environment and dependency validation.",
