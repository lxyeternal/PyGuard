  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign utility for checking package availability and versions, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The functions perform straightforward package info retrieval and logging, with no external data flow or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0\n- **Justification:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent. The high confidence score (1.0) is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes the code as a dependency checker with no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis confirms no network activity, no obfuscated code, and standard practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** The small security risk score (0.1) might be considering the potential for misconfiguration or misuse, but the code itself is benign. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a dependency validation utility with no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The detailed analysis shows standard use of importlib and packaging modules, with no external communication or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** The same reasoning applies; the code is benign, and the low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility for dependency checks, with no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The functions are straightforward, with standard logging and package info retrieval.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity; the zero risk score aligns with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar environment and dependency validation utility.\n- **Assessment:** Uses standard modules, no external network activity, no obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0\n- **Justification:** Consistent with other reports; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0.0, and the code contains no malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied between 0.0 and 0.1, but given the benign nature, a risk score of 0.0 is justified.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.0** — Standard dependency check code with no external or dangerous operations.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard utility for environment and dependency management. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening aspects are present. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, with the overall assessment confirming the benign nature.",
