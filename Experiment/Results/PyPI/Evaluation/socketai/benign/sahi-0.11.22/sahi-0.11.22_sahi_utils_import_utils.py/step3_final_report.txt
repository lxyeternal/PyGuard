  "purpose": "Utility functions for checking package availability, versions, and printing environment info.",
  "sources": "Reads package info via importlib.metadata, importlib, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission or untrusted data sinks; only logging and package info retrieval.",
  "flows": "Source: package/module info retrieval; Sink: logging outputs and return values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward dependency checks, environment info collection, and logging using standard Python modules. It does not execute external code, communicate over networks, or handle untrusted input beyond package name checks. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The functions are well-structured, with clear purpose and safe practices. The minimal security risk stems from dependency management, which is standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for environment and dependency validation. It poses no malicious threat, contains no obfuscation, and has negligible security risks. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
