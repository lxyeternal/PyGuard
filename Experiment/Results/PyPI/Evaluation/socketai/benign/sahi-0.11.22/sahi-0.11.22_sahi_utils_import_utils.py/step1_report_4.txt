{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for checking the availability and versions of Python packages, as well as printing environment info about specific libraries.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (LOGLEVEL), imports modules (importlib.util, importlib.metadata, os, logging), and calls get_package_info which imports other modules (importlib, packaging).",
  "sinks": "Uses logger.info and logger.warning for info and warnings. Does not write or transmit data over network. No unsafe system calls or file operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variable LOGLEVEL -> configures logging; Calls get_package_info -> potentially imports package modules to get version info; check_requirements and ensure_package_minimum_version call get_package_info -> may raise ImportError if requirements not met.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code is present. Uses standard package and environment inspection methods. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code relies on standard Python library functions to inspect installed packages and their versions, and to print environment information. No external network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Error handling is limited to raising ImportError if packages are missing or outdated. Logging is used for info and warnings but is standard and not suspicious. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for managing and inspecting package dependencies and environment details. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code. It performs safe, standard operations for package management and environment info collection.",
