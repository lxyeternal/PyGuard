  "sources": "Environment variables (LOGLEVEL), importlib.util.find_spec, get_package_info, and package version retrieval functions.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Environment variable sets logging level -> get_package_info reads package info -> check_package_minimum_version and ensure_package_minimum_version validate versions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. The code only performs package and environment info checks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package availability and version checks using importlib and packaging modules. It logs info and warnings based on package info. The environment info function checks for several ML-related packages, but does not execute or fetch data from external sources or perform suspicious operations. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for environment and package management. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
