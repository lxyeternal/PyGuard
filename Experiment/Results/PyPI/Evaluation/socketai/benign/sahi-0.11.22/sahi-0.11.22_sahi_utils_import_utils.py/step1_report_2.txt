{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to check for the availability and versions of various machine learning and computer vision packages, and to provide environment information.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables for logging level, imports modules, and checks for package presence and versions using importlib and importlib.metadata.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs logs and raises exceptions, but does not process or send untrusted data externally.",
  "flows": "Input (package names, environment variables) -> checks availability/version -> logs info or raises exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors are apparent. The use of importlib and version checks is standard for environment validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment and dependency checks for common ML packages, using standard Python libraries like importlib and packaging. It reads environment variables for logging configuration, queries package metadata, and raises errors if requirements are unmet. There are no network connections, data leaks, or malicious code injections. The functions are straightforward, and no code indicates malicious intent or sabotage. No obfuscated code features or suspicious dynamic execution are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility for environment validation, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It performs benign checks for package availability and version compliance, and logs or raises errors accordingly.",
