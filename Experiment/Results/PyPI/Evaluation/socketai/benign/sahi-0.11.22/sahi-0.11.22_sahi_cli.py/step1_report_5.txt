{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a command-line interface (CLI) for the SAHI library, providing access to various functions and scripts related to object detection and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'fire', 'sahi' modules, and predefined dictionaries containing references to functions and version info.",
  "sinks": "The 'fire.Fire' call at the end exposes the app functions to CLI input; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "User inputs via CLI are processed by 'fire.Fire' which invokes functions from 'sahi_app' and its nested dictionaries based on command-line arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. All functions appear to be standard utility functions from the SAHI library. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports functions from the 'sahi' package and organizes them into dictionaries for CLI access. It uses 'fire' to automatically generate CLI commands. No data is read from external sources within this code snippet; it mainly exposes functions. The functions imported are from a well-known object detection library, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands. The 'fire' module's use is standard for CLI applications and does not inherently introduce security risks. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a CLI wrapper for the SAHI library, providing access to its various features. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in the provided code.",
