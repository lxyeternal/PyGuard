  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Backdoors:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around the SAHI library functions.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration.\n   - The functions invoked are standard utility functions related to object detection and evaluation, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n2. **Potential Vulnerabilities:**\n   - The code relies on user input via CLI, which could lead to misuse if the underlying functions are vulnerable, but this is typical for CLI tools.\n   - No evidence of unsafe handling of untrusted data within this script.\n   - The 'fire' library is a common CLI tool and does not inherently introduce security issues.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** Consistently 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** Generally very low (0 to 0.2), aligning with the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Any Inconsistencies or Unreasonable Scores?**\n   - The scores seem consistent with the code's analysis—no signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n   - Slight variation in confidence levels and security risk scores is acceptable given the subjective nature of some assessments, but overall, they are aligned with the findings.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The code depends on external modules; if those modules are compromised, the risk could increase, but within this script, there's no evidence of such issues.\n   - The reports do not mention any suspicious patterns or assumptions that could lead to false positives.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, given the benign nature and lack of vulnerabilities)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard CLI wrapper exposing functions from the SAHI library. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. The minimal security risk is primarily due to the reliance on external functions that are not visible here, but within this script, no issues are present.",
