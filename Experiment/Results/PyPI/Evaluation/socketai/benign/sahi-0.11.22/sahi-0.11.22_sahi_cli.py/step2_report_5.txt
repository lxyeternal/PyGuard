  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes the code as a CLI wrapper exposing SAHI functions.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No untrusted data handling is evident; user inputs go through 'fire' to invoke functions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward CLI setup, importing functions, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, safe, no security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 (possibly slightly overcautious but acceptable given minimal risk).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Clear, standard CLI wrapper with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to previous, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0, consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar findings; no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0, consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 (a very low, acceptable risk).\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Malware risk:** Scores are all zero or near-zero, aligning with the code's benign nature.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, mainly because the code acts as a CLI dispatcher without processing untrusted data directly or performing risky operations.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are generally reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- The slightly elevated risk score in Report 1 (0.2) could be marginally increased to 0.3 to reflect cautiousness, but it's acceptable.\n- The malware scores should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- The obfuscated scores should stay at 0.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n**The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper exposing functions from the SAHI library. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.** The current scoring reflects this accurately, with only minor adjustments if desired for conservative risk assessment.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3 (to account for cautious assessment, but 0.2 is acceptable)\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code appears safe and benign.",
