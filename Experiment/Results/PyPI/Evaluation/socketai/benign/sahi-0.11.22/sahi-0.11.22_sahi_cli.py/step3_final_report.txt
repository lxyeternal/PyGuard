{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a CLI wrapper that exposes functions from the 'sahi' library via the 'fire' command-line interface, enabling users to run evaluation, prediction, and conversion scripts through CLI commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input via command-line arguments processed by 'fire', which then invokes corresponding functions from the 'sahi' library.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks for untrusted data; the script only maps CLI commands to existing library functions without processing external data internally.",
  "flows": "User inputs CLI commands -> 'fire' processes commands -> mapped functions from 'sahi' are invoked; no data flows from untrusted sources within this script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and relies on trusted external modules.",
  "analysis": "The script imports functions from the 'sahi' library and organizes them into nested dictionaries for CLI command mapping. It uses 'fire.Fire' to enable command-line invocation of these functions. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or insecure data handling. The code's simplicity and reliance on external, presumably trusted, modules indicate a benign purpose. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI interface exposing existing library functions without any malicious intent or security issues. It is safe for use, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
