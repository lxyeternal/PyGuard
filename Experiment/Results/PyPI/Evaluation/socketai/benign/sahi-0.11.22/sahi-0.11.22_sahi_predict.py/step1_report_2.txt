{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for object detection predictions, including slicing images, applying models, postprocessing, and exporting results, as well as integrating with FiftyOne for dataset management and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Reading image files or video streams; importing models; user-provided configuration files; exporting images, annotations, and pickle files; visualizing predictions; reading ground truth annotations.",
  "sinks": "Saving prediction results as pickle files; exporting cropped images; saving visualizations; writing JSON files with detection results; displaying images/video via OpenCV; launching web app for dataset visualization.",
  "flows": "Input data (images, videos, configs) → model inference and postprocessing → export/save predictions, visualizations, and JSON annotations → optional visualization in web app or video display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or secret exfiltration found. The code uses standard libraries and public model interfaces. No network activity or external data leaks detected. Model loading and inference follow typical patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs object detection prediction workflows, including image/video input handling, slicing, model inference, postprocessing, and exporting results. It uses standard libraries, well-known open-source dependencies, and typical data handling practices. No signs of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or covert channels are present. The functions and imports are consistent with legitimate object detection workflows. The use of visualization and dataset evaluation tools aligns with common practices in computer vision projects. There are no indications of backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. Overall, the code appears to be a standard open-source object detection pipeline with dataset integration.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical open-source object detection and dataset management script, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It uses standard libraries and patterns without hidden or suspicious behaviors. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is very low.",
