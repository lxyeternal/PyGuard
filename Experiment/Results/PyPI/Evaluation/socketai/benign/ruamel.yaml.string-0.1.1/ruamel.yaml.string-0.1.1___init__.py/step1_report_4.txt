  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the 'ruamel.yaml.string' module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the _package_data dictionary and access to its values.",
  "sinks": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static data assignment only.",
  "flows": "Assignment of dictionary data to variables, with no dynamic or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines package metadata using a static dictionary and assigns specific fields to variables. It imports no external data, executes no dynamic code, and does not perform any network or file operations. The 'install_requires' field specifies dependencies, which is standard. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign metadata definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured package information.",
