{
  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata for a Python module related to YAML processing, including version info, author, description, dependencies, and other metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the '_package_data' dictionary to set version information.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "The flow is simple: data is read from '_package_data' and assigned to variables 'version_info' and '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and only handles static package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a dictionary containing package metadata, including version, author, description, dependencies, and other details. It then extracts version information into variables. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, input/output operations, or hidden behavior. The code appears to be standard package metadata definition without any malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package metadata snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines and assigns static data relevant for a Python package. No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected.",
