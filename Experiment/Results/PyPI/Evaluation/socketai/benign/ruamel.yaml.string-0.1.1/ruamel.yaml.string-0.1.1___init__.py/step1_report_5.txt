  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the 'ruamel.yaml.string' Python package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of package data dictionary, access to dictionary keys for version info and version string.",
  "sinks": "None that pose security risks; no data output, network operations, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A — static assignment and data retrieval within the package initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward metadata definition without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a dictionary containing package metadata, such as name, version, author, description, and dependencies. It then extracts version information from this dictionary for later use. The code is simple, static, and does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execution of external code. There are no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package metadata setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be normal and safe for use.",
