  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate but complex setup utility that employs environment-dependent behaviors and dynamic configuration. While no malicious payloads are detected, its patterns of executing external commands based on environment variables introduce moderate security risks. It should be used with caution and proper environment controls."
