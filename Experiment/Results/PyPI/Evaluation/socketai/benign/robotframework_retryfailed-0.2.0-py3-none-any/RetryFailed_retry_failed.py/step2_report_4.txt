  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Implements retry logic based on test tags, modifies test objects, and output XML files.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected. It manipulates test execution flow in a way consistent with retry mechanisms.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is low, justified by the code's purpose.\n- **Overall:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on retry logic, parsing tags, and updating test results.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent or obfuscation; standard API usage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 is justified given the code's nature.\n- **Overall:** The reasoning is consistent and sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, a retry mechanism with configuration via tags, modifying test results.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; straightforward retry logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is reasonable, given the code's benign purpose.\n- **Overall:** The report's conclusion matches the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Implements retries, modifies messages with HTML links, adjusts test execution.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The HTML link injection is notable but still within the scope of a testing utility. No malicious intent or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are suitable.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is justified; no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Overall:** The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar retry logic, manipulates test results and messages.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code snippets across reports are consistent and match the described logic.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** The risk scores are low, reflecting the code's purpose as a test utility, with some minor concerns about message manipulation but nothing malicious.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports are consistent with their reasoning and the code's behavior.\n\n### My Own Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — minimal risk, mainly related to test flow manipulation, which is expected in such utilities.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a legitimate test retry extension for Robot Framework, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, given its function.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect its purpose well. No changes are necessary.",
