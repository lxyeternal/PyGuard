{
  "purpose": "Implements a retry mechanism for Robot Framework tests, managing retries based on test tags, modifying test results, messages, and output files to facilitate reruns of failed tests.",
  "sources": "Reads test tags for retry directives, accesses test objects, test results, messages, and output XML files for modification.",
  "sinks": "Modifies test execution flow, test result statuses, messages, and output XML files; updates test lists and logs.",
  "flows": "Source data from test tags and results flow into test rerun logic, message formatting, and output file updates, influencing test execution and reporting.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to parse tags and messages; insertion of HTML links into messages for navigation; no suspicious network activity or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard retry management by parsing test tags, adjusting retries, modifying test results and messages, and updating output files. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity detected. The HTML links are for report navigation, a common feature in test reporting tools. The logic is straightforward, API usage is standard, and no external data leaks or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured retry utility for Robot Framework tests. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified given its function, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
