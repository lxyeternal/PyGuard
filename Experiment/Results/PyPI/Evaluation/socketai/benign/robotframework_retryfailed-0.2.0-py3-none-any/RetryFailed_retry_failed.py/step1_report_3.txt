{
  "purpose": "This code implements a retry mechanism for Robot Framework tests, allowing automatic retries of failed tests with configurable limits and logging.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include test tags for retry configuration, test result statuses, and messages from errors. It also reads test and suite structures during report processing.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are log level adjustments, message modifications, and result modifications that influence test execution flow and reporting. No external untrusted data output or network activity is present.",
  "flows": "Input from test tags or messages affects retry logic and logging levels. Results and messages influence test rerunning and report modifications. No external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code uses standard Robot Framework APIs. The retry logic appears straightforward, with no unusual code structures or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for retrying failed tests based on tags and configurations, adjusting logging levels, and modifying test results for retries. It also manages report modifications by removing or retaining retried tests. All operations rely on standard APIs and regex patterns. No suspicious or malicious behavior, external data leaks, or obfuscation are detected. The code's purpose aligns with typical test retry functionality, with safe and expected behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate test retry utility for Robot Framework with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks. It employs common programming patterns and API usage without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
