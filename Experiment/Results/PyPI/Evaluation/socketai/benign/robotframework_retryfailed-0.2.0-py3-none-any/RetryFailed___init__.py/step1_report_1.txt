{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a part of a Python package module, primarily responsible for importing a class and setting version information.",
  "sources": "The import statement for RetryFailed, and the __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines metadata and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a license header, an import statement, and a version variable. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or system operations. The import is relative, indicating it is part of a package, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or hidden code. The license header clarifies licensing but does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package module snippet, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a simple import and metadata declaration with no suspicious or harmful content.",
