  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is minimal, consisting of license comments, a relative import, and a version string.\n- No dynamic or external data handling, no network or file operations, and no user input.\n- All reports agree that the code appears benign, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- The import is from a local module (.retry_failed), which is typical in package development.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate given the clarity of the code.\n- The security risk score is 0, as there's no evident vulnerability or malicious intent.\n\n**Confirmation of issues:**\n- The code does not contain any issues or vulnerabilities.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic.\n- The license header is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Analysis of scores:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified.\n- The risk scores are also 0, consistent with the benign assessment.\n- Confidence is 1, which is reasonable given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n- Obfuscated is 0, matching the straightforward nature.\n\n**Potential points of critique:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no adjustments needed.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the assessments are appropriate.\n- Since no issues are present, no higher scores are warranted.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign module snippet.\n- No malicious or security concern exists.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign with no security risks. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.",
