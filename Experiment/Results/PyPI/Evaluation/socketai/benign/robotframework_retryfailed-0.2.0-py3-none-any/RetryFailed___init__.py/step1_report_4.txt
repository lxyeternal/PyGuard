{
  "purpose": "Import a class from a local module and define a version string, likely part of a larger package's initialization or configuration.",
  "sources": "The local import from '.retry_failed' and the __version__ string definition.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; the code merely imports a module and sets a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license comment, an import statement, and a version string assignment. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or other behaviors that could indicate malicious intent. The import is from a local module, which is standard in package development. No external or untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up a version and imports a class from a sibling module.",
