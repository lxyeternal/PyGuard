  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal, benign module snippet.\n- The code consists solely of license comments, a relative import (`from .retry_failed import RetryFailed`), and a version string (`__version__ = \"0.2.0\"`).\n- No dynamic code, data processing, external input, or system modifications are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The import is from a local module, which is standard in package development.\n\n**Confirmation of Issues:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious constructs.\n- The import statement is from a local module, indicating internal package structure, not external or untrusted sources.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- They appropriately assign high confidence (1) and zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n- The confidence scores of 1 are justified.\n\n**Potential Risks:**\n- Since the code is purely import and metadata, the risk is negligible.\n- No reason to increase any scores.\n\n**Challenging Assumptions:**\n- The reports assume the import is from a trusted, internal module, which is standard.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are necessary or supported.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The scores across all reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated code score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a straightforward, harmless package module snippet. No security concerns or malicious behavior are evident.",
