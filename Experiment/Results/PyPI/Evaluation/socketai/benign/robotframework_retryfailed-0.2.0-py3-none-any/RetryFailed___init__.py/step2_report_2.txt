  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the provided assessments.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Contains a license header.\n- Imports `RetryFailed` from a local module `.retry_failed`.\n- Defines a `__version__` string as \"0.2.0\".\n- No other logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. It’s typical package setup code.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious patterns, data flows, or external effects. No errors are evident.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 0.5, with confidence at 1. These seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it include obfuscated or suspicious code. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports avoid speculative claims; they correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation and Final Estimation:\n\nGiven the minimal code and the thorough assessments, I agree with the provided evaluations. The code is a standard, benign module snippet with no malicious or security issues.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple import and version declaration, typical in package modules. No external data, no system modifications, no suspicious patterns. The license header is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final remarks:\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments needed. The overall assessment confirms that this code snippet is safe and poses no security threat.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and standard.",
