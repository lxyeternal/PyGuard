{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a small module that imports a class or function named RetryFailed from a local package, and sets a version string. Its primary purpose seems to be to provide retry logic functionality within a larger package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.retry_failed' and accesses the '__version__' attribute. There are no inputs from external sources such as user input, environment variables, or network.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to files, send data over the network, or invoke external commands. It simply defines a version string and imports a module internally.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing 'RetryFailed' from a local module and setting a version string. There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets (beyond the version string), or suspicious behaviors are present. The license header is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward. It only imports a local module and defines a version attribute. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or handling of untrusted data. The license header is typical for open-source projects. Overall, the code is simple and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, small component of a larger package, containing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as part of a versioning and import mechanism without exposing vulnerabilities.",
