  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a minimal, benign module that imports a class from a local submodule and sets a version string.\n- No untrusted data sinks, external network or file operations, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The license header is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.\n- The import is from a local module, which is typical in package development.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, and the confidence is high (1).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code snippet is present and correctly reflects the described structure.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malware, such as code injection, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None are apparent; the code is purely structural.\n\n### Flaws or Logical Errors:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports. The reasoning is consistent and thorough.\n- The assessments correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign description.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and transparent.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as there are no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as a simple package module with no malicious or risky elements.\n- The license header is standard and does not influence security risk.\n- The import from a local module (`.retry_failed`) is typical and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Synthesis:\nGiven the detailed review, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is straightforward, contains no external or untrusted data, and performs no harmful actions. The license and import statements are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided reports are accurate and comprehensive. No changes are necessary. The code is safe and does not pose any security threat.",
