{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple module initialization script that imports a class from a local submodule and defines a version string.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string '__version__' and imports 'RetryFailed' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets variables and imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only standard boilerplate, licensing comments, a version string, and a single import statement. No suspicious or unusual code or behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code includes license and copyright comments, a single import from a local module, and a version assignment. No user input, external data processing, or dangerous functions are used. It appears to be a typical module entry point or component definition without malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and contains no malware, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a straightforward module initialization script with no malicious behavior.",
