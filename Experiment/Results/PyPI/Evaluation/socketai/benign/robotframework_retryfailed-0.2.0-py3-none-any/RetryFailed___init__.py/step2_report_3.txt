  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe very minimal, standard package initialization code: license header, import statement from a local module, and a version string.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources, no external network or file operations, no dynamic code execution.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The import is from a local module ('.retry_failed'), which is common in package internal structure.\n- The license header is standard, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis per report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Claim:** Benign, no malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Claim:** Standard package setup, no suspicious elements.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Claim:** Typical module initialization, benign.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Claim:** Simple import and version setting, no malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Claim:** Small, benign component for retry logic, no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-checking scores:\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's content.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, which is accurate given the clear, straightforward code.\n- Confidence is 1 across all reports, justified by the simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The code is very minimal and does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n- The import from a local module is standard practice.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious logic.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the actual code content.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code snippet is a standard, benign package module component with no malicious or security concern. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
