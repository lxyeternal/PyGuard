  "purpose": "Minimal package module setup with license, import, and version declaration.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module (.retry_failed), license header, version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static import and version declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; standard package structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, benign module snippet containing only license comments, a local import, and a version string. No external input, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The import is from an internal module, typical in package development. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected. The code's simplicity and standard structure justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. All assessments are accurate and consistent; no adjustments are necessary.",
