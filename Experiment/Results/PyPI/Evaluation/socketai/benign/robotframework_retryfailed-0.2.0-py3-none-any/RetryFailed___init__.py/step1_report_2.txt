{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up package metadata, including license information, versioning, and import statements for dependencies.",
  "sources": "License comments (initial lines), import statement from a local module (.retry_failed), and version assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is mainly metadata and import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The import is from a local module, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code includes licensing information as comments, a relative import statement, and version declaration. No dynamic code execution, external data input, or potential attack vectors are present. The import from '.retry_failed' could be part of the package's internal structure but does not indicate malicious behavior. Overall, this is typical package setup code with no apparent security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package metadata and import statements with no malicious or suspicious elements. No security concerns identified.",
