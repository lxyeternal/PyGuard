  "purpose": "Utility for comparing metadata files, performing version checks, and exporting differences in JSON or CSV formats.",
  "sources": "Reads local JSON files, configuration files, and external configuration functions such as get_blob_config.",
  "sinks": "File I/O operations, JSON processing, logging, and data export functions.",
  "flows": "Reads files -> diff JSON structures -> export results; external functions may fetch remote data but not shown here.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward JSON diffing and version compatibility checks using standard libraries and external functions. No signs of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. External functions like get_blob_config could fetch remote data, but within this code, they are used for configuration management. The logic is clear, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The malware score is consistent with the absence of malicious activity, and the low security risk reflects reliance on external configs but no active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for metadata comparison with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.",
