{
  "purpose": "Defines static configuration constants, URLs, message mappings, and lists for Azure CLI change management workflows.",
  "sources": "File path constructions, static URL references, predefined lists and mappings within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; no dynamic code execution or data handling.",
  "flows": "Static data used for configuration; no runtime data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of static constants, URLs, and lists.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static configuration data, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. It imports 'os' to construct file paths based on the script location and defines various constants, URL strings, and list variables related to change management rules. There are no signs of obfuscation, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The URLs point to legitimate Azure resources, and the code does not perform any operations beyond defining constants. The absence of input handling, network activity, or code execution indicates a benign purpose. The static nature and clarity of the code justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1), mainly due to external URL references which are legitimate and read-only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No modifications are necessary.",
