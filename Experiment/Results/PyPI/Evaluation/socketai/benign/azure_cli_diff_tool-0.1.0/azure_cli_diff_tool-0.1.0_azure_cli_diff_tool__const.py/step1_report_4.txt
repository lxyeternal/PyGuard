{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define configuration constants, URLs, and message mappings related to Azure CLI change management and validation processes.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration file paths, URLs, and lists of command, parameter, and subgroup properties; no direct user input or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions, such as network connections, file writes, or command execution.",
  "flows": "The code mostly sets static constants and mappings; there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. URL and file path definitions are static and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains static configuration data: file paths, URLs, lists, and message mappings. It adheres to standard practices for defining constants and does not execute any code that could be malicious. There are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The URLs point to trusted Azure resources, and the data is used for change management messaging and validation. No dynamic code or user input processing is present that could introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It contains only static data definitions used for managing change rules and messaging within Azure CLI tools. There are no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
