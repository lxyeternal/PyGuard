{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a configuration and constants definition module for managing Azure CLI change rules, including URLs, file paths, and lists for rule handling.",
  "sources": "File system for configuration files, environment variables (via os.path and __file__), hardcoded URLs for whitelist and rule links.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink operations that process untrusted data; mainly static data definitions and file path constructions.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from sources to sinks; code mainly initializes constants and configurations.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets such as credentials, tokens, or private keys are present. The URLs and filenames seem legitimate, related to Azure CLI documentation and configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines constants, URLs, file paths, and lists used for rule management and validation processes. It imports 'os' to dynamically construct file paths based on the script location. The URLs point to Azure-related documentation and whitelist files. The lists specify rules for command and parameter modifications, likely used elsewhere in the project for validation or automation. No functions, input/output handling, or data processing is present. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activities. The code appears to be a static configuration module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration setup for managing change rules in Azure CLI, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply defines constants and configuration paths. The overall security risk is negligible.",
