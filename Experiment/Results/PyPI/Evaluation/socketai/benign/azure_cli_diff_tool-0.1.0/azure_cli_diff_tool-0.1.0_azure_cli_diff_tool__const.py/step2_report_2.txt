  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, potential issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a static configuration module, defining constants, URLs, lists, and mappings.\n- It imports `os` to construct file paths based on the script location.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or data processing is present.\n- The URLs point to Azure documentation and configuration files.\n- The lists and mappings are static and seem related to change management workflows.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or secret data.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Defines constants, URLs, lists, and mappings for Azure CLI change management.\n- Analysis: No data flow from untrusted sources, no dynamic code, no suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Benign configuration code, no malware or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- Risk: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning aligns with the code content.\n- No issues identified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Configuration constants, URLs, lists for managing change rules.\n- Analysis: Static data, no dynamic behavior, no suspicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Benign static configuration.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correctly identified as safe.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Defines configuration constants, URLs, and message mappings.\n- Analysis: Static data, no dynamic or malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe configuration module.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Defines configuration constants, URLs, message mappings.\n- Analysis: Static data, no suspicious behavior, no secrets.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2 (This is slightly higher, but still very low, possibly due to external URL references)\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The security risk score is marginally above zero, likely due to the external URL. However, the URL appears legitimate and read-only.\n- No actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Configuration constants, URLs, and message mappings.\n- Analysis: Reads local files and a remote URL, but no data processing or execution.\n- Conclusion: Standard configuration data.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.1 (very low, just noting external URL access)\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The score seems appropriate given the static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low across all reports, consistent with static configuration data.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 - 0.2 (mostly due to external URLs, but these are benign in context)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward static configuration module with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the context in which such configuration code is used. If the URLs or files were dynamically fetched or contained secrets, that would raise concern. But as presented, this code is benign.",
