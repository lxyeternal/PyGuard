  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are present, whether the reasoning is sound, and whether the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines constants, URLs, and lists related to Azure CLI change management. It uses static data, file paths, and URLs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations. No dynamic code execution or data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Presence of hardcoded URLs and static lists is typical for configuration files. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is benign, static configuration data, with high confidence (1). Malware score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. The score of malware=0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static configuration data, file paths, URLs, and lists.\n- No dynamic code, no input handling, no suspicious behavior.\n- The URLs and data are legitimate, and the code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- Confidence is high (0.9), malware=0, security risk=0.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No malware or obfuscation, and the risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- Again, static configuration constants, URLs, file paths, and lists.\n- No code execution, no dynamic data, no secrets or credentials.\n- The URLs point to Azure documentation, and the data appears benign.\n- Confidence is high (1), malware=0, security risk=0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly identified as non-malicious, configuration code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar pattern: static configuration data, message mappings, URLs, file paths.\n- No suspicious behaviors or dynamic code.\n- URLs are legitimate, no obfuscation.\n- Security risk is slightly higher (0.2), but still low, considering static data.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is consistent; no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The slightly higher security risk score might be due to external URL reliance, but overall negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- The code reads local files and sets static URLs and lists.\n- No dynamic code, no user input, no execution of untrusted data.\n- The URLs serve legitimate configuration purposes.\n- The security risk is minimal (0.1), malware=0.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, consistent with the static, readable configuration data.\n- **Risk Scores:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code. Slight variations are acceptable given the external URLs, but none suggest actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\n- The code in question is purely static configuration data, constants, URLs, and message mappings.\n- No dynamic code execution, no input handling, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- External URLs are legitimate Azure documentation or resource links.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or pose security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, static code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (negligible, mainly due to external URL reliance, but no actual risk)\n\n**Final note:** The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign configuration module with no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scoring reflects this accurately.",
