  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code content, and assess the accuracy of their conclusions and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is static configuration data, no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code contains static constants, URLs, and lists. No data flow from untrusted sources, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion and scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static configuration data.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes no dynamic code, no secrets, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly lower (0.9), but still high.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Configuration constants, URLs, and lists; no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly observes that the code is static, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — fitting.\n- **Confidence:** 1, matching the benign assessment.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines configuration constants and message mappings.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly states that the code is static, with no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2 — slightly higher risk, but still low.\n- **Justification:** The minor risk could be due to external URL references, but nothing malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reads local files and URLs, static configuration data.\n- **Assessment:** No dynamic code, no secrets, no obfuscation. External URL appears legitimate.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1 — very low.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores are 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly note no obfuscation; scores are 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the static, benign nature, scores are 0 or very close to it, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a static configuration module with no dynamic code execution, no untrusted data processing, no network activity, and no obfuscation.\n- The URLs and file paths are standard for configuration management.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are present.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.05 if considering external URL references, but negligible)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The code is benign, static configuration data with no security risks.",
