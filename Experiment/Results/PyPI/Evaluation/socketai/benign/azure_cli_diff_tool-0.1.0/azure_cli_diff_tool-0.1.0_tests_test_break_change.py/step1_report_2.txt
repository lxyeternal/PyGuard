  "purpose": "Unit testing module for Azure CLI diff tool functions, verifying parsing, diffing, and metadata handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements: importing standard libraries (unittest, os) and specific functions from azure_cli_diff_tool modules.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or operations involving untrusted data or external output are present.",
  "flows": "The code mainly performs data processing and assertions on input files; no flow from untrusted input to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code segments, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed. The code is standard test case implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a test case class with multiple test methods for various functionalities, and runs the tests if executed as main. All operations involve file path handling, function calls, and assertions. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks are present. The test data files are assumed to be safe and are used solely for validation. The code structure and logic are typical for a unit testing suite, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit testing script for a CLI diff tool, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a benign testing framework verifying functionality of external modules.",
