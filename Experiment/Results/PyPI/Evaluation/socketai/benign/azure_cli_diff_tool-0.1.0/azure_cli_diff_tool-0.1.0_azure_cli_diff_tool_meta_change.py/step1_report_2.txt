{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for representing changes or modifications in a configuration or rule set, primarily for reporting, logging, or auditing purposes.",
  "sources": "User input or external data: None explicitly read from external sources; data is passed via class constructors.",
  "sinks": "String formatting functions (get_change_rule_template, get_change_suggest_template) which could potentially process untrusted input; class attributes used for generating messages.",
  "flows": "Input data passed to class constructors flows into formatted message templates, then into class attributes, which are used for reporting or logging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. The code appears to be purely for defining change objects and generating messages.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of class definitions for representing change events, with attributes for rule IDs, messages, severity, and ignore flags. It relies on external template functions to generate messages, which are not shown here. There are no external inputs read dynamically, no network calls, file operations, or code execution. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's purpose appears to be for change tracking or auditing within a larger system, not for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, structured set of classes for change management and does not exhibit any malicious behavior. It does not contain any malicious signals, backdoors, or suspicious operations. It appears to be a standard part of a logging or auditing system with no security risks.",
