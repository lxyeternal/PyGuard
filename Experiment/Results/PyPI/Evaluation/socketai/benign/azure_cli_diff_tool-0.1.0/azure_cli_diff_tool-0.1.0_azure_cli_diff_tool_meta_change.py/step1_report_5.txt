{
  "purpose": "Define classes for representing and managing change rules, including additions, removals, and updates of command, subgroup, and parameter properties, with templates for messages and links.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions and constants from other modules; class initializers that generate messages and links based on provided parameters.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input data; the code primarily generates formatted strings and manages internal state.",
  "flows": "Initialization of change rule objects with parameters -> generation of formatted messages and URLs -> internal state updates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. Use of string concatenation for URL assembly is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes for change management, each initializing with parameters and generating template-based messages and URLs. The URLs are assembled from constants and rule IDs, which is typical for referencing change rules. Exception handling is used to enforce required parameters. No code injection, network communication, file operations, or cryptographic functions are present. Constants are imported from other modules, and their usage appears benign. The overall structure is straightforward and does not exhibit malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data classes for managing change rules with message generation; it shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The structure and logic are typical for such applications, with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
