{
  "purpose": "Define classes for representing change rules, suggestions, and metadata for configuration or API modifications.",
  "sources": "Imports from .utils and ._const modules; class initializers and methods that format template strings.",
  "sinks": "Format functions (get_change_rule_template, get_change_suggest_template) that produce strings based on input parameters; no direct data leaks or untrusted data processing identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (such as names and properties) flow into template formatting functions which generate messages; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Use of exception raising for missing parameters is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions that create structured change notifications, including rules and suggestions. The formatting relies on external template functions, which are assumed safe. No evident input handling from untrusted sources, no network activity, nor data exfiltration logic. The code follows typical design patterns for change management and does not exhibit malware characteristics. It appears to be well-structured, with proper validation for required parameters and conditional handling of ignore flags.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a structured framework for change rule representation with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks identified. The design is straightforward and does not involve any dangerous operations.",
