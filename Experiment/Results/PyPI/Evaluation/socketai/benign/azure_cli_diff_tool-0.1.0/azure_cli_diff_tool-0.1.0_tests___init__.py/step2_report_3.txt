  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports identify that the code snippets are solely license header comments with no executable code, data input/output, or data flows.\n   - **Conclusion:** There are no issues or malicious activity present in these snippets. They are purely metadata.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in stating that these are just licensing comments with no executable content.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1.0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the content.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code contains only comments, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - No need to increase the risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Analysis:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the absence of executable code or suspicious content.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the snippets as benign licensing headers.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk in licensing comments)\n\n### Additional Recommendations:\n- Since these are only licensing headers, the scores are correctly assigned.\n- If future code snippets contain actual code, a re-evaluation would be necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code snippets are benign licensing comments with no security issues. The current scoring reflects this appropriately.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0",
