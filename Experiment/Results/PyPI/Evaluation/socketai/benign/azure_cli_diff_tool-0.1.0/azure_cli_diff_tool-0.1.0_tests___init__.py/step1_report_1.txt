  "purpose": "The code appears to be a comment header containing licensing information, serving as metadata for the project.",
  "sources": "No active code or data input sources are present; only comments.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, output, or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist due to lack of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "The file contains only licensing comments with no executable code, which is unusual if expecting functional code; however, this alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet consists solely of license header comments. There are no functions, imports, or executable statements. Since this is just a header, it cannot perform any malicious activity or pose security risks. The absence of code indicates a static file intended for licensing documentation or header purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is only licensing comments with no executable code. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The file appears to be a non-functional header, possibly part of a larger source file.",
