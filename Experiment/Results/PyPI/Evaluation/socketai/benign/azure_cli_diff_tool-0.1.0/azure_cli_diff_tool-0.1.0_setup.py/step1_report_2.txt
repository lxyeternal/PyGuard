  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the azure-cli-diff-tool package, including reading version info and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from '__init__.py'; reading README.rst and HISTORY.rst files.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data output or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (version info, README, HISTORY) into variables used for setup metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard setup procedures without suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads version info from a specific file, reads documentation files, and calls setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies.",
