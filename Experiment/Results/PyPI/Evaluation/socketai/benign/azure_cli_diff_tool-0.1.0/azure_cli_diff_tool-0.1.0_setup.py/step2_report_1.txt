  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a standard Python package setup script.\n- They confirm that the script reads version info from a local file, reads documentation files, and calls `setup()` with package metadata.\n- No untrusted data flows, network activity, code injection, or obfuscation are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, with high confidence (mostly 1.0), indicating no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears correct, with no signs of errors or vulnerabilities.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; the code performs typical setup tasks.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None evident; no untrusted data handling, no secrets, no network calls.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent.\n- The reports seem consistent and accurate.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports, justified given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk:** 0, justified as the script performs standard package setup.\n\n### Justification:\n- The code is a typical setup script, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is straightforward.\n- The dependency versions are explicit but not suspicious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThere are no indications that this code poses any security threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that the actual files (`__init__.py`, `README.rst`, `HISTORY.rst`) are also free of malicious content, but based on the provided code and reports, the setup script itself is safe.",
