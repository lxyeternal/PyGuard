  "purpose": "Setup script for the azure-cli-diff-tool package, facilitating installation and dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reads the version from 'azure_cli_diff_tool/__init__.py', reads README.rst and HISTORY.rst files for descriptions.",
  "sinks": "None identified where untrusted data flows into insecure operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file, then uses that in package setup; no untrusted data flow to external commands or network.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version info from a specific file and combines documentation files for long description. It then calls setup() to prepare package installation with specified dependencies and package data. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network communications, or handling of user input that could lead to malicious activity. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply reads static files, extracts version info, and configures package metadata.",
