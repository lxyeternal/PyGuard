{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'azure-cli-diff-tool', performing package configuration and metadata definition.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__init__.py', reads README.rst and HISTORY.rst files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity, code injection, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "File reads for version and documentation, then static data passed to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward file operations and package configuration without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads version information via regex, loads documentation files, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and package data. It performs no dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. The regex usage is safe, and the overall structure is standard. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present. All signals indicate benign intent, with no signs of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are justified and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
