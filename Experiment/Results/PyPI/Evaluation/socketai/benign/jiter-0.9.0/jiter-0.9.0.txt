The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is negligible (0). The minor risk score of 0.1 in one report can be considered conservative default due to static file reads, but it does not indicate any real security concern."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data generator with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores of zero for malware and obfuscation are appropriate. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is overly cautious; a score of 0 is justified given the benign nature of the script."
