  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is negligible (0). The minor risk score of 0.1 in one report can be considered conservative default due to static file reads, but it does not indicate any real security concern."
