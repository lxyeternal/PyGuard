  "purpose": "Benchmarking different JSON parsing libraries using various large JSON data samples.",
  "sources": "Reading JSON data from predefined cases and files in the 'benches' directory.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink for untrusted data; primarily processes static data within the script.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CASES and files to JSON parsing functions via variable assignments, no external or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "None detected. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward benchmarking logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script defines large JSON data samples for benchmarking purposes. It dynamically imports multiple JSON libraries (orjson, jiter, ujson, json) and measures their performance on these samples. The code reads JSON data from embedded strings and files, then times parsing operations, printing sorted results. No external input or output of sensitive data occurs, and there are no obfuscated or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate benchmarking tool for JSON parsing libraries, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses standard Python modules and well-known open-source libraries, with no evidence of malicious intent or malware.",
