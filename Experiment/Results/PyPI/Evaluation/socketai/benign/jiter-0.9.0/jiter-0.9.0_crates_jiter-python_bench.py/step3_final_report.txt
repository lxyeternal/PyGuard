  "purpose": "Benchmark JSON parsing libraries on various datasets to measure performance.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON data from predefined constants and files in the 'benches' directory.",
  "sinks": "Data is loaded into memory and parsed; no untrusted input reaches external systems or dangerous sinks.",
  "flows": "Data is read from constants/files → passed to parsing functions → parsed data used for benchmarking.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Dynamic imports are standard in benchmarking scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs in-memory and file-based JSON parsing benchmarks using multiple libraries. It uses dynamic imports within setup functions, which is typical for such benchmarking. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The data sources are static or local files, and the code structure is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are detected. The purpose is performance measurement, not security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign benchmarking utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate safe, transparent code. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified and accurate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
