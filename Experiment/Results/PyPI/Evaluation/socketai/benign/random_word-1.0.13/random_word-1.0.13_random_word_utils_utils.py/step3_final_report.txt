  "purpose": "Utility functions for loading configuration, making HTTP requests, validating payloads, and selecting API keys securely.",
  "sources": "YAML configuration file, input parameters for payload validation, URLs and headers for HTTP requests, list of API keys for random selection.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request responses, potential exception propagation, random API key selection (used internally).",
  "flows": "Input parameters → validate payload → load API keys → select API key → make HTTP request → handle response or exception.",
  "anomalies": "Exception handling in request_url() captures and re-raises exceptions in a non-standard way but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard utility functions with proper use of libraries. No hardcoded secrets or malicious network activity are present. Exception handling is minimal but not malicious. Use of secrets.choice() is appropriate for secure random selection. External requests depend on user input but are not inherently malicious. No signs of obfuscation or backdoors. Security risk scores of 0.1-0.2 are justified given the functions, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility module for configuration management and API interactions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain risks are detected. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
