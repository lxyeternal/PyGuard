  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without reviewing the actual code content. The code might contain obfuscated parts or unusual constructs if present.",
  "analysis": "Unable to perform detailed analysis due to lack of code. Need to review the actual code to identify sources, sinks, data flows, and anomalies. Currently, only assumptions can be made based on typical patterns.",
