  "purpose": "Load a JSON database of words and select a random word from it.",
  "sources": "Reading the JSON file 'words.json' from a local directory.",
  "sinks": "Using 'secrets.choice' to select a random key from the loaded JSON data.",
  "flows": "File read -> JSON load -> 'secrets.choice' on loaded keys.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or hidden backdoors detected. Use of 'secrets' module for randomness is appropriate. No external network activity or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes by constructing a path to a JSON file in a relative directory. It then opens and loads this JSON file into 'self.valid_words'. The 'get_random_word' method returns a random key from this JSON object using 'secrets.choice'. No input/output from untrusted sources beyond reading a local file. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden malicious code. Usage of the 'secrets' module is appropriate for cryptographically secure randomness. Overall, the code seems to serve a benign purpose of selecting a random word from a local dataset.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs a simple task of loading a local JSON file and selecting a random word key securely, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
