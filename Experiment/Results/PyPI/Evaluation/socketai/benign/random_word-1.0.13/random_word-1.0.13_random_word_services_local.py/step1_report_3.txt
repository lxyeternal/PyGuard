  "purpose": "Load a JSON file containing words and provide a method to retrieve a random word using a cryptographically secure generator.",
  "sources": "Reading the JSON file from a relative path using open() and load() from the json module.",
  "sinks": "secrets.choice() selecting a random key from the loaded dictionary.",
  "flows": "File read operation loads data into self.valid_words; get_random_word() uses secrets.choice() on self.valid_words keys.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. Use of secrets for secure randomness is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a class that reads a JSON file containing words into a dictionary. It then provides a method to select a random key from this dictionary using secrets.choice(), which is suitable for cryptographic purposes. No external network access, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior detected. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to typical patterns for secure random selection from loaded data.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple, benign function of loading words from a JSON file and selecting a random word securely. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears safe and well-structured.",
