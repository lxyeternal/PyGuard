  "purpose": "Load a JSON file containing words and provide a method to select a random word from it.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'words.json' file from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Using 'secrets.choice' to select a random key from the loaded JSON data.",
  "flows": "File is read from disk into 'self.valid_words'; 'get_random_word' uses 'secrets.choice' on 'self.valid_words.keys()' to produce a random word.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code uses standard library functions for file handling and random selection.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'Local' that initializes by loading a JSON file containing words into 'self.valid_words'. The method 'get_random_word' safely chooses a random key from this dictionary using 'secrets.choice'. The code appears to be straightforward, with no suspicious data flows or malicious behaviors detected. It securely handles file reading and random selection without insecure patterns or potential for code injection or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard operation of loading data from a JSON file and selecting a random word. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided code. It appears safe and correctly implemented for its purpose.",
