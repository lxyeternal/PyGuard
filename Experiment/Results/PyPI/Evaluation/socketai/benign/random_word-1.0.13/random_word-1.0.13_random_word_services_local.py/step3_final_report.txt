  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a JSON file containing words into a dictionary and provides a method to select a random key using secrets.choice(). It uses standard libraries appropriately, with no network activity or suspicious behavior. The scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. No logical flaws or security issues are present. The minimal risk score accounts for potential local file tampering but is justified given the context. The code is simple, secure, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
