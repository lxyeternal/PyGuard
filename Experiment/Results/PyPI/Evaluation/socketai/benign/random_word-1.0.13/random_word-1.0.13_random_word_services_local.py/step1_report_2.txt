  "purpose": "Load a JSON file containing words and provide a method to return a random word from it.",
  "sources": "Reading the JSON file 'words.json' from the filesystem",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct data sinks that process untrusted input or output data",
  "flows": "File is read during class initialization; 'secrets.choice' is used to select a random key from 'valid_words'",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code reads a JSON file containing words during object instantiation. It uses 'secrets.choice' for secure random selection of a word key. No external input processing, data leaks, or malicious actions are evident. The use of 'secrets' indicates intent to ensure cryptographically secure randomness, which is benign here. The file path construction is straightforward and standard, with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to load a list of words and randomly select one. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
