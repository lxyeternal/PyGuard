  "conclusion": "The overall supply chain security assessment indicates minimal risk with no confirmed malicious activity. Slight suspicion of obfuscation in some reports warrants a marginally higher malware score (up to 0.2), but the evidence remains inconclusive. The scores across reports are consistent with their analyses, and the low malware and obfuscation scores are justified by the lack of concrete malicious patterns. Therefore, the dependency appears safe based on current information."
