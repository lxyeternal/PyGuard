  "purpose": "A simple class for generating random words using an external service.",
  "sources": "Initialization of the Local service object, call to get_random_word method.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Instantiation -> method call -> return of random word.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward class implementation. The Local class's behavior is unknown but assumed benign as it's imported from a local module.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that relies on an imported Local service to generate random words. There are no hardcoded credentials, environment variables, or external network calls visible within this code snippet. The class acts as a simple wrapper around the Local service. Since the Local class's implementation isn't provided, its security posture cannot be fully assessed; however, based solely on this code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign wrapper for a local random word generation service. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from this snippet alone.",
