  "purpose": "Wrapper class for generating random words via a local service",
  "sources": "Import of Local class from random_word.services.local, invocation of get_random_word() method",
  "sinks": "None within this snippet; potential risk depends on Local class implementation",
  "flows": "Initialization of Local instance -> calling get_random_word() -> returning the result",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward wrapper with no suspicious code or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, clear wrapper around an external Local service, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity. The trustworthiness of the Local class is external; within this snippet, no malicious behavior is evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate, considering dependency trust. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, acting as a straightforward wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score reflects reliance on an external service whose trustworthiness cannot be assessed here. Overall, the code is safe, and the provided reports and scores are consistent and appropriate.",
