  "sinks": "Return statement providing the random word",
  "flows": "Instantiation of Local service -> calling get_random_word on the service -> returning the result",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class RandomWords that initializes an instance of Local from an imported module. It provides a method to retrieve a random word from this local service. The service is imported from 'random_word.services.local', which suggests it is a local, possibly self-contained, module. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. It relies on an external local service, but nothing indicates that this service is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic wrapper around a local service for generating random words. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. The code is simple and appears safe.",
