{
  "purpose": "A decorator class for retrying function execution upon exception, with configurable retry attempts and delay.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data; it is purely a function wrapper.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code simply retries a function call based on exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The class provides a retry mechanism for functions, catching exceptions and retrying after a delay. It uses standard Python features and the 'time' module for sleeping. No hardcoded secrets, no data leakage, no network activity, and no code injection vulnerabilities are present. The implementation is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard retry decorator with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
