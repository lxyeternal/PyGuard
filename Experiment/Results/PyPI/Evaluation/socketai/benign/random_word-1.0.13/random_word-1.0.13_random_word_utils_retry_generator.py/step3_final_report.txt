{
  "purpose": "A retry decorator class that attempts to execute a function multiple times upon exception, with configurable retries and delay.",
  "sources": "The function being decorated, invoked within the __call__ method, and exceptions caught during execution.",
  "sinks": "The exception message printed via print() in case of failure; no external data sinks or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Function execution -> exception caught -> message printed -> delay -> retry, repeated until success or retries exhausted.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print() for exception logging; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard retry pattern using a class decorator. It catches all exceptions, logs them via print, and retries after a delay. No suspicious behaviors, external data handling, or malicious activities are present. The code is straightforward, uses common Python constructs, and does not contain obfuscation or security vulnerabilities. The use of print() for logging is not ideal but benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward retry decorator with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring appropriately reflects the low security concern. Minor improvements could include replacing print() with proper logging, but this does not impact security.",
