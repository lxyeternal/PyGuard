  "purpose": "A retry decorator that retries a function call a specified number of times with optional delay between retries.",
  "sources": "Input parameters of the decorated function (f), tries, delay, and exception handling within the retry logic.",
  "sinks": "Output of the decorated function, standard output for exception messages.",
  "flows": "Function call (f) -> exception handling -> retries with delay -> final exception raised if all retries fail.",
  "anomalies": "Uses print statement for exception messages, which is benign; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Retry class that implements a retry mechanism for functions. It takes number of tries and delay as parameters. The __call__ method wraps the target function with a try-except loop that retries on exception, printing error messages and sleeping between retries. No external data sources, no sensitive data handling, no network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The logic is straightforward and standard for retry decorators.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard retry mechanism without malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign utility function suitable for handling transient errors. No signs of malware or malicious intent are present.",
