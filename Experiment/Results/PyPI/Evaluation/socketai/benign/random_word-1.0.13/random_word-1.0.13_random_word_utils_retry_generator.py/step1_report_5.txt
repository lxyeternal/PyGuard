{
  "purpose": "A retry decorator class that retries a function upon exception with optional delay",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code does not read input or data",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output to external systems; only prints exception messages to stdout",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; retry logic is internal and straightforward",
  "anomalies": "Uses print statement for exception reporting instead of logging; no other unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Retry class as a decorator for retrying functions upon exception. It initializes with the number of tries and optional delay, then wraps the target function. When called, it attempts to execute the function, catching exceptions, printing them, and sleeping before retrying. If all retries fail, it raises the last exception. No external inputs, data leaks, or malicious activities are evident. The print statement could be considered suboptimal, but it is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard retry decorator with no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no external communication. It is likely benign and used for reliability in function execution.",
