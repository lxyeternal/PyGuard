  "purpose": "A decorator class to retry execution of a function upon exception with optional delay between retries.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; uses function arguments when called.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data leakage or malicious output.",
  "flows": "Function execution flow with retry attempts upon exceptions; no external data flow outside function parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Simple retry logic; no suspicious or malicious code behavior. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Retry class that decorates functions to retry execution upon exceptions. It catches general exceptions, logs them with a print statement, and retries with optional delay. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection. The use of print for logging exception info is not suspicious. No external inputs or outputs are handled insecurely.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard retry decorator without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The logic is simple and intended for reliable function execution.",
