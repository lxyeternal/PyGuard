  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external API key management practices, which are standard. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.15, justified by the external dependencies and network interactions. No modifications are necessary; the code appears safe for use."
