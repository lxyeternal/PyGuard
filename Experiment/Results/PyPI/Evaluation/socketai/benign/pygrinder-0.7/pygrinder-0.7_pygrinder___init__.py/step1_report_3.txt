{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python toolkit for generating missing data patterns in datasets for simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions and variables from relative modules and variables such as __version__; these are primarily from local package files.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that handle untrusted data, external inputs, or that perform potentially dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "There are no evident source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; the code mainly defines imports and exports functions and variables for package use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. All imported modules appear to be local package modules, and no dynamic code execution or external network calls are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package module, importing various functions related to missing data generation and manipulation from local files, and defining __all__ for exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data leakage, or hidden backdoors. It contains no network operations, system modifications, or sensitive data handling beyond basic function imports. The structure and content suggest typical package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured Python package module designed for data simulation tasks. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
