{
  "purpose": "This code provides a toolkit for simulating missing data patterns in datasets, likely for data analysis or machine learning experiments.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the same package: block_missing, mar_logistic, mcar, mcar_little_test, mnar_x, mnar_t, mnar_nonuniform, rdo, seq_missing, and utility functions from utils.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling observed. No network communication, file operations, or environment variable access present.",
  "flows": "The package imports various functions but does not process or transfer untrusted data within this code snippet. The flow is limited to internal module references and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or external communications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines package metadata, imports functions from internal modules, and exposes them via __all__. There are no input handling, data processing, or output mechanisms in this snippet. All components appear standard and consistent with a data simulation toolkit. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign, well-structured data simulation library for missing data patterns. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
