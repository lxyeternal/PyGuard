{
  "purpose": "A Python toolkit for simulating missing data in datasets, primarily used for data analysis and testing missing data handling methods.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and functions from local package files (.block_missing, .missing_at_random, etc.) and accesses package version information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules, no data flow from external sources or untrusted input to sensitive functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of imports, a license, comments, and an explicit list of public symbols.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package __init__.py file that imports various modules related to missing data simulation. There are no data processing, input handling, or potentially dangerous operations. The package does not contain any code that could be exploited maliciously or leak data. It adheres to typical package structure with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves to organize and expose modules for a data simulation toolkit. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.",
