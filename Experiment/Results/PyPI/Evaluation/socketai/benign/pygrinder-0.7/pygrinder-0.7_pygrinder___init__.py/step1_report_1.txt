  "purpose": "To provide a Python toolkit for simulating missing data in datasets, supporting various missingness patterns.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules (.block_missing, .missing_at_random, etc.) and metadata (__version__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input, or external data sources involved in the code.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code is primarily module imports and definitions with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns observed. The email address appears normal and relates to the author's contact information.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements importing various functions from internal modules, and an __all__ list defining exported symbols. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or credential handling. The comments and metadata are benign, serving documentation and licensing purposes. No malicious or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python module for data simulation, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It is a clean, well-structured package setup without security concerns.",
