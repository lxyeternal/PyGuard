  "purpose": "Functions to create artificial missing data sequences in time-series datasets for data augmentation or testing robustness.",
  "sources": "Data input arrays or tensors, reading shape information and parameters for masking.",
  "sinks": "Modified data with slices set to NaN, representing missing data sequences.",
  "flows": "Select start indices randomly, then set slices of data to NaN based on sequence length and indices.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no external communication, no obfuscation; use of np.nan is standard for masking.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data masking for missing data simulation, with input validation, cloning to prevent side effects, and random selection of start points. It handles both numpy arrays and torch tensors correctly, applying NaN masking to create missing sequences. No malicious or sabotage behavior is evident; the operations are typical for data augmentation tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility for generating missing data sequences in time-series datasets. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
