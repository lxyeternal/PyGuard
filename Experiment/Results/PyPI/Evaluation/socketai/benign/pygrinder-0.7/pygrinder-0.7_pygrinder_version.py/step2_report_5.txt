  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observation:**\nAll reports consistently identify the code as a minimal, benign module containing only comments and a single version string assignment. There are no signs of dynamic code, input/output handling, network operations, or any suspicious patterns. The scores assigned—particularly malware, obfuscated, and security risk—are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The only actual code is `__version__ = \"0.7\"` and comments.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation observed.\n- **Security risks:** None evident.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as there's no executable logic.\n\n### Critical points:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The reasoning is sound; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond what is evident.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Since the code is purely static metadata, no changes to scores or reasoning are necessary.\n- The high confidence (1) is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is benign, and the current scores and reasoning are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. No modifications needed. The code is a simple, safe version declaration with no security concerns.",
