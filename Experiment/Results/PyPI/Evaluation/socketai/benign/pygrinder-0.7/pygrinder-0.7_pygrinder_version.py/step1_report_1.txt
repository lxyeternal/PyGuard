{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define version information and licensing details for a project named PyGrinder, likely serving as metadata or documentation.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the hardcoded version string '__version__' and comments containing project metadata.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted input or data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present since the code only contains static variable assignments and comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and contains only comments and a version variable.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of comments and a single variable assignment indicating the project version. There are no dynamic inputs, no data processing, and no external interactions. It appears to serve as part of a package's metadata or documentation rather than executable logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as documentation or metadata for the PyGrinder project. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
