  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal version declaration and metadata for a Python package, containing only comments and a static version string.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ = \"0.7\"",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment of version string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is purely static with comments and a version string",
  "analysis": "The code contains only comments and a single static variable assignment (__version__ = \"0.7\"). There are no functions, input/output operations, dynamic code, or external data handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code is typical for package metadata, with no suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and accurate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
