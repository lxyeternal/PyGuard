  "purpose": "Re-exports the 'seq_missing' function from a local module for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Imports 'seq_missing' from a relative module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "Import of 'seq_missing' to be used within the package; no data flow outside standard module structure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation detected. The file contains only standard module re-export code with an author comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that re-exports 'seq_missing' from a local module. It includes an author comment with an email and a license declaration. There are no dynamic code execution, data handling, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for a Python package's module initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard module re-export file with no malicious intent or security issues.",
