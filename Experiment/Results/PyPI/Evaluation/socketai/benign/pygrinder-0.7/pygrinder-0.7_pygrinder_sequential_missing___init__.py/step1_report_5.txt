{
  "purpose": "This module appears to serve as an initializer or importer that exposes the 'seq_missing' function or class from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module '.seq_missing'",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data transfer observed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports 'seq_missing' from a relative module and defines '__all__' for export. It includes author and license comments, which are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. There are no hidden code, dynamic execution, or data handling mechanisms that could be malicious. The structure and content are typical for a module initializer.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple interface for exporting 'seq_missing'. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
