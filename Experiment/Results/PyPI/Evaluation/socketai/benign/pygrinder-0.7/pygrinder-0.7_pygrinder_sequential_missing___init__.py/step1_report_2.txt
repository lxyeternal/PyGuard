{
  "purpose": "Re-exports the 'seq_missing' function from a local module, likely for use in other parts of the package.",
  "sources": "Imports 'seq_missing' from a local module in the same package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input or sensitive data; the code only performs a static import and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of an import statement and an __all__ declaration for module exports. It appears to be a simple package component designed to expose 'seq_missing'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues. The license information is standard, and the code does not perform any runtime operations beyond import and export declarations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module interface with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a standard, minimal module setup.",
