  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "Import from local module to __all__ export",
  "anomalies": "None",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports 'seq_missing' from a relative module and sets __all__ to expose it. It contains no runtime logic, data flows involving untrusted sources, or suspicious patterns. The code is standard for package initialization and contains no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a straightforward module initializer with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No modifications are necessary.",
