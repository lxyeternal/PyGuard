  "purpose": "Module initialization that exports the 'seq_missing' function or class from the local package.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'seq_missing' component from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Imports 'seq_missing' and makes it available publicly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module initializer that imports a specific component ('seq_missing') from a relative module and sets it as part of the module's public interface. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or complex logic. It appears to be standard package setup code with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard Python module initializer. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
