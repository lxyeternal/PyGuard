  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a single import statement and an __all__ declaration. It appears to be a standard module setup exposing 'seq_missing'. No input, no output, and no suspicious code logic or behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that exposes a function from a local package. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward and appears safe.",
