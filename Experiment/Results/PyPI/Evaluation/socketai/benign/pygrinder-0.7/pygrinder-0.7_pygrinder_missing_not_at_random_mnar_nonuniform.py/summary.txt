  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for simulating MNAR missing data patterns, with no malicious intent or behavior. It employs standard probabilistic masking techniques, with adjustable probabilities based on feature observation counts. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The overall security assessment is that it is safe for use in data augmentation or testing environments."
