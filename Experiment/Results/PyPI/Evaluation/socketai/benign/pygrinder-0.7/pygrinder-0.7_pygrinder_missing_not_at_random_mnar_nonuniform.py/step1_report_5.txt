  "purpose": "This code introduces missing data in numerical datasets based on a non-uniform, MNAR (Missing Not at Random) pattern, adjusting missingness probabilities based on feature observation counts.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data `X` (np.ndarray or torch.Tensor) and observation counts derived from data (via np.sum or torch.sum on non-NaN entries). It also reads the probability parameter `p` and optional pre-defined probabilities.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is where the code assigns np.nan or torch.nan to data points, effectively corrupting the data by masking values. This occurs in random locations determined by the generated random matrices compared with feature-specific probabilities.",
  "flows": "Data `X` (source) flows into the functions, where observation counts are computed (source). Based on these counts, adjusted probabilities are computed (source to adjustment). Then, random matrices determine which data points are masked (source to sink), resulting in corrupted data with missing values.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious code anomalies such as hidden backdoors, code injection, or malicious network activity. The code includes commented-out sections that could be confused as obfuscation but are standard for debugging or alternative implementation notes. The code appears structured for a legitimate purpose of data masking for MNAR simulation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to simulate MNAR missing data by probabilistically masking data points based on feature observation counts, with adjustments to probabilities based on relative observation frequencies. It supports both numpy and torch tensors, ensuring flexibility. The process involves calculating feature-specific replacement probabilities, iteratively adjusting them to match a target overall masking rate, and then randomly masking data points. No embedded network activity, system calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The commented lines and the structure suggest standard data corruption routines without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended for data augmentation or simulation of missing data scenarios, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It systematically masks data points based on observed feature counts, which aligns with its described purpose. There are no hidden backdoors or malicious operations detected. Overall, the code appears benign and safe for its intended use.",
