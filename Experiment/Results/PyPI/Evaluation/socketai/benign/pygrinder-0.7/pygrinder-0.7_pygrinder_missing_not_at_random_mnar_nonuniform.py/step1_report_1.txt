{
  "purpose": "The code simulates missing data patterns in numerical datasets using a non-uniform, MNAR (missing not at random) mechanism, adjusting missingness probabilities based on feature observation counts.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays (X) from user or external source, either as numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor, and parameters p, pre_replacement_probabilities, increase_factor.",
  "sinks": "Modification of input data arrays by setting certain values to np.nan or torch.nan based on computed probabilities, altering the original datasets.",
  "flows": "Data is read from input arrays, observation counts are computed, probabilities are adjusted, random matrices determine which data points to mask, and then data points are set to missing (nan), following source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains commented-out code for alternative masking strategies; however, there are no clear anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious functions. The use of randomness and probability adjustments appears consistent with intended data corruption rather than malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is to simulate missing data in datasets based on feature observation counts. It computes replacement probabilities, adjusting them iteratively to match a target missingness level, and applies masking through random sampling. The implementation is clear, with proper parameter checks and handling of both numpy and torch data types. No suspicious code, network connections, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are present. The only potentially concerning aspect is the intentional data modification, but it aligns with the documented purpose of data corruption for testing or simulation, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a data simulation utility designed for testing missing data scenarios. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The code’s structure and comments suggest it is for research or data augmentation purposes. No security threats are evident, and it appears safe for use within its intended scope.",
