{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to simulate missing data in numerical datasets using a MNAR (Missing Not at Random) pattern, adjusting probabilities based on feature observation counts to create realistic missing data scenarios for testing or modeling.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays or tensors (X), which are read in functions _mnar_nonuniform_numpy and _mnar_nonuniform_torch; observation counts are computed from the data; input parameters p and pre_replacement_probabilities influence the masking process.",
  "sinks": "Modified data arrays or tensors where certain values are replaced with np.nan or torch.nan, effectively 'masking' data points based on computed or provided probabilities.",
  "flows": "Data is input to the main function mnar_nonuniform, which directs to either numpy or torch-specific masking functions based on data type; within these functions, replacement probabilities are calculated or reused; random matrices generate masks that overwrite data points with NaN, creating missingness according to adjusted probabilities.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a loop that iteratively adjusts replacement probabilities to match a target total missing count, which, while complex, appears legitimate; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual dynamic code execution is present. The code relies on standard libraries and normal probabilistic operations; no obfuscation or suspicious language features are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for creating MNAR missing data patterns based on observation counts, adjusting masking probabilities to reflect feature observation frequency. It clones data to avoid side effects, calculates feature observation counts, adjusts probabilities via a scaling function, and iteratively calibrates total missing count to match a target. The process involves standard numpy and torch operations with random number generation for stochastic masking. No indicators of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system manipulation, are observed. The functions are typical for data augmentation or testing scenarios, with transparent and well-documented logic. The potential for misuse exists if an attacker intentionally misreports or manipulates data or probabilities, but there is no direct malicious code or external communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate task of simulating MNAR missing data patterns with adjustable parameters. It contains no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or harmful behavior. The logic is straightforward, focusing on probabilistic data masking based on feature observation counts. Overall, it appears safe and intended for data augmentation or testing purposes.",
