{
  "purpose": "The code introduces missing values into numerical datasets based on a non-uniform, MNAR (Missing Not At Random) pattern, adjusting probabilities based on feature observation counts.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays (np.ndarray or torch.Tensor), input parameters for probabilities, and internal counts of observed values.",
  "sinks": "Modifies the input data arrays in-place by setting certain values to np.nan or torch.nan based on computed probabilities.",
  "flows": "Calculates observation counts -> adjusts feature-specific probabilities -> generates random matrices -> masks data points with probabilities -> outputs corrupted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of random masking is standard for MNAR simulation. No suspicious network activity or file access observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs statistical adjustment and data masking to simulate MNAR missingness patterns. It uses standard numpy and torch functions to compute feature observation counts and adapt masking probabilities accordingly. The adjustment functions are straightforward, scaling probabilities based on observed counts relative to averages. The masking process is based on random matrices, which is typical for such simulations. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, such as network calls, data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden routines. The code appears well-structured for its intended purpose, with input validation and safe operations. No suspicious or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation designed to simulate missing data patterns based on feature observation frequencies. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. The code is consistent with data augmentation or simulation tasks for machine learning datasets.",
