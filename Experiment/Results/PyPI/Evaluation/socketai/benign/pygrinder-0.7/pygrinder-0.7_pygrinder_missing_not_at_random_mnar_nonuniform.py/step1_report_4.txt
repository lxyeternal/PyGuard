{
  "purpose": "The code aims to simulate missing data patterns in numerical datasets using MNAR (Missing Not At Random) mechanisms, with functions for both NumPy and PyTorch implementations, to introduce missingness based on feature observation counts and probabilities.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays or tensors (X), which can be numpy.ndarray, torch.Tensor, or list (converted to numpy.ndarray). Read occurs when copying data and when calculating observation counts, as well as during random number generation for masking.",
  "sinks": "Modification of the input data by setting selected elements to np.nan or torch.nan based on computed probabilities, potentially leading to data loss or corruption. Also, random number generation (np.random.rand, torch.rand) influences masking behavior.",
  "flows": "Observation counts are computed from the input data, used to adjust feature-specific replacement probabilities. Random matrices are generated to decide which data points to mask. Based on comparisons, data points are set to nan, creating missing patterns.",
  "anomalies": "Use of iterative adjustment for total replacement probability, which might be computationally intensive but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code behaviors. The presence of commented-out lines suggests flexibility in masking approach, but nothing suspicious in behavior. No obfuscated code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured to generate MNAR missingness patterns by adjusting feature-specific missing probabilities based on the observed data counts. It includes both numpy and torch implementations with similar logic. The probability adjustments are based on observation frequencies and an increase factor. The code includes assertions to prevent invalid probability values and ensures data is copied before modifications. No external network calls, file I/O, or data exfiltration routines are present. The functions are self-contained and focused on data masking for simulation purposes, without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of data corruption for missing data simulation using MNAR mechanisms. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware features are detected. The observed patterns are consistent with data augmentation or testing tools, not malicious sabotage.",
