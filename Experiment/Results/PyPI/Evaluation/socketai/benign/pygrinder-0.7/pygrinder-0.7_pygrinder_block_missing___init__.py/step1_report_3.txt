  "purpose": "This code serves as an import module that exposes the 'block_missing' function or class for external use.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output functions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward Python module with minimal content. It imports a local module and defines an export list. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and standard. It imports a single item from a relative module and specifies what to export. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues. The structure follows common Python package conventions. No external data sources or sinks are present, reducing risk. The code contains only basic import statements and an export list.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard module boilerplate with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It is a typical module setup in a Python package.",
