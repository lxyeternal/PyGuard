  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a very simple Python module that imports a function or class `block_missing` from a local module and exposes it via `__all__`.\n- No external inputs, outputs, or data flows are present.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is straightforward, minimal, and follows common Python module conventions.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly 0, with one report at 0.1), which seems reasonable given the simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain any malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- The import statement is from a local module, which is standard.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are present.\n- The reasoning in all reports is consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n\n### Scores review:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, which is acceptable considering the minimal code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct because the code is benign.\n- Any higher score would be unjustified.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent based solely on the import statement.\n- They recognize the code as a benign module setup.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The detailed reasoning supports the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThis code is a simple, benign module that re-exports a local function or class. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe and standard.  \n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.  \n- No changes needed.  \n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code.",
