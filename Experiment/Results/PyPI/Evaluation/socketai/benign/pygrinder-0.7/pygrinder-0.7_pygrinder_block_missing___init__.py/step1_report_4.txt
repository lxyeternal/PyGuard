  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports and exposes a single function or class 'block_missing' for external use.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading occurs within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where data is written or transmitted based on this code alone.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data processing is present in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement and a module export list, which is a common pattern in Python modules. There is no evidence of data processing, external communication, or suspicious code. The imported module 'block_missing' could be benign or malicious, but the provided code only references it. No obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious behavior is apparent here.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward Python module setup without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this fragment.",
