{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define an __all__ list for module exports and imports a single function or class from a local module named block_missing.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard, with no suspicious or unusual patterns; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module with a license comment, an import statement, and an __all__ declaration. It does not contain any complex logic, dynamic code execution, or external communications. The license and author information are standard, and the import appears to be from a relative module. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages module exports and imports a local component.",
