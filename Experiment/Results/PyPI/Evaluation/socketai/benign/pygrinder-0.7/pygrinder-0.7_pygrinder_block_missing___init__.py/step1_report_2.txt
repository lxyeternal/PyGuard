  "purpose": "Re-exports the 'block_missing' function from a local module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'block_missing' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports a specific function from a local module and defines the public API. There are no inputs, outputs, or complex behaviors. The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modification. Its structure is typical for a module that consolidates exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module that exposes 'block_missing'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns indicate it is safe.",
