  "purpose": "A minimal Python module that imports 'block_missing' from a local module and exposes it via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .block_missing",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or external communication",
  "flows": "Import of 'block_missing' without execution or data flow; no source-to-sink data paths",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with only an import and __all__ declaration",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup, importing a local component and exposing it. No external inputs, outputs, or complex logic are present. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The import is from a local module, and there is no execution of imported code, network activity, or data manipulation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of this minimal code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary based solely on this snippet.",
