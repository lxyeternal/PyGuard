  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes or functions from local files and exposes them for external use via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local modules (.mnar_t, .mnar_x, .mnar_nonuniform) and metadata such as the author's email and license comments.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input or perform actions with external effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply imports and exposes internal components.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The author's email and license comments are standard metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward Python module that imports components from local modules and defines __all__ for export. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of untrusted data. The only noteworthy information is the author's contact email, which is not suspicious. The code does not contain any malware indicators or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply imports and exports components, with no evidence of supply chain attack vectors or malicious intent.",
