{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing internal modules and defining exports for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads static module imports: mnar_t, mnar_x, mnar_nonuniform.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communications.",
  "flows": "The code imports internal modules without data flow from untrusted sources; no runtime data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports internal submodules and defines __all__ for exports. It contains author metadata and license comments, but no dynamic operations, external data handling, or obfuscation. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code does not perform any malicious actions or security vulnerabilities. The consistency across reports and the simplicity of the code support a conclusion of no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
