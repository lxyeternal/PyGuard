{
  "purpose": "This code module imports specific functions or classes from relative submodules and defines an export list, likely for a package related to statistical or data processing functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module files 'mnar_t', 'mnar_x', and 'mnar_nonuniform' via relative imports.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs, network communications, or data leaks; the code does not handle external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "The module imports functions/classes from internal submodules and exposes them via __all__, with no data flow to or from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, obfuscated code, or unusual logic. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a simple __init__.py file for a package, aggregating and exporting specific submodules. It includes author metadata and license information, which is standard and does not suggest malicious intent. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data manipulations. The structure and content are typical for a Python package initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package initialization script that correctly imports and exports internal modules. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected. The overall security risk is very low.",
