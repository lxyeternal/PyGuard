{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to import specific modules and define an export list for a Python package, likely related to data or statistical processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module files 'mnar_t', 'mnar_x', and 'mnar_nonuniform' via relative imports.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leakage or system compromise.",
  "flows": "The source modules are imported and then included in the '__all__' list, which controls what is exported when the package is imported elsewhere. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present. The code follows standard import and export conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module defining import statements for three submodules and specifying exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no handling of external or untrusted data, and no suspicious operations. The file appears to be part of a larger package, with no embedded or hidden malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. It serves a standard purpose of organizing module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to organize module imports and exports. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a typical package module initializer.",
