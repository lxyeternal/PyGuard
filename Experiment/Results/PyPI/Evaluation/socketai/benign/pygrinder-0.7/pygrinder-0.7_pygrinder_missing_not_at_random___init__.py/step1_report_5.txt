{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package that imports specific modules related to 'mnar' and defines their exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from module imports (.mnar_t, .mnar_x, .mnar_nonuniform) and the __all__ declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import statements and metadata comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements for internal modules and an __all__ list to specify public API components. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are referenced. There are no dynamic executions, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious operations. The initial comments specify author and license, which are standard. Overall, the code is simple, structured, and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily serves as an interface for other parts of the package, with no malicious activity evident.",
