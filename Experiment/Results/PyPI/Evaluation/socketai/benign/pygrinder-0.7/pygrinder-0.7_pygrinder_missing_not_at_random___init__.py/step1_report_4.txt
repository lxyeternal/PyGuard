{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports specific components (mnar_t, mnar_x, mnar_nonuniform) from local submodules and exports them for external use, likely as part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.mnar_t, .mnar_x, .mnar_nonuniform)",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data handling, network communication, or sensitive operations present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs static imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard in structure",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module initializer that imports specific functions or classes from local submodules and defines the public interface with __all__. There are no input/output operations, no use of environment variables, no network activity, and no sensitive data handling. The code is minimal, standard, and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard in structure, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical Python module initialization script with no signs of malware or security concerns.",
