{
  "purpose": "The code simulates missing data patterns in datasets using MNAR (missing not at random) mechanisms, specifically based on temporal dynamics.",
  "sources": "Input data in the form of numpy.ndarray, torch.Tensor, or list (converted to numpy array). The data is read when passed into the functions and cloned internally.",
  "sinks": "Modified data with missing values assigned as NaN, returned as the same data type. No external data transmission or output beyond function return.",
  "flows": "Input data → cloning and mask creation → calculation of missingness mask based on intensity functions → modification of data to insert NaNs → return of corrupted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of numpy.random.rand and torch.randn for generating random masks; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated or misleading code, all functions are straightforward. No network calls, file access, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to artificially introduce missing data based on a temporal intensity function, which depends on sinusoidal and exponential calculations. It utilizes standard libraries (numpy, torch) for computations. Data is carefully copied to prevent unintended side effects. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The random number generators are used for mask creation, consistent with normal stochastic processes. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns, and adheres to standard practices. There are no indications of obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose is to generate MNAR missing data patterns for testing or simulation purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. It performs legitimate data manipulation using common scientific computing libraries. The overall security risk is negligible.",
