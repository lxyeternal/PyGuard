{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to artificially introduce missing values into numerical data, following a Missing Not At Random (MNAR) pattern influenced by temporal or intensity functions.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are the variables X (np.ndarray or torch.Tensor) supplied to the mnar_t function, which are then processed internally in _mnar_t_numpy or _mnar_t_torch.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the input data by setting certain values to np.nan or torch.nan, based on generated masks, without external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data X is copied and processed in either numpy or torch versions; a mask based on intensity functions determines which data points are set to missing, with missingness influenced by random values and the intensity function, and then the data with missing values is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscated code or unusual language features. It performs intentional data manipulation without hidden or suspicious logic. No hardcoded credentials, external calls, or data exfiltration methods are present.",
  "analysis": "The functions generate missing data masks based on sinusoidal intensity functions modulated by random values scaled by 'scale'. Data is copied at the start to prevent side effects. The process involves standard numpy and torch operations; no external network calls, file I/O, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The purpose aligns with data augmentation or simulation, not malicious activity. The code is well-structured and contains no signs of obfuscation or malware. The use of mathematical functions and random number generation appears legitimate for the intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed solely for generating missing data patterns in numerical datasets, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a legitimate data processing utility intended for research or data augmentation tasks.",
