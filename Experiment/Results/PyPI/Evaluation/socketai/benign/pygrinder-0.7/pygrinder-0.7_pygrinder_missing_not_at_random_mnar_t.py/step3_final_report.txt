{
  "purpose": "The code generates MNAR (Missing Not At Random) missing data patterns based on sinusoidal intensity functions, simulating temporal missingness in datasets.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from variable X, which can be a numpy.ndarray, torch.Tensor, or list (converted to numpy array).",
  "sinks": "Modifies the input data in-place by setting certain entries to NaN based on computed masks, without external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Data is cloned to avoid in-place modifications, masks are computed using sinusoidal functions, and missing values are introduced by setting selected entries to NaN.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or external communication detected. Uses standard numpy and torch functions; no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data manipulation to simulate MNAR missingness based on temporal sinusoidal intensity functions. It clones input data to prevent side effects, computes masks using standard random and mathematical functions, and applies missingness accordingly. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or external data leaks are present. The functions are well-documented and utilize common scientific libraries, indicating benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for simulating MNAR missing data patterns. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential misuse with sensitive data, but the code itself is safe.",
