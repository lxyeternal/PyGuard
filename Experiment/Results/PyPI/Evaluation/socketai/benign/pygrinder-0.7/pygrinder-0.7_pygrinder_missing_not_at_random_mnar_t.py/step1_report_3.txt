{
  "purpose": "The code introduces functions to corrupt data by adding missing values following an MNAR (missing not at random) pattern, primarily for data simulation or testing missing data handling methods.",
  "sources": "Input data X, which can be a list, numpy.ndarray, or torch.Tensor; data is read at the start of each function and during the shape extraction.",
  "sinks": "The functions modify the input data in-place by setting certain values to NaN based on calculated masks, but do not send data externally or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input to copying (if numpy or torch), then through calculations of masks based on temporal intensity functions, and finally values are set to NaN at the identified mask locations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code uses mathematical functions to generate missing data patterns, which is standard for data simulation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two core functions for data corruption using MNAR patterns: one for numpy arrays (_mnar_t_numpy) and one for torch tensors (_mnar_t_torch). Both functions create masks based on a sinusoidal intensity function and randomly generated values, then set data points to NaN accordingly. The main interface (mnar_t) handles different input types and delegates to the appropriate internal function. No network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be designed solely for data manipulation, with clear parameters controlling the missing data pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data simulation utility for generating MNAR missing patterns in datasets. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. No signs of malware, backdoors, or suspicious activity are detected.",
