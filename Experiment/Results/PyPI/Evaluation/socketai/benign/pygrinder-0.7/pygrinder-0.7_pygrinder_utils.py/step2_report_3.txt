  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically, considering the code's behavior, the scoring, and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for missing data handling, no malicious code, standard operations.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified, as no security issues are present.\n- **Assessment:** The functions perform standard data preprocessing tasks. No suspicious behavior, external data leaks, or malicious logic are detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard data handling utilities, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Assessment:** The code operates solely in-memory, with no external system interactions or malicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Data handling functions with minimal security risk, no malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — suitable.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — still low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Assessment:** The functions are standard utilities. The slight security risk score might be a conservative buffer for potential misuse, but given the code's nature, it's acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard missing data utilities, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no external calls or suspicious logic.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard data handling functions.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports describe functions that perform common data preprocessing tasks: calculating missing data rates, filling missing values, generating masks. These are standard in data science workflows.\n- **Potential Malicious Activity:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or external data leaks. The functions do not perform network operations, execute code, or access external systems.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear, well-structured, and documented.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All scores align with the code's behavior and the reports' summaries.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — the code is safe, with no security threats.\n\n**Note:** Given the nature of the code, these scores are appropriate. If any suspicion arises from external context, it is not supported by the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a set of standard, safe data preprocessing utilities with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided scores are accurate and justified.",
