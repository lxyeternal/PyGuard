{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling missing data in datasets, including calculating missing rates, filling missing values, and creating masks, primarily for data preprocessing in machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from variables such as X, mask, and their respective types (np.ndarray, torch.Tensor, pd.DataFrame, list). Uses functions like np.isnan, pd.isna, torch.isnan, torch.nan_to_num to process data.",
  "sinks": "Returns processed data and masks; no direct data leaks or external data transmissions are observed. No external network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Inputs (X, mask) are processed locally; missing data detection via isNaN or isna functions; missing values are filled with specified 'nan' or 'val' parameters; masks are generated and returned alongside processed data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The functions perform standard data preprocessing tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions to calculate missing data rates, fill missing values, and generate masks for datasets in numpy and torch formats. It includes input validation and type assertions to ensure data integrity. No external system interactions, network communications, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The functions operate solely on in-memory data, performing standard operations such as NaN detection, replacement, and mask creation. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious logic identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard data preprocessing utilities for handling missing data, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. It is designed for safe use in data workflows and does not include any harmful or malicious behavior.",
