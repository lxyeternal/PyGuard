{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for data preprocessing, specifically handling missing data in numpy arrays, torch tensors, and pandas DataFrames, including calculating missing rates and filling missing values with masks.",
  "sources": "The functions read input data from function parameters: 'X' (which can be list, numpy array, torch tensor, or pandas DataFrame), and 'mask' (boolean or numeric). Also, 'nan' values are used internally when filling missing data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is sent to external systems, network, or file systems. The code primarily manipulates in-memory data structures without side-effects or external calls.",
  "flows": "Input data (from parameters) is processed to calculate missing rates or fill missing values, with masks generated for missing data. No external data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard and consistent for data preprocessing tasks. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior is evident. No obfuscated code or misleading variable usage is present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements common data handling functions: calculating missing data rate across different data types, filling missing values, and creating masks. It uses assertions to ensure matching shapes and types. There are no external system calls, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All functions operate on in-memory data, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or malware. The only notable point is the replacement of NaNs with a specified fill value, which is typical for data imputation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of data preprocessing utilities without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any backdoors, data leaks, or malicious external interactions. It is safe and intended solely for data handling purposes.",
