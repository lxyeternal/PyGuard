  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling missing data, calculating missing rates, filling missing values, and generating masks for numpy and torch data structures.",
  "sources": "Data input sources include in-memory numpy arrays, torch tensors, pandas DataFrames, and lists converted to numpy arrays.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are in-memory data structures where missing values are filled or masked; no external data leaks or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Sources (raw data with missing values) are processed through fill and mask functions, resulting in modified data arrays/tensors and corresponding masks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard validation and data manipulation operations. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data preprocessing tasks: calculating missing data rates, filling missing values with specified 'nan' values, and generating masks indicating missingness. It handles multiple data types with appropriate conversions and validations. No external system interactions, network calls, or malicious logic are present. The functions are well-documented and use common libraries (numpy, torch, pandas). The logic is clear, and the code structure is conventional. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign, standard utility functions for missing data handling in data science workflows. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal, approximately 0.1, reflecting the low inherent risk of data manipulation functions.",
