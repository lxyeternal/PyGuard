{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for handling missing data in numpy, torch, and pandas data structures, including calculating missing rates, filling missing values, and generating masks.",
  "sources": "Reads input data via function parameters, specifically data arrays, tensors, or dataframes, and checks for missing values using np.isnan, torch.isnan, and pd.isna.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted output; functions manipulate data in memory and return processed results.",
  "flows": "Input data is checked and processed to compute missing rates or fill missing values, with masks generated based on NaN positions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; all functions serve standard data preprocessing purposes. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors identified. No suspicious network activity or external data exfiltration is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing tasks such as computing missing data rates, filling missing values with specified constants, and generating masks for missing data indicators. It uses standard libraries (numpy, torch, pandas) and includes input validation. No obfuscated or malicious code segments are present. The functions operate solely on data in-memory and do not perform network communication, file modification, or other suspicious activities. The assertions and error handling are typical for ensuring data consistency. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for data preprocessing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for data handling with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates solely in-memory on input data, providing standard missing data imputation and analysis functions. There are no network operations, backdoors, or malicious patterns detected.",
