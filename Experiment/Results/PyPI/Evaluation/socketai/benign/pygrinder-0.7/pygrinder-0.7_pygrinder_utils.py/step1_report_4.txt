  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling missing data in datasets, including calculating missing rates, filling missing values, and generating masks for data preprocessing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from variables X, mask, and parameters nan; accesses data properties such as shape, dtype, and NaN values.",
  "sinks": "Returns processed data and masks, with no direct external network or system modification; no external data sinks are observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (X, mask, nan) flows through functions where missing values are identified, replaced, and masks are generated; data is copied and transformed internally; final outputs are returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated segments are present. The code performs standard data handling operations with type checks and assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard data processing routines for missing data management, including calculating missing rates and filling missing values with specified fill values, while generating corresponding masks. Type checks and assertions are in place to prevent type mismatches. The functions are designed for data preprocessing in machine learning workflows. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be well-structured, with proper handling of different data types and clear, documented functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate utility functions aimed at data preprocessing. It contains no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The functions are straightforward, with appropriate safety checks. Overall, it poses no security threat and appears safe for use.",
