  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically, considering the code, its logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is standard data preprocessing utilities with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The functions are straightforward, with proper validation.  \n- **Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard data handling utilities with no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No suspicious code, external communication, or malicious logic.  \n- **Conclusion:** Scores are justified.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Utility functions for missing data handling, with no malicious behavior. Slightly lower confidence but still high.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** The security risk score of 0.1 is slightly above zero but justified given the functions' nature. They manipulate data in memory without external effects. No malware or obfuscation detected.  \n- **Conclusion:** The low risk score is acceptable.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Standard data preprocessing functions, no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No external operations, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate scores.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Utility functions for missing data handling, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious or obfuscated code, and the functions are typical for data preprocessing.  \n- **Conclusion:** Scores are justified.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code or behavior is present.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, which is reasonable given the data manipulation context.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code is standard data preprocessing utility code with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The risk scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0 across all reports.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal, non-malicious data handling, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's benign nature. No malicious or obfuscated code detected, and the security risk is minimal.",
