  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling missing data in numpy, pandas, and torch data structures, including missing rate calculation, masking, filling missing values, and generating masks.",
  "sources": "Data inputs such as arrays, tensors, or dataframes provided to functions like calc_missing_rate, masked_fill, fill_and_get_mask_numpy, fill_and_get_mask_torch, and fill_and_get_mask.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage or manipulation occurs when filling missing data or creating masks, but these are standard data preprocessing steps. No external network or system calls are present. No untrusted data is used to perform unsafe operations like code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Inputs (arrays/tensors/dataframes) are read in calculation and filling functions, processed locally, and returned as filled data and masks. No external data flows or network activities are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The functions are straightforward utility implementations without hidden behaviors. Assert statements are used for validation but are typical for such utility code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides data handling utilities, primarily for missing data analysis and imputation, which are common in data preprocessing workflows. The functions operate on trusted data structures, perform standard numpy/torch/pandas operations, and include input validation. No code injection, system modifications, or malicious network activity is evident. The code does not perform any system calls, file manipulations beyond data filling, or external communications. The use of asserts and type checks is standard for ensuring correct usage. Overall, the code appears to be safe and does not contain malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data utility functions for missing data analysis and handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It is well-structured, with no suspicious anomalies or obfuscated patterns. The overall security risk is minimal, and the functions perform standard data processing tasks.",
