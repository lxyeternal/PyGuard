  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasonableness of their scores, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious code detected. Functions perform standard missing data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior. The high confidence and zero scores are justified.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard data utilities with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Assessment:** No issues found; the functions are typical for data preprocessing.\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate and justified.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, standard utility functions with no suspicious patterns. Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) perhaps due to the nature of data manipulation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The minimal securityRisk score is reasonable, considering data handling could potentially be misused if integrated into malicious workflows, but on its own, it remains benign.\n- **Verdict:** **Reasonable and consistent.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Findings:** Standard data utility functions with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign; no issues.\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, standard data handling utilities with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Assessment:** The functions are straightforward, and the scores reflect that.\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code. The code is purely utility functions for data preprocessing.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** All are very low (0 or 0.1), justified by the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Overall Security Assessment:\n\nThe code is a set of standard, well-structured data handling utilities. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The functions operate solely in-memory, with no external network or file operations, and no suspicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 (acknowledging minimal inherent risk in data manipulation but no actual threat)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above. The code appears safe for deployment and use in data workflows.",
