{
  "purpose": "The code introduces missing data points (NaNs) into datasets based on a threshold involving mean + offset * std, simulating MNAR missingness patterns for data augmentation or testing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'X' (np.ndarray, torch.Tensor, or list), clones data internally to prevent side effects.",
  "sinks": "Modifies 'X' in-place by setting certain values to NaN based on the threshold, no external data transmission or leaks.",
  "flows": "Calculates mean and std per sample, then masks values exceeding mean + offset * std, setting them to NaN within the data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected; straightforward statistical masking.",
  "analysis": "The code performs statistical masking to simulate MNAR missingness, supporting both numpy and torch inputs. It clones data to avoid external side effects, modifies data in-place, and uses standard numpy/torch operations. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present. The logic is transparent and consistent with data augmentation purposes. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for simulating MNAR missing data patterns, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
