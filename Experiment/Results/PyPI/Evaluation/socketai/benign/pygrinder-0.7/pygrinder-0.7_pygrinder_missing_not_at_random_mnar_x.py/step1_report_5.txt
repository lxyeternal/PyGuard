{
  "purpose": "This code introduces missing data patterns (MNAR) into a dataset, specifically for simulating missing not at random scenarios in data analysis or machine learning experiments.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters 'X', which can be numpy.ndarray, torch.Tensor, or list (converted to numpy.ndarray). It also reads an optional 'offset' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The code writes back to the input data variable 'X' by modifying its contents to include NaNs, but does not transmit or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Data is read from 'X' in functions '_mnar_x_numpy' and '_mnar_x_torch'. The missing mask is computed based on data statistics, and then 'X' is modified to include NaNs where missingness is simulated. The modified 'X' is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs are present. The code performs straightforward statistical masking to simulate missing data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to add missing not at random (MNAR) patterns to datasets, supporting numpy and torch tensor formats. It computes the mean and standard deviation per sample, then masks data points where values are less than or equal to the mean plus an offset times the standard deviation, setting those points to NaN. Input validation is minimal but appropriate, and no external data transmission or obscure behavior is evident. The code appears to be intended for data simulation and augmentation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data augmentation utility designed to simulate MNAR missing data patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It operates solely on provided data to produce altered datasets for testing or modeling purposes.",
