{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to introduce missing not at random (MNAR) data patterns into numerical datasets, either in numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor formats, for purposes likely related to data simulation or preprocessing in machine learning.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, specifically from the variables 'X' which can be numpy arrays or torch tensors.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the input data in-place by setting certain values to NaN based on statistical thresholds, but does not send data externally or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data 'X' flows into internal functions (_mnar_x_numpy or _mnar_x_torch), where missing values are calculated based on mean and standard deviation, then applied to the data, and the modified data is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation. It performs straightforward statistical manipulations. No hardcoded credentials or malicious network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to create artificial missing data points in datasets, based on statistical thresholds (mean plus offset times std). It handles both numpy and torch data formats, ensuring data integrity by cloning inputs. The code does not perform any network communications, file access, or system modifications. It strictly manipulates input data to simulate missingness, which appears to be legitimate data preprocessing behavior. No signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data manipulation utility for generating missing data patterns, with no indication of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not include any suspicious network activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The risk score is minimal, and the code appears safe for its intended purpose.",
