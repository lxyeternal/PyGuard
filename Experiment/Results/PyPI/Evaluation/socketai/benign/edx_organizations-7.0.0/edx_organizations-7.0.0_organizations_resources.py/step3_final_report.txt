  "purpose": "This code serves as a documentation comment describing the remote services integration layer, including dependencies, API integrations, and external interactions, intended to be called only by data.py to maintain data layer abstractions.",
  "sources": "The code is purely comments; no data input, output, or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows exist as there is no executable code; thus, no untrusted data processing or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present due to the absence of executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only descriptive comments with no executable code, secrets, or obfuscation; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet is solely documentation comments with no code logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reviews correctly identify the absence of executable code, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior. Scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The comments serve as documentation only, posing no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely descriptive documentation with no executable logic or security concerns. The current scores accurately reflect this, and no further action is necessary.",
