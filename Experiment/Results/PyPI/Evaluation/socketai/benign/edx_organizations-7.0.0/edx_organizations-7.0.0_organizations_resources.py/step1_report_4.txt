  "purpose": "Describes the scope and intended use of a remote services integration layer within a larger system, focusing on external interactions and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code does not explicitly read input or data; it is a comment describing the module's purpose and usage constraints.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No actual code or data flow is present; the comment indicates the module should only be called by data.py, but no executable flow is shown.",
  "anomalies": "The content is purely descriptive comments with no executable code, input handling, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is solely a comment block explaining the design and purpose of a remote services integration module. It emphasizes that the module should only be used by data.py to maintain abstraction. There is no executable logic, no data processing, or data transmission code included. As such, there are no security issues, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation concerns evident in this comment.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a non-executable comment describing the module's scope and usage constraints. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. Overall, the code appears safe and standard in purpose.",
