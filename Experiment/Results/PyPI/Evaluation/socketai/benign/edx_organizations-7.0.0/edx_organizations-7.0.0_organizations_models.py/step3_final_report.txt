  "purpose": "Defines Django ORM models for organizations and their courses, with validation and history tracking.",
  "sources": "Reads input from model fields (short_name, course_id, logo), validation in clean() method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; validation prevents invalid short_name characters.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from user input into model fields, validated in clean(), stored in database.",
  "anomalies": "Help text indicates PNG restriction for logo images but no server-side validation enforces this; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward Django models with standard validation, no external network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. Regex validation on 'short_name' is simple and appropriate. ImageField relies on help text for PNG restriction but lacks server-side enforcement, which is a minor security consideration. No suspicious or malicious logic is present. The history tracking is standard. Overall, the code appears safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The models are standard, secure, and free from malicious or suspicious code. The only minor concern is the lack of server-side validation for PNG images, which does not constitute a security vulnerability but could be improved. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal risk. The reports' assessments and scores are consistent with the code's analysis.",
