  "purpose": "Define Django ORM models for managing organizations and their course links within a learning management system.",
  "sources": "Imports from Django modules, regular expression validation in the clean() method.",
  "sinks": "Validation errors raised in clean() method, database write operations via model save() methods.",
  "flows": "User input for short_name and course_id flows through model fields and validation, potentially raising ValidationError or saving to the database.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no external network calls, no code that dynamically executes untrusted input, and no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Django models with standard fields and validation. The 'clean' method validates 'short_name' using a regex to prevent invalid characters. Image uploads are restricted to PNG files via help_text guidance, but no enforced file type validation exists at the code level. There are no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. The models primarily manage metadata with standard validation and do not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard Django ORM models for organizational data management with proper validation for the 'short_name' field. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a straightforward implementation for data modeling with no apparent supply chain security threats.",
