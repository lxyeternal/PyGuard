  "conclusion": "The models are standard, secure, and free from malicious or suspicious code. The only minor concern is the lack of server-side validation for PNG images, which does not constitute a security vulnerability but could be improved. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal risk. The reports' assessments and scores are consistent with the code's analysis."
