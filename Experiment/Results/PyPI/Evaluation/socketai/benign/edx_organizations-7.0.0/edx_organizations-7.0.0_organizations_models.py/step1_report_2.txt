  "purpose": "Define Django ORM models for organizations and their associated courses, with validation and history tracking.",
  "sources": "Django model fields, regex validation in the clean() method.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "User input data (short_name) flows through the model validation, particularly the clean() method, but no external sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Validation regex appears standard. No dynamic code execution or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Django models with standard fields, validation, and history tracking. The 'clean()' method enforces a regex on 'short_name' to prevent invalid characters, which is typical for data validation. No external data transmissions, system modifications, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be straightforward ORM model definitions with no malicious intent or dangerous behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical Django model implementation for managing organizations and course links. There are no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks. It performs standard validation and data modeling without external or covert data handling.",
