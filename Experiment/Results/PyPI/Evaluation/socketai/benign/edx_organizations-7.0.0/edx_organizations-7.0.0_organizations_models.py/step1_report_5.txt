{
  "purpose": "Define Django ORM models for organizations and their courses, managing metadata and relationships.",
  "sources": "User inputs via model fields (short_name, course_id), image uploads (logo), and data validation in the clean method.",
  "sinks": "Database storage of organization info, course links, and uploaded images. No direct data output or external network communication.",
  "flows": "Input data (short_name, course_id, logo) -> Validation and constraints -> Database storage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic code, and no unusual or obfuscated code detected. The validation regex for short_name is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The models use standard Django features with input validation to prevent invalid characters in short_name. ImageField specifies PNG images but does not perform file validation beyond the help text, which is a non-security concern. No external network calls, code injection points, or data leaks are present. The use of HistoricalRecords indicates change tracking but does not introduce malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears standard for a Django application managing organizational metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django ORM model implementation for managing organizations and their courses. It employs standard validation and data handling practices without any malicious or suspicious features. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
