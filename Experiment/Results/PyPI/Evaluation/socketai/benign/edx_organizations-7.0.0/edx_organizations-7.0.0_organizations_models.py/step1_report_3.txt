  "purpose": "Define Django ORM models for organizations and their associated courses, managing metadata and relationships.",
  "sources": "Model fields (name, short_name, description, logo, course_id, organization), validation methods, and imports.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no data leaks or insecure outputs identified.",
  "flows": "User inputs or data validated through model fields and the clean() method flow from input data to database storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. The only validation is for 'short_name' format, with no hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes Django models with validation for the 'short_name' field, restricts logo file types to PNG via help text, and enforces uniqueness constraints. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. Import statements are standard for Django apps. No network operations, external data fetching, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard Django ORM model definitions with appropriate validation. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this fragment.",
