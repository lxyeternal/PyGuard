{
  "purpose": "The code defines Django ORM models for managing organizations and their associated courses within a system, primarily for data storage and retrieval.",
  "sources": "User input data via model fields such as 'short_name' and 'course_id'. External files for logos uploaded through 'logo' ImageField.",
  "sinks": "Database writes for organization and course data, image uploads for logos.",
  "flows": "Input data (short_name, course_id, logo) is validated and then stored in the database. Uploaded images are saved to 'organization_logos' directory.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex validation on 'short_name' is standard; no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. Image upload constrained to PNG via help text, but no enforced file type validation at the model level. No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No evident backdoors, network communication, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Django models with basic validation. The 'clean' method enforces character restrictions on 'short_name'. The 'logo' ImageField suggests image uploads, but there's no explicit security check on the file type beyond help text. Foreign key constraints and unique constraints are used appropriately. No malicious logic, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to be a straightforward ORM model implementation for managing organizational data and associated courses.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Django ORM model code with basic validation and no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It appears safe for use from a security perspective.",
