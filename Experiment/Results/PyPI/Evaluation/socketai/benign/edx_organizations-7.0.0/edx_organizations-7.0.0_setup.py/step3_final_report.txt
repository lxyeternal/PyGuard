  "anomalies": "Comments referencing SEMgrep modifications; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks with regex parsing for requirements and version info. It does not execute untrusted code, connect to networks, or contain obfuscated or malicious logic. Comments about automated modifications are benign. The code is straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
