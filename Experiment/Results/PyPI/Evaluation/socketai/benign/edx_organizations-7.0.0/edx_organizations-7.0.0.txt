      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The models are standard, secure, and free from malicious or suspicious code. The only minor concern is the lack of server-side validation for PNG images, which does not constitute a security vulnerability but could be improved. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal risk. The reports' assessments and scores are consistent with the code's analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of role-based access control with no malicious or obfuscated components. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 assigned in some reports is justified but could be lowered to 0 for accuracy. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malware risk."
