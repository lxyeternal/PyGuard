  "purpose": "Validate the integrity of inbound course key and organization data before processing or storage.",
  "sources": "The function calls and parameter inputs: course_key and organization_data.",
  "targets": "The validation functions and data returned or used for further processing.",
  "flows": "Input data (course_key, organization_data) flows into validation functions, which return boolean results based on data integrity checks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed. The code is straightforward validation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and errors from the opaque_keys library to validate course keys. It performs null checks and exception handling to ensure course keys are valid. Organization data validation checks for presence and non-empty 'id' and 'name' fields. No suspicious code, dynamic execution, or external data transmission observed. The validation logic is typical and does not involve insecure operations or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard validation of input data with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be normal validation code intended for ensuring data integrity.",
