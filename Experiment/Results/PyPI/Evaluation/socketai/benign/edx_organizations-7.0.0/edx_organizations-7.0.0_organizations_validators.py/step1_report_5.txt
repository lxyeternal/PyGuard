  "purpose": "Validate the integrity of inbound course key and organization data before processing or transfer.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'course_key' and 'organization_data' in the functions 'course_key_is_valid' and 'organization_data_is_valid'.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as there are no data leaks, external calls, or sensitive operations in the code.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into validation functions which return boolean results; no external or unsafe operations are performed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs observed. The code relies on standard library functions for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic validation of input data: checking for None, string conversion, and validation via 'CourseKey.from_string'. It handles specific exceptions without executing any external or unsafe operations. Organization data validation checks presence and non-emptiness of 'id' and 'name'. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard validation module with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs simple input validation without any suspicious activity.",
