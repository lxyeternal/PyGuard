  "purpose": "Validate course key objects and organization data for integrity before further processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'course_key' and 'organization_data' passed to validation functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements indicating validation success or failure; no external sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Input data → validation checks → return boolean indicating validity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward validation checks on input data. It uses exception handling for parsing course keys and simple key presence/absence checks for organization data. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; it does not process or handle untrusted data beyond validation, and no external data flows or network operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve a legitimate validation purpose without any malicious intent. No indicators of malware or security risks are present.",
