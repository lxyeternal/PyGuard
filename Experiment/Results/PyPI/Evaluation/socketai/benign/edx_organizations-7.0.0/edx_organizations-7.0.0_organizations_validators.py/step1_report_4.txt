{
  "purpose": "Validate course key objects and organization data structures to ensure their integrity before further processing.",
  "sources": "The function parameters 'course_key' and 'organization_data' are the sources of input data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources or perform any risky operations; it only returns boolean validation results.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are converted to strings and passed to 'CourseKey.from_string'; validation results are returned based on these checks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns are present. The code relies on imported validation functions; no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward validation: checking for None, attempting to parse 'course_key' with 'CourseKey.from_string', and ensuring 'organization_data' contains non-empty 'id' and 'name' fields. It handles exceptions properly, and no unsafe operations or external data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard validation module with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply checks input formats and presence of expected data fields.",
