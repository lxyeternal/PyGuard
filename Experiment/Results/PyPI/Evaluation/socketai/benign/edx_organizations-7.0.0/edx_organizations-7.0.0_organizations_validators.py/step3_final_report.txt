  "purpose": "Validation of course keys and organization data to ensure integrity before processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'course_key' and 'organization_data' provided to validation functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; validation functions only process data internally without external output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into validation functions, which check for None, format correctness, and key presence, then return boolean results.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with exception handling for invalid course keys and simple key presence checks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation on inputs using established methods and exception handling. It relies on a trusted third-party library for course key validation and performs basic presence and non-emptiness checks for organization data. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The exception handling is appropriate, and the logic is sound. Given the benign nature, no external network activity or malicious intent is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-specific validation module with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments across reports are accurate and justified. No improvements or changes are necessary.",
