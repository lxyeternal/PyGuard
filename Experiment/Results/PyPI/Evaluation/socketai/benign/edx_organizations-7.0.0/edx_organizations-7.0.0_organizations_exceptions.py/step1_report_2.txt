  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for validation errors related to courses and organizations, and a helper function to raise these exceptions with formatted messages.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: entity_type, entity, exception in raise_exception function",
  "sinks": "The raise_exception function raises an exception with a formatted message, potentially including untrusted data",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the raise_exception function, which constructs a message and raises an exception",
  "anomalies": "The exception message is encoded using .encode('utf-8') before being passed to the exception, which is unusual and may interfere with exception handling but is not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom validation exception classes inheriting from Django's ValidationError, which is standard. The helper function raise_exception formats a message with entity details and raises the provided exception class. The message is encoded to UTF-8 bytes before being passed to the exception. This encoding step is unconventional but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or malicious behavior is evident. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. It solely provides exception handling logic, which is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions and an exception-raising helper. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The only minor concern is the encoding of the message, which may interfere with exception handling but does not pose security threats.",
