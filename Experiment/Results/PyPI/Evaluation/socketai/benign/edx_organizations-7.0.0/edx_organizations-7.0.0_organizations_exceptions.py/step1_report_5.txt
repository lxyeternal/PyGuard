{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for validation errors related to courses and organizations, and provide a helper function to raise these exceptions with a formatted message.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the function parameters 'entity_type', 'entity', and 'exception'.",
  "sinks": "The 'raise_exception' function raises an exception with a message, which could potentially include untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'entity_type' and 'entity' flow into the formatted message, which is then encoded and passed to raise the exception.",
  "anomalies": "The function encodes the message to UTF-8 before raising the exception; this is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Django's ValidationError, used for specific validation errors. The 'raise_exception' function constructs an error message incorporating user-provided data and raises the given exception class with this message. The message is encoded in UTF-8, which is standard for handling Unicode data in Python 3, although encoding before raising an exception is somewhat redundant and atypical. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. Overall, the code's purpose is to handle validation error reporting, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines exception classes and a helper to raise exceptions with formatted messages. It does not contain malware or security risks. The encoding step is unusual but not harmful. The code appears safe and legitimate for its purpose.",
