  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for validation errors in a Django application and provide a helper function to raise these exceptions with messages.",
  "sources": "Import from django.core.exceptions, use of function parameters 'entity_type', 'entity', and 'exception'.",
  "sinks": "The 'raise_exception' function raises an exception with a message that includes entity details.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'entity_type' and 'entity' flow into the exception message construction, which is then raised as an exception.",
  "anomalies": "The 'raise_exception' function encodes the exception message with UTF-8 before raising, which is unnecessary in Python 3 as strings are unicode by default; this could be a sign of misguided encoding handling but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom validation exception classes inheriting from Django's ValidationError. These classes are straightforward, used for validation validation and do not contain malicious logic. The 'raise_exception' function constructs an error message by concatenating entity information into a string, then encodes this message to bytes and raises the provided exception with this bytes object as the message. In Python 3, exceptions typically accept string messages, and passing bytes may cause unintended behavior or errors. There is no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code is primarily for validation and error handling, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a validation utility within a Django app, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The encoding step is unnecessary but not malicious. Overall, the code is benign.",
