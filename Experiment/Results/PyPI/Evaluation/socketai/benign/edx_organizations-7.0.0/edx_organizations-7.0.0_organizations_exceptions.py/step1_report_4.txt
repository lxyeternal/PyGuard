{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for validation errors and provide a helper to raise these exceptions with a formatted message.",
  "sources": "Import statement for Django's ValidationError; function parameters 'entity_type', 'entity', 'exception'; string literals",
  "sinks": "The raise_exception function raises an exception with a message encoded in utf-8; no data sinks that leak untrusted input externally are evident",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'entity_type' and 'entity' flow into the formatted string, which is then encoded and raised as an exception",
  "anomalies": "The exception message is encoded in utf-8 before raising, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Django's ValidationError for specific validation contexts. The raise_exception function constructs an error message using provided entity details and encodes this message in utf-8 before raising the exception. Encoding messages in utf-8 within exceptions is uncommon but does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. The code appears straightforward and standard for Django-based validation handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate implementation of custom exceptions and an exception-raising helper. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The utf-8 encoding step is unusual but not malicious. Overall, the code appears safe.",
