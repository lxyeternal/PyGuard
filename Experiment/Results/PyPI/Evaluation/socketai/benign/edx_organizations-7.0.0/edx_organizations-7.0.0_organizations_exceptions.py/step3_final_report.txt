  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes inheriting from Django's ValidationError and a helper function to raise exceptions with formatted messages.",
  "sources": "The function 'raise_exception' constructs a message string and uses it as an argument to the exception class.",
  "sinks": "The constructed message (after encoding) is passed to the exception constructor, which raises it.",
  "flows": "The message string is formatted, encoded to bytes, then passed to the exception, which is raised.",
  "anomalies": "The message is encoded into bytes (.encode('utf-8')) before raising an exception, which is unconventional in Python 3 where exception messages are expected to be strings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines validation exception classes and a helper to raise exceptions with formatted messages. The main anomaly is the encoding of the message to bytes, which is unnecessary and could cause issues if exception handling expects a string. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The encoding step appears to be a coding mistake rather than malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0.1, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate, reflecting a benign code with a minor coding practice issue. The overall assessment confirms the code is safe, with no supply chain threats or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a validation utility. The only concern is the unnecessary encoding of exception messages into bytes, which is a minor coding flaw but not a security risk. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
