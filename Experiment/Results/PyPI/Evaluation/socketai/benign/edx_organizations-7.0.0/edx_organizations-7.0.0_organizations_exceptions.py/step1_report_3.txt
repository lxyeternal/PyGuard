  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for validation errors related to course keys and organizations, with a helper function to raise exceptions.",
  "sources": "The function raise_exception receives entity_type, entity, and exception as input parameters.",
  "sinks": "The raise_exception function raises an exception with a formatted message encoded in UTF-8.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to generate an error message which is then encoded and passed to raise an exception, resulting in program termination or error handling.",
  "anomalies": "The encode('utf-8') call inside the raise_exception function is unusual; normally, exception messages are strings, not bytes. This may lead to unexpected behavior or be used to obfuscate or mishandle error messages.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception subclasses based on Django's ValidationError, which is standard practice for validation. The raise_exception function constructs an error message with string formatting and encodes it into bytes before raising the exception. Encoding error messages to bytes before raising an exception is uncommon and could potentially cause issues if the exception handling code expects a string. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. The unusual encoding may be a mistake or an attempt to obscure the error message.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard validation exception handling with an unusual use of encoding the message to bytes before raising the exception. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks, though the encoding choice is atypical and may cause issues or confusion.",
