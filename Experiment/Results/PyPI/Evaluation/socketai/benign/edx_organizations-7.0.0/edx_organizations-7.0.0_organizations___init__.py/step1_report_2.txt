  "purpose": "Module initialization for the edx-organizations app, likely setting up versioning information.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths since the code only defines a version string.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual code or hardcoded secrets beyond a version string.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a docstring comment and a version string assignment. It lacks any input handling, output, or complex logic. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The version string is standard and does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module initialization snippet containing only a version declaration. No malicious or security-relevant code is present.",
