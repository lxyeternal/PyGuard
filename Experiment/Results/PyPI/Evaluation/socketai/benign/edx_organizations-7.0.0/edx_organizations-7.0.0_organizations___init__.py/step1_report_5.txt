  "sources": "The only source of data is the hardcoded string '__version__' = '7.0.0'.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or operations involving untrusted input or sensitive data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as the code only defines a version string.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious constructs. It is minimal and straightforward.",
