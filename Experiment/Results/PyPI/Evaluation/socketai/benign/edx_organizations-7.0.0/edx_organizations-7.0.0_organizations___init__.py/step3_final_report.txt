{
  "purpose": "Declare the version of the package and serve as a module initialization file.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of __version__ and the module docstring.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment without data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic execution; straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module with a docstring and a version string assignment, typical for __init__.py files. No input sources, data sinks, or data flows are present. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and transparency. The code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks or contain malicious payloads. The assessments are consistent and accurate, with no logical flaws or errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization snippet with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
