  "purpose": "Define custom permission to restrict access based on user role in a Django REST Framework viewset.",
  "sources": "request.method, request.user attributes",
  "sinks": "return statement based on user attributes, permission check logic",
  "flows": "request method and user role check determine permission granting",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple permission class that allows any request except for PUT requests, which require the user to be staff or superuser. The logic is straightforward, involving no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling. The code relies on standard Django user attributes and REST framework permission mechanisms, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code. Overall, it appears to be a standard permission class with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical permission class for role-based access control, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply restricts PUT requests to staff or superusers, which is a common pattern.",
