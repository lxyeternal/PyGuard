  "purpose": "Define a custom permission class to restrict access based on user roles in a Django REST Framework viewset.",
  "sources": "request.method, request.user.is_staff, request.user.is_superuser",
  "sinks": "Return statement within has_permission method",
  "flows": "Request data (method and user attributes) flows into permission check, influencing access decision",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed; code is straightforward permission logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard permission class and defines a custom permission to allow 'PUT' requests only for staff or superusers, while allowing all other requests. The logic appears to be standard role-based access control without any obfuscation or malicious constructs. No external data is read in a suspicious manner, and no unsafe operations are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple permission class implementing standard role-based access logic for specific request methods. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears to be safe and intended for normal use.",
