  "purpose": "Define custom permission class for organization viewsets to restrict access based on user roles.",
  "sources": "request.method, request.user attributes (is_staff, is_superuser)",
  "sinks": "Permission evaluation in has_permission method",
  "flows": "request.method and user attributes influence permission decision",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard custom permission class for Django REST Framework. It checks if the request method is 'PUT' and grants permission only if the user is staff or superuser; otherwise, it grants permission for all other methods. There are no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no external data leaks or malicious actions. The logic is straightforward and aligns with common permission patterns. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or suspicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical permission class implementation without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs role-based access control with no suspicious or harmful behavior.",
