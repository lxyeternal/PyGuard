  "purpose": "Define custom permission to allow only staff or superuser for PUT requests in a Django REST Framework viewset.",
  "sources": "request.method, request.user.is_staff, request.user.is_superuser",
  "sinks": "Permission check in has_permission method, which controls access to view actions",
  "flows": "Request data flows from request.method and request.user properties into permission logic; outcome determines access",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and standard for permissions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard permission class, defines a class with a method that checks if the request method is PUT and verifies if the user is staff or superuser. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present. It performs a simple role check, which is typical in access control logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard permission class for access control, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
