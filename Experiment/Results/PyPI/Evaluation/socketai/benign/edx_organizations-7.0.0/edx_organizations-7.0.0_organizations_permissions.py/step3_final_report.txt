  "purpose": "Defines a role-based permission class 'UserIsStaff' that restricts PUT requests to staff or superusers, allowing all other requests.",
  "sources": "request.method, request.user.is_staff, request.user.is_superuser",
  "sinks": "Permission decision based on user attributes for PUT requests",
  "flows": "request.method and user attributes determine permission; no external data flows or untrusted inputs are processed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple, role-based permission check in Django REST Framework. It grants all requests except for PUT, which is restricted to staff or superusers. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The logic is clear, and the security implications are minimal. The permission class relies solely on user attributes and request method, with no external data or complex flows. The code aligns with common access control practices and does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of role-based access control with no malicious or obfuscated components. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 assigned in some reports is justified but could be lowered to 0 for accuracy. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malware risk.",
