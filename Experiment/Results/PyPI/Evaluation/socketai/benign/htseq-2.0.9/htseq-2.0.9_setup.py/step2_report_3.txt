  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, assessing the scores, and ensuring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script, reading environment variables, system info, subprocess outputs, version, README.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses subprocess for git, typical build commands; file reads/writes for versioning.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Subprocess commands are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The script performs typical build and version management tasks. All subprocess calls (git, cython, swig) are common in build processes. No obfuscation or malicious code observed.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The script is a legitimate setup script with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup tasks, reading environment variables, executing shell commands.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses subprocess with shell=True, which warrants caution but is common in build scripts.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious credentials or code. Use of subprocess with shell=True is noted but standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity. The slight security risk score (0.1) reflects the use of shell=True, which is acceptable in controlled build environments.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is accurate. No malware or backdoors detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard build setup, including versioning, dependencies, and preprocessing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External commands (git, cython, swig), file operations, dynamic version updates.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious credentials or obfuscated code. Use of subprocess with shell=True is noted but typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The script performs expected build steps, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The slight increase in security risk score accounts for subprocess with shell=True but remains within normal bounds.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar build and preprocessing script, with environment variables and subprocess calls.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard subprocess execution, file reads/writes, environment variable influence.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. Use of subprocess with shell=True is noted but typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The script is a typical build setup with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No malware or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Setup script with versioning, dependencies, extension compilation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External commands via subprocess, file operations, environment variables.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation. Use of subprocess with shell=True is noted but standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code performs expected setup tasks without malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malware present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly elevated due to use of subprocess with shell=True, which is common but can be risky if inputs are untrusted. The scores (0.1-0.2) are reasonable.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk (Security):** 0.2 — the use of subprocess with shell=True is standard but warrants cautious handling; no active vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a legitimate, well-structured setup script with no security concerns beyond typical subprocess usage.",
