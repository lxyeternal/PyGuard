  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the HTSeq package, managing versioning, dependencies, and extension compilation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, subprocess calls (git, cython, swig), file reads/writes for version info, README, and extension sources.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess executions for version detection and preprocessing, file operations for versioning and copying modules.",
  "flows": "Version info from git or file flows into version file and _version.py; external tools invoked via subprocess for preprocessing and build steps.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with shell=True in build commands; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical build and setup tasks, including version management, dependency specification, preprocessing, and extension compilation. Subprocess calls are standard in build scripts, and no malicious or obfuscated code is present. The use of shell=True is noted but acceptable in controlled build environments. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Python package setup script with no security concerns. The minor security risk associated with subprocess shell=True is acceptable given the context. The overall supply chain security posture is very low risk.",
