{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for reading, parsing, and handling various bioinformatics data formats such as FASTA, FASTQ, BAM, BED, VCF, and BigWig, primarily for sequencing data analysis.",
  "sources": "File input streams, external library functions (e.g., pysam, pyBigWig), and data attributes within classes.",
  "sinks": "Data objects, file outputs, and external library calls; no network or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Input files are read into data structures; external libraries process or index data; data objects are manipulated and returned; no malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors identified; code is straightforward and standard for bioinformatics utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data parsers, file readers, and wrappers around well-known bioinformatics libraries. It performs file I/O, data parsing, and object creation without executing system commands, network activity, or dynamic code execution. External dependencies are managed with proper error handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The code is transparent, with no signs of obfuscation or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source bioinformatics toolkit with no malicious or sabotage features. It relies on standard external libraries used appropriately, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors. The overall security risk is very low.",
