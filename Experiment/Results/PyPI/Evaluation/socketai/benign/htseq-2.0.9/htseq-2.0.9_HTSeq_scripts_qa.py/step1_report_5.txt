{
  "purpose": "This script performs quality assessment on high-throughput sequencing reads by analyzing input files in various formats and generating plots of base distributions and quality scores.",
  "sources": "Reads from input files (SAM, BAM, FastQ, etc.), environment variables indirectly through library imports, user input via command line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Output files (PDF plots), standard output messages, error messages to standard error, potential data leakage if file paths or data are sensitive.",
  "flows": "Input files are read and processed through HTSeq library functions; data flows from file readers into arrays; results are normalized and plotted; output files are generated; status messages are printed during processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code patterns; no network connections or data exfiltration observed; exception handling is broad but standard; use of third-party libraries appears legitimate. No suspicious or malicious code or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard bioinformatics quality assessment tool, using well-known libraries (HTSeq, numpy, matplotlib). It reads sequencing data, processes base and quality counts, normalizes data, and produces plots. Error handling is basic but acceptable. No code sections indicate malicious intent such as network activity, data theft, or backdoor functionality. The code structure and flow are consistent with legitimate analysis scripts. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate biological data analysis tool with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It processes sequencing data securely and outputs visual quality reports. The overall security risk is negligible.",
