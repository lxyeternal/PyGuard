{
  "purpose": "The script performs quality assessment on high-throughput sequencing reads by analyzing input files in various formats and generating summary plots as a PDF.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input files specified by filename, using different HTSeq reader classes depending on the file type; reads include sequence data and quality scores.",
  "sinks": "Generated plots are saved to a PDF file; console output for progress updates; no other untrusted sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file input through read processing functions, accumulates counts and quality metrics, then flows into plotting functions which generate and save visualizations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors. Use of try-except for error handling is standard. No dynamic code execution or network activity is present. The code relies on established scientific libraries (HTSeq, numpy, matplotlib).",
  "analysis": "The code initializes by parsing command-line arguments and reading sequencing data files using HTSeq. It processes reads or alignments, accumulating base and quality score counts with normalization. It provides progress reports during processing. The plotting functions generate visual summaries of base composition and quality scores. No code sections execute external commands, network connections, or store data remotely. The code's behavior aligns with its declared purpose, and no malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a legitimate, well-structured bioinformatics quality control tool with no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It employs standard libraries and practices appropriate for its purpose, and no suspicious or harmful code features are present.",
