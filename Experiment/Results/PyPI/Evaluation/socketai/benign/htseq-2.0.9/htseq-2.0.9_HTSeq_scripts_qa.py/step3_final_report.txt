  "purpose": "Performs sequencing quality assessment by analyzing read data, generating base composition and quality score plots, and outputting a PDF report.",
  "sources": "Reads input files via HTSeq library functions, accessing read sequences and quality scores.",
  "sinks": "Generates a PDF file with plots; outputs progress messages to standard output; no network activity or external data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input files -> HTSeq readers -> numpy arrays for base and quality counts -> normalization functions -> matplotlib plotting -> PDF output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard bioinformatics quality control script that reads sequencing data, counts bases and quality scores, normalizes data, and produces visual plots. It uses well-known libraries (HTSeq, numpy, matplotlib) without any obfuscation or malicious features. No network activity or external data exfiltration is present. The code structure is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to processing untrusted input files, which is typical for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured bioinformatics quality assessment tool with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The assigned scores are consistent with its benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a very low security risk score (~0.1-0.2). No modifications are necessary.",
