{
  "purpose": "This script performs read counting in genomic data by processing SAM/BAM files against features defined in a GFF/GTF file, supporting parallel processing and output customization.",
  "sources": "Reads are read from input SAM/BAM files, validated by attempting to open them with pysam, and feature annotations are loaded from the GFF/GTF file.",
  "sinks": "Output counts are written to a specified file or stdout; SAM/BAM files are validated by opening; output files are created or appended based on user options.",
  "flows": "Input files are validated and opened; features are loaded into memory; read counts are computed in parallel or serially; results are merged and written to output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. File validation via early opening is standard practice, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard bioinformatics libraries (HTSeq, pysam), performs input validation, parallel processing, and output handling in a typical manner. No network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present. The custom argparse action ensures unique argument lists. The overall structure and logic are consistent with legitimate open-source bioinformatics tools.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard read counting pipeline with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the code is safe for use in bioinformatics workflows.",
