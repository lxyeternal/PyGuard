  "purpose": "Internal utility functions for processing genomic intervals and vectors in HTSeq, a bioinformatics library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for HTSeq and numpy modules; no external input reading present in the functions themselves.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications; functions operate on in-memory data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows within functions manipulating genomic intervals and vectors; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs found.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple generator functions for iterating over genomic intervals and vectorized data structures. It relies on standard libraries (HTSeq, numpy). The logic appears to be for internal data processing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. No external input sources or network interactions are present. The code correctly handles different data structures and edge cases typical for bioinformatics data, with no indications of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be safe, well-structured utility functions for genomic data processing without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
