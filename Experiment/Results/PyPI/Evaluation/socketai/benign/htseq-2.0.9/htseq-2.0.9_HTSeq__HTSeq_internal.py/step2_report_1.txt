  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is standard internal functions for genomic data processing, with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 (confidence 0.95)\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected. The high confidence and zero malware score are justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the functions are standard, with no external data handling or malicious patterns. Slightly higher securityRisk (0.1) possibly due to the nature of genomic data processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (confidence 1)\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The minor securityRisk is acceptable given the context; no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard internal utility functions with no suspicious activity. The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), but still no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Justified; no issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Internal functions with standard operations, no external input or malicious patterns. Confidence is high (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others—standard, safe utility functions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity, which aligns with the code's nature as internal utility functions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, given the absence of external data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very minimal, mostly due to the context of genomic data processing but no actual risks present)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and justified. The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The risk scores could be slightly lowered from 0.1 to 0.05 to reflect the negligible risk more precisely, but the current scores are acceptable.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.05\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's safety and the appropriateness of the given assessments.",
