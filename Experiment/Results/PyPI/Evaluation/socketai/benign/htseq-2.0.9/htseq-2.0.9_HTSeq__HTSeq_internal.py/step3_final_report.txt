  "purpose": "Internal utility functions for processing genomic intervals and vectors using HTSeq and numpy.",
  "sources": "Reads data from HTSeq objects and numpy arrays; no external input or data sinks.",
  "sinks": "None; operates solely on in-memory data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input objects (HTSeq intervals, vectors) through iteration and generator functions, with no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected. The code is straightforward and standard for bioinformatics data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions for generating genomic position ranges, iterating over genomic intervals and vectors, and extracting steps from data structures. It uses standard libraries and data structures without external data handling or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The functions are internal utilities typical in genomic data pipelines, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk scores and zero malware scores are justified. The assessments across all reports are accurate and consistent.",
