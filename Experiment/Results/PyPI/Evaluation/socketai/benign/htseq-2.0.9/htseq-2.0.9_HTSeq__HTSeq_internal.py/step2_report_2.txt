  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is internal utility functions for genomic data processing, with no malicious behavior or suspicious logic.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is standard, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. These seem appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, uses well-known libraries, and performs typical data iteration. No external threats or malicious patterns are evident.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's confidence (0.95) is justified, and the scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, emphasizing that the code is standard, with no malicious intent, and no external data handling.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's nature. The securityRisk is set at 0.1, perhaps reflecting a very minimal inherent risk in handling genomic data structures, but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. These are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious patterns or external data flows are present. The slight securityRisk may be a generic acknowledgment of the potential for bugs or data mishandling, but not malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The confidence (1) is appropriate; scores are justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is standard internal functions with no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The detailed analysis confirms the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. These are consistent.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external threats are evident.\n- **Conclusion:** The confidence (0.9) and scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard internal utility functions, no external input, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The functions operate on known data structures, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. These are justified.\n- **Justification:** No external data flows, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** The confidence (0.9) and scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar conclusion: safe, standard utility functions, no malicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The functions are purely internal, with no external data or network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. All appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no suspicious elements.\n- **Conclusion:** The confidence (0.9) and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the code's clarity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1) in some reports, but overall very low, reflecting minimal inherent risk, not malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to potential for bugs or misinterpretation, but not malicious)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard set of internal functions for genomic data processing, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores across reports are consistent and justified.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed; the scores accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.",
