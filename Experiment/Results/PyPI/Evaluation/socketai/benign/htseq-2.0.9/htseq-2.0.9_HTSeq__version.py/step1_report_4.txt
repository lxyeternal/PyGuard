  "purpose": "Assign the version string to the __version__ variable, typically used for package versioning.",
  "sources": "None, as the code only defines a variable with a string literal.",
  "sinks": "None, no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only a static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of any complex or suspicious code; only a version string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a version variable assignment with a static string. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs. The version string indicates package versioning but does not pose any security risks by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a package version indicator with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
