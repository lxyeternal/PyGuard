  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports describe the code as a simple assignment: `__version__ = \"2.0.9\"`. This is a standard pattern in Python packages for version declaration. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code, no data processing, and no suspicious constructs. Therefore, **no issues or malicious behavior are present** in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version string assignment, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n- `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n- `malware`: 0 (no malware)\n- `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is purely declarative, assigns no data, and has no suspicious behavior, **a security risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted**. The current score of 0 aligns well with the analysis.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nThe reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a standard version declaration.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, standard version declaration. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and is typical in Python projects. The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n**The reports are accurate and appropriate. No changes needed.**",
