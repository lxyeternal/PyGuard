  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "This snippet only assigns a version string to the __version__ variable. It contains no input/output operations, no code execution, and no suspicious logic. It appears to be a standard version declaration commonly found in Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to define the package version. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
