  "purpose": "Declare the version of the Python package",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string '__version__' to '2.0.9'",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved",
  "flows": "N/A; simple static assignment with no data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version string assignment, no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to '__version__', a common practice in Python packages. It contains no input/output, dynamic code, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The existing reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
