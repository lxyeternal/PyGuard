  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports describe the code as a simple assignment: `__version__ = \"2.0.9\"`. This is a standard practice in Python packages and contains no input/output, data processing, or suspicious constructs. Therefore, **there are no issues or malicious behaviors present in the code itself**.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version string assignment with no anomalies, suspicious logic, or malicious intent. No flaws or logical errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n- obfuscated: 0\n- malware: 0\n- securityRisk: 0\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, these scores seem appropriate and consistent across all reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports conclude that the code is benign with no malicious or suspicious behavior, **risk scores should remain at 0**. Any higher score would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nNo claims are made about potential vulnerabilities; all assessments are based on direct analysis of the code snippet, which is appropriate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the code's nature—simple, static assignment with no suspicious features.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward version string assignment, typical in Python packages. All reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's benign nature. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code snippet poses no security concern.",
