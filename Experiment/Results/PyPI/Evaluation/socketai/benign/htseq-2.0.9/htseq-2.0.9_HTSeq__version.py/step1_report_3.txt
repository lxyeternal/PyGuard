  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module as '2.0.9'.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; static assignment of version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies, no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single variable assignment setting '__version__' to '2.0.9'. There are no inputs, no functions, no external data handling, and no suspicious behavior observed. This pattern is common in Python packages for version tracking and does not contain any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns.",
