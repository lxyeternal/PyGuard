{
  "purpose": "A Python wrapper for a C++ piecewise constant vector data structure, enabling efficient storage and manipulation of step-wise data.",
  "sources": "Data inputs through method calls such as set_value, add_value, get_values_pystyle, and iteration over steps.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; data flows internally within the wrapper and C++ module, with no network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input data via method calls flows into the underlying C++ object; data retrieval flows from C++ back to Python through getters and iteration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code is auto-generated and follows standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SWIG-generated Python interface for a C++ class managing piecewise constant vectors. It provides methods for setting, removing, and retrieving values, as well as iteration and comparison. No malicious behavior, external communication, or obfuscation is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, auto-generated nature of the code. The low security risk score reflects the minimal threat posed by such wrappers, assuming the underlying C++ code is secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign auto-generated wrapper with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
