  "purpose": "Provides custom reStructuredText roles for referencing tickets and issues in documentation, generating hyperlinks based on user input.",
  "sources": "User-provided text input in role directives, parsed via regex.",
  "sinks": "Generated URLs for external issue trackers; no data leaks or external system calls.",
  "flows": "Input text -> regex parsing -> URL string concatenation -> hyperlink node creation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; straightforward URL generation with input parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that parse input text with a simple regex, then construct URLs for tickets and issues, creating reference nodes for documentation. The regex is safe, and URLs are static templates concatenated with user input. No external calls, file operations, or malicious code are present. The setup function registers these roles. The code is purpose-specific, benign, and free of obfuscation or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior and pose no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, purpose-specific, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate; no modifications are necessary.",
