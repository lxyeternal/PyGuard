{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes for the pyxb library, mainly to handle XML schema validation and binding errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily from the import statements, class initializers, and string formatting methods. No external data inputs are processed directly.",
  "sinks": "The exception classes include __str__ methods that generate messages; however, these are used for debugging or user feedback and do not involve untrusted data flows or external data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; the code is centered around exception handling and message formatting, not data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It mainly defines exception classes with informative messages. No code performs network connections, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines custom exceptions for a library related to XML schema processing. All exception classes inherit from base exception types and are used to signal validation or structural errors. The string representations involve message formatting with class attributes, but they do not execute any untrusted code or external commands. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or malicious payloads. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of exception definitions aimed at debugging and validation, not attack or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is solely a collection of exception classes used for error handling in the pyxb library. There is no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It appears to be standard library code for structured error reporting.",
