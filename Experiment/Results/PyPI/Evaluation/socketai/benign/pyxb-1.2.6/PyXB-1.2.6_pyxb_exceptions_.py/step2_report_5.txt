  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior**:\n   - All reports conclude that the code is solely defining exception classes for PyXB, with no external input processing, network activity, file I/O, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code does not contain any obfuscated constructs, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n   - Exception classes are standard for error handling and do not perform any malicious actions.\n\n2. **Logical and Structural Analysis**:\n   - The code is a straightforward hierarchy of custom exception classes, with appropriate inheritance, properties, and string representations.\n   - Imports are standard (`pyxb`, `pyxb.utils.six`, `xml.dom`) and used solely for class functionality.\n   - No evidence of code that could be exploited for malicious purposes.\n\n3. **Scores Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0 or very low, which is appropriate because no risky behavior is present.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is only defining exception classes without any malicious logic.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is purely structural.\n\n5. **Consistency and Appropriateness of Scores**:\n   - The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n6. **Overall Security Perspective**:\n   - The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**My own estimate** aligns with the reports:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis code is a typical exception hierarchy used in a Python library for XML schema validation. It is safe and contains no malicious elements.",
