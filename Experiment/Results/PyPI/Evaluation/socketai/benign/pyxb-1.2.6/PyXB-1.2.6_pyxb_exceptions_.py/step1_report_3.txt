{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes for handling various errors in the PyXB XML binding library, including validation, schema, namespace, and binding errors.",
  "sources": "The code primarily reads class definitions, import statements, and exception handling logic. No input or data reading points such as file I/O, network, or environment variables are present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations. There are no network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly raises and manages exceptions internally.",
  "anomalies": "The code is mostly standard exception class definitions with docstrings and class attributes. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The import of 'pyxb.utils.six' is consistent with compatibility handling. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is present. The exception classes do not perform any side effects beyond raising errors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive hierarchy of custom exceptions for XML schema validation, namespace management, and binding errors. It imports 'pyxb' and 'pyxb.utils.six' for compatibility, uses standard class inheritance, and adds properties for error details. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network access, data theft, code injection, or sabotage mechanisms. The code appears to be well-structured for error handling within the PyXB library without any suspicious or malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of custom exception classes for a Python XML binding library. No malicious intent or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
