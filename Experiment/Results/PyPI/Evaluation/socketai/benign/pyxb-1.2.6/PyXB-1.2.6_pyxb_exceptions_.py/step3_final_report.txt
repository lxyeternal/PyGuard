{
  "purpose": "The code defines a comprehensive hierarchy of custom exception classes used within the PyXB library for XML schema validation, namespace management, and binding errors. It serves solely for structured error reporting and debugging within the library.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports modules and defines classes and attributes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as data leaks, network calls, or file operations; the code does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely class definitions for error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard for exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various exception types, with no dynamic code execution, no network or file I/O, and no obfuscation. It imports standard modules and uses class attributes and initializers to structure error information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The exception classes are used for error reporting within the PyXB library, and their implementation is standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of exception classes used for error handling in the PyXB library. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks.",
