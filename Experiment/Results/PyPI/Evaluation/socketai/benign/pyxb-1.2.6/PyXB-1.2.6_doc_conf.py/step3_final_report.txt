  "purpose": "This code is a static configuration file for Sphinx documentation build, setting extensions, paths, themes, and output options.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, os), configuration variable assignments",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data handling present",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static configuration with no obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or network activity. All imported modules are standard, and the configuration variables are static. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
