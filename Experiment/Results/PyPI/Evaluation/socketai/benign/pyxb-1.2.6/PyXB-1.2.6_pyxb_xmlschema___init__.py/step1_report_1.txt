  "purpose": "To provide classes and functions to process W3C XML Schema definitions into Python object representations.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'Schema' from 'pyxb.xmlschema.structures'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data processing, output, or untrusted data handling shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports a class and contains comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module with descriptive comments and an import statement. It appears to set up classes for XML Schema processing without executing or handling untrusted data. No functions, user input handling, or network operations are present. It is a simple, well-structured initial module definition with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module definition intended for XML Schema processing. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks in this fragment.",
