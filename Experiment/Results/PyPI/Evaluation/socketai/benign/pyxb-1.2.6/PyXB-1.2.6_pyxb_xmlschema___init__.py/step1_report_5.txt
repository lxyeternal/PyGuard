  "purpose": "The code provides classes and documentation to process W3C XML Schema definitions into Python objects.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'Schema' class from 'pyxb.xmlschema.structures'. No external data input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code primarily defines a class import and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The module contains only comments, import statements, and no dynamic code execution or malicious constructs. It appears to be a standard part of a package for XML schema processing. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The import is from a known library ('pyxb'), and the code functions as a documentation and setup snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a documentation and class import for schema processing. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security issues are detected.",
