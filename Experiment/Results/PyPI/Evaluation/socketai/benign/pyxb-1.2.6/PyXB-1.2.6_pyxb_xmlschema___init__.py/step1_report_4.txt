  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions to process W3C XML Schema definitions into Python object representations.",
  "sources": "Imports 'Schema' class from 'pyxb.xmlschema.structures'. No other data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data, code execution, or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily defines imports and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is largely boilerplate, with no signs of unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. No dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of module-level documentation, import statements, and comments. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic behavior. The import from 'pyxb.xmlschema.structures' is standard and used for schema processing. No malicious behaviors or security issues are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a support module for XML schema processing. No anomalies, malware, or security threats detected.",
