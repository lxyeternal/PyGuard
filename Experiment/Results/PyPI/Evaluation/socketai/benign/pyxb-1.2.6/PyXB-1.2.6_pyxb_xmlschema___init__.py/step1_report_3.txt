  "purpose": "To provide classes and functions for processing W3C XML Schema definitions into Python objects.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'Schema' from 'pyxb.xmlschema.structures'",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; no input or output handling shown",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are demonstrated in this fragment; only a class alias import",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code; minimal code structure",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a module docstring and an import statement. It does not process or handle untrusted data directly. The import references a third-party library ('pyxb') which is a standard XML Schema processing library. There are no functions, input handling, or data flows indicating malicious activity. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign module setup for XML Schema processing with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
