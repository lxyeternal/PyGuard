  "purpose": "To provide classes and functions to process and represent W3C XML Schema definitions in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports 'Schema' class from 'pyxb.xmlschema.structures'. No input data reading or external data sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not perform data output, network operations, or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; code mainly defines imports and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with only import statements and comments; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module header with import statement and comments describing its purpose. It does not include any executable logic, user input handling, or external data processing. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The import appears to be standard for XML schema processing within the context of pyxb library usage.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module header intended for XML schema processing, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
