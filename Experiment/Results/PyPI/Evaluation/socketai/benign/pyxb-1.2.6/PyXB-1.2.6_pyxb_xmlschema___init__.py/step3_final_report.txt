{
  "purpose": "Support processing W3C XML Schema definitions into Python object representations.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from pyxb.xmlschema.structures import Schema as schema'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in the code",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and documentation",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module with descriptive comments and a single import statement from a trusted library. It contains no functions, data processing, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The import from 'pyxb' is standard for XML schema handling. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and reliance on a known library suggest a benign purpose. The absence of any data flow or untrusted input reduces the risk profile significantly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup module for XML schema processing with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, reflecting the code's harmless nature.",
