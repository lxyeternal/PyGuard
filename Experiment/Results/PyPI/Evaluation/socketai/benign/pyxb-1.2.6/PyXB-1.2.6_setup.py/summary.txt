  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup and testing script for the PyXB package. No malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident. The use of dynamic eval and compile is standard in test harnesses but should be used cautiously if test files are untrusted. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.15, reflecting the minimal inherent risk of dynamic code execution in a controlled environment."
