  "purpose": "Defines classes and infrastructure for handling XML namespaces, including creation, management, and resolution of namespace components, as well as loading from archives and schema validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from pyxb, pyxb.utils.utility, pyxb.namespace.archive, pyxb.namespace.resolution, and xml.dom; class methods and attributes reading namespace URIs, local names, schema components, and archive data.",
  "sinks": "Methods accessing or manipulating namespace URIs, local names, or DOM nodes; potential points for malicious data injection via DOM nodes or untrusted inputs affecting namespace resolution.",
  "flows": "Input DOM nodes or string URIs -> creation/lookup of ExpandedName or Namespace instances -> methods accessing namespace URIs/local names -> potential data leakage or malformed namespace resolution if inputs are untrusted.",
  "anomalies": "Use of extensive dynamic attributes (__namespace, __uri, etc.) and class-level registries for singleton management; no explicit hardcoded credentials or secrets; dynamic loading of schemas and components; no suspicious hardcoded URLs or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive and well-structured implementation of namespace management, including singleton handling for namespace instances, archive loading, schema validation, and component registration. No code injection, network operations, or suspicious external connections are present. The dynamic attribute access (__getattr__) is for resolving namespace components, not malicious. The only potential concern is if DOM nodes are untrusted, but the code correctly checks node types and localName/namespaceURI before processing. The registry and singleton patterns are standard and do not pose malicious risks. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or privacy-violating behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of XML namespace management for a Python library, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It manages namespace instances, schema components, and archives securely and transparently. The overall security risk is low.",
