  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform a specific task related to data processing or automation, but without the actual code, this cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Data sources are typically from input functions, environment variables, or external files. However, no specific input sources can be identified without the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or command executions, but none can be confirmed without actual code content.",
  "flows": "Source-to-sink paths cannot be established without the code details.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected due to lack of code content. Cannot determine if there are hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information to perform a detailed step-by-step analysis. The code content is missing; thus, source, sink, and flow analysis cannot be conducted. No anomalies can be identified without actual code.",
  "conclusion": "No code provided for review. Cannot determine malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The analysis is inconclusive due to absence of code.",
