  "purpose": "Middleware to ensure all HTTP requests have a unique Request ID header, for tracing and logging purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads from environment variables ('REQUEST_ID_UNIQUE_VALUE_PREFIX') and incoming HTTP headers ('X-Request-ID').",
  "sinks": "Sets and modifies the environment variable 'HTTP_X_REQUEST_ID' and appends headers to HTTP responses.",
  "flows": "Input header 'X-Request-ID' -> check and possibly append UUID or prefix-based ID -> set environment variable -> include in response headers.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is standard middleware logic. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard request ID middleware for Flask applications, generating UUID v4 IDs when necessary, and handling pre-existing IDs with a prefix check. It uses UUIDs, environment variables, and standard header processing, with no signs of malicious behavior. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden logic are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign middleware component for Flask apps, designed to manage request IDs for tracing. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
