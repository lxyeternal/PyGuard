  "purpose": "Middleware for managing and ensuring the presence of unique Request IDs in Flask HTTP requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Reads HTTP request headers ('HTTP_X_REQUEST_ID'), environment variables, and Flask app configuration ('REQUEST_ID_UNIQUE_VALUE_PREFIX').",
  "sinks": "Sets 'HTTP_X_REQUEST_ID' in the environment, modifies response headers, and generates UUIDs.",
  "flows": "Reads incoming request headers -> checks for existing UUID or prefix -> generates new UUID if needed -> adds/updates headers in response.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code relies on standard UUID generation and RFC-compliant header parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Flask middleware class that manages Request IDs for tracing. It reads the incoming request headers, verifies their format and uniqueness, and appends a new UUID if necessary. UUID generation uses standard 'uuid4' method, and prefix-based checks are straightforward. No code indicates malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code's logic is standard for request tracing, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. No external or hidden behaviors are evident. The code is clean, well-structured, and adheres to common patterns for this purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a request ID middleware for Flask applications, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard implementation for request tracing, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
