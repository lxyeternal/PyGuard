  "purpose": "Middleware for managing and ensuring unique request IDs in Flask HTTP requests, primarily for logging and tracing purposes.",
  "sources": "Request headers, specifically 'HTTP_X_REQUEST_ID' from environ, and configuration value 'REQUEST_ID_UNIQUE_VALUE_PREFIX'.",
  "sinks": "Response headers (X-Request-ID), environment variables, and internal UUID generation.",
  "flows": "Reads 'HTTP_X_REQUEST_ID' header -> Checks for existing UUID or prefix -> Generates new UUID if needed -> Sets header in environ and response.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Usage of UUIDs is standard for request tracing. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns. The code properly handles UUID validation and prefix checks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a middleware component for Flask that ensures each request has a unique request ID, either by using existing valid UUIDs or generating new ones. It respects pre-existing IDs and appends new ones if needed. All data handling appears straightforward and relevant to request tracing, with no evidence of malicious behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate request ID management middleware with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely handles request IDs using standard UUIDs and respects configurable prefixes. No malicious or harmful behavior is detected.",
