  "purpose": "Middleware to generate and validate unique request IDs for tracking HTTP requests in a Flask application.",
  "sources": "Reading request headers ('HTTP_X_REQUEST_ID'), environment variables, Flask app config ('REQUEST_ID_UNIQUE_VALUE_PREFIX')",
  "sinks": "Appending to response headers ('X-Request-ID'), updating WSGI environment variables",
  "flows": "Request header value read from environment -> Checked/validated for UUID or prefix -> Potentially modified -> Response header set with request ID",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code present; code strictly manages request IDs without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Flask middleware for request ID handling. It reads incoming request headers for 'X-Request-ID', validates or generates UUIDs, and appends a request ID to responses. No hardcoded credentials, network communication, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code does not perform any unsafe operations like executing untrusted input or accessing sensitive system resources. It correctly handles environment variables and adheres to RFC 2616. The design is typical for request tracing purposes and contains no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate middleware component for request ID management in Flask. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard implementation for request tracking with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
