  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines a tuple `version_info = (0, 2, 2)`\n- Creates a string `__version__` via string formatting from `version_info`\n- Assigns `module_version = \"^0.2\"` (a version specifier)\n\n**Assessment of the reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, static, and involves no untrusted data, external inputs, or suspicious behavior.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious activity are detected.\n- The purpose is purely to define version information.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Are the reported issues present?**  \n   Yes. The reports accurately describe the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n   No. The reports correctly interpret the code as standard version declaration code.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - Malware: 0 in all reports. This is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated: 0, correct.\n   - Security risk: 0, appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is correct.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any malicious activity. The `module_version` string \"^0.2\" is a common dependency specifier, not suspicious.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly identify the code as harmless.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis; all are zero or one, reflecting benign code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward version declaration snippet.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior exists.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is entirely benign, standard version declaration code, with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, and the current scoring reflects that. No changes are necessary.",
