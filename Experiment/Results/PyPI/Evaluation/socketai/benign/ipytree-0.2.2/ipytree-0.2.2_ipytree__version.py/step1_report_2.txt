  "purpose": "Define and set version information for a Python module.",
  "sources": "The version_info tuple and string formatting operation to create __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from source to sink; simply constructs version strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The module_version variable is a version specifier, but it is common and harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a tuple with version numbers, constructs a string __version__ from it, and defines a module_version string using a caret (^) notation. All operations are straightforward string formatting and variable assignments. There are no data flows involving external inputs or untrusted sources, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to define version metadata for a Python module. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
