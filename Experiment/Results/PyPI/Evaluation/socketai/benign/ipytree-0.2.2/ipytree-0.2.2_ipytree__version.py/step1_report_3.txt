  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting with tuple elements is standard; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a version_info tuple with version numbers, then constructs a version string __version__ using string formatting. The module_version variable appears to specify a version constraint, possibly for dependency management. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are involved. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply defines version information for the module. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are evident.",
