  "purpose": "Define static version information for the package.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded tuple 'version_info' and string formatting to create '__version__'; assignment of version specifier string to 'module_version'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from 'version_info' to '__version__' via string formatting; 'module_version' is assigned a static string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and static, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a fixed version tuple and formats it into a version string, then assigns a version specifier string. It involves no external input, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior. The purpose is purely to declare version info. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or malicious activity are present. The code is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration snippet with no security risks or malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
