{
  "purpose": "Define and store version information for the module.",
  "sources": "The code reads a version tuple 'version_info' and formats it into a string assigned to '__version__'. It also defines 'module_version' as a string.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs, user inputs, or data leaks present in the code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining the version_info tuple to formatting it into __version__, and setting module_version; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; no unusual patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The 'module_version' string '^0.2' is a version specifier but not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a version tuple, formats it into a version string, and sets a version string for the module. There are no input sources, no data flows to sinks, and no suspicious constructs. The version string syntax is normal. Overall, this is a simple version assignment with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving to define version information for a module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
