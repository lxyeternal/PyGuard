  "purpose": "Define and assign version information for the module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version_info tuple to generate the __version__ string and assigns a version string to module_version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the version_info tuple to the __version__ string via string formatting; no external data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting with tuple elements is straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a version_info tuple, constructs a version string __version__ using string formatting, and assigns a version constraint string to module_version. All operations are standard for version declaration in Python modules. No external inputs, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is simple and adheres to normal versioning practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely to define version information. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
