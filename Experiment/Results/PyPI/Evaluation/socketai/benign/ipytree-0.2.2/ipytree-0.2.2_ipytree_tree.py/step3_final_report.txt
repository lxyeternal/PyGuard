  "purpose": "Defines hierarchical ipywidget classes (Node and Tree) for use in Jupyter notebooks, managing widget states and IDs.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters, generates UUIDs for node IDs, manages internal state via traitlets.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Internal data flow for node management and widget state synchronization.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; UUID generation is standard; no suspicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard widget classes with proper validation, UUID-based IDs, and serialization. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising patterns are present. Methods for adding/removing nodes include validation, and no external communication occurs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of ipywidget hierarchical structures with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
