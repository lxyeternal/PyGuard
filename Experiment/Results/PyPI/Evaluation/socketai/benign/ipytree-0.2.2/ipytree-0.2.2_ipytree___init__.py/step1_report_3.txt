{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions and imports modules related to a Python package, likely for Jupyter notebook extensions and version info.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules ('._version', '.tree') and the function '_jupyter_nbextension_paths()' which returns a configuration dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "The function '_jupyter_nbextension_paths()' provides configuration for Jupyter notebook extension, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info and tree module, then defines a function to provide Jupyter extension paths. All elements are static and typical for extension setup scripts. No suspicious behaviors or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration module without any dynamic or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to supply extension configuration for Jupyter notebooks. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are evident.",
