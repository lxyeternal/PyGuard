{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up version information and provide configuration for a Jupyter Notebook extension.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_version and tree), and a function that returns a static configuration dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the function only returns static data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the function does not process user input or external data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information and extension components, then defines a function that returns a fixed dictionary specifying Jupyter Notebook extension paths. All data is static and no external input or dynamic execution is present. The code is straightforward and standard for Jupyter extension configurations, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for setting up a Jupyter Notebook extension without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
