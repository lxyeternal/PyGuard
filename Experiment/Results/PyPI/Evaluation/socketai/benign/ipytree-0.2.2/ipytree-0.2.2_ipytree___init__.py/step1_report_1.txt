{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports version information and a tree-related functionality, and defines a function for Jupyter Notebook extension configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules ('._version', '.tree') and the function '_jupyter_nbextension_paths' which returns static configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or output sensitive data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and returns static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no hardcoded secrets, unusual constructs, or obfuscated code. The function returns a static list without dynamic or external inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information and a tree module, likely for internal use. It defines a single function '_jupyter_nbextension_paths' that returns a static configuration dictionary for a Jupyter Notebook extension. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, code execution, or data leakage. The code structure is simple and standard for Jupyter extension setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard for configuring a Jupyter Notebook extension with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides static configuration data without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
