{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module metadata, version information, and Jupyter notebook extension paths for an IPython widget or extension.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules and a function returning a static dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Importing version info and tree module, then returning static extension path data with no external input processed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information and a module called 'tree'. It defines a function that returns a fixed list of dictionaries specifying Jupyter notebook extension paths. The structure and content are typical for setting up Jupyter extensions. No data is read from untrusted sources, and there are no dynamic or obfuscated operations. The code's purpose appears to be configuration and setup for a Jupyter extension, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard setup code for a Jupyter notebook extension, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
