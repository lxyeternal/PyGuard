{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package, exporting version information and a function related to Jupyter Notebook extensions.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_version and tree), and the _jupyter_nbextension_paths() function that returns configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; the code does not handle external inputs or perform output operations based on untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The function _jupyter_nbextension_paths() returns static configuration data without involving any external input, so no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code consists of standard package setup functions and static data structures. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal version information and a module named 'tree'. It defines a function that returns a static list of dictionaries used for Jupyter Notebook extension configuration. The code is straightforward, with no external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated elements. It appears to be standard package code for extension setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package configuration code for Jupyter Notebook extensions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
