{
  "purpose": "Provides static configuration data for a Jupyter Notebook extension, specifying extension paths and requirements.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from a local module and imports a local 'tree' module; no external input or dynamic data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Static return of configuration dictionary; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information and a module, then defines a function returning a fixed list of dictionaries for Jupyter extension setup. No external input, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code is typical for extension configuration, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration snippet for a Jupyter Notebook extension. All signals indicate no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
