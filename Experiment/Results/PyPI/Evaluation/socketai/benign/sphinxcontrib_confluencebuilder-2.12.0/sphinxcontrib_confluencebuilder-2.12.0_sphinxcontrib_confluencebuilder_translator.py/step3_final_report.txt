  "purpose": "This code implements a base translator for converting Sphinx documentation nodes into Confluence markup, managing document structure, images, and unknown nodes.",
  "sources": "Reads from document nodes, configuration files, assets, and external files (headers, footers).",
  "sinks": "Outputs assembled markup into internal buffers, writes headers and footers, processes images, and encodes text.",
  "flows": "Data flows from nodes, configuration, and assets through processing functions into the final document body; images are fetched and processed; external files are read for headers/footers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or network activity. Warnings for deprecated raw nodes and file read errors are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard document processing tasks typical of a Sphinx extension. It reads input nodes, handles images, reads external header/footer files, and encodes text safely. No suspicious or malicious patterns, network activity, or code injection are present. Warnings are routine and do not indicate malicious intent. The structure and logic are clear and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of a Sphinx to Confluence translator with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
