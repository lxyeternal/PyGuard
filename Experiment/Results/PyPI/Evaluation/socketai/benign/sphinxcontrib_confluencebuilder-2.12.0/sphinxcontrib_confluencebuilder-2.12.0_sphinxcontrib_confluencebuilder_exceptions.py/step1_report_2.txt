{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling various error scenarios when interacting with a Confluence server via the sphinxcontrib.confluencebuilder extension.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, string literals, and import statements from sphinx.errors. No input data or external sources are read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks involving untrusted data processing, system calls, network operations, or data leaks. The code mainly raises exceptions with formatted messages.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to raising exceptions with detailed messages. No data from untrusted sources is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code solely defines exception classes with descriptive error messages.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception classes inheriting from sphinx.errors.SphinxError, each representing specific error conditions related to Confluence interactions. All messages include detailed explanations and are constructed with static strings or formatted with parameters. There are no input/output, network, or data processing operations that could be exploited. The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It is a straightforward error handling module intended to improve error reporting and debugging during documentation publishing workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely for error representation within the sphinxcontrib.confluencebuilder extension. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, nor does it process or transmit untrusted data. The detailed error messages aim to aid debugging without introducing security risks.",
