  "purpose": "Define custom error classes for handling various Confluence-related errors in a Sphinx extension.",
  "sources": "Constants for error messages, class initializers, and super().__init__ calls; no external or untrusted input sources present.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written or transmitted from untrusted sources within this code.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of error classes with fixed messages; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of custom exception classes for various Confluence API errors, each with predefined messages and parameters. No external input is processed or used in a dangerous manner. The code mainly constructs error messages with provided parameters but does not perform any network operations, data processing, or code execution. The implementation appears to be straightforward and focused on error handling within a larger application context. No signs of malware, malicious data handling, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists of structured error class definitions for handling Confluence API errors. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply provides error message templates and does not process untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
