  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of custom exception classes inheriting from `SphinxError`.\n- Error messages are static or formatted with parameters passed during instantiation.\n- No external data processing, network calls, or code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The purpose is purely to structure error reporting for Confluence API interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct, and the exception classes properly format messages with parameters. No issues with the logic or implementation.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None evident; the code does not process untrusted data beyond formatting messages.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No evidence of injection, data leaks, or backdoors.\n- **Malware score:** Zero, as the code is purely for error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes the code as defining error classes.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No untrusted data or external interaction.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — **appropriate**.\n\n#### Report 2\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the absence of data processing or external interaction.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — **appropriate**.\n\n#### Report 3\n- Same conclusion: purely defining exception classes, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — **appropriate**.\n\n#### Report 4\n- Reiterates the same points; no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — **appropriate**.\n\n#### Report 5\n- Consistent with previous assessments; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — **appropriate**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (error handling classes), the overall security risk is negligible; scores of 0.0 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Code correctness:** Confirmed, no issues.\n- **Malware:** 0 in all reports, justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, justified.\n- **Risk:** 0, justified.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores assigned are reasonable. No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a benign, well-structured set of exception classes for error reporting, with no security concerns.",
