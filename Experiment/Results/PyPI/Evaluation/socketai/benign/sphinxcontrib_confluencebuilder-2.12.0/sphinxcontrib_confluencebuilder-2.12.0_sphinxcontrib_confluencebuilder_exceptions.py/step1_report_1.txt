{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of custom exception classes for handling various error conditions related to Confluence API interactions within a Sphinx documentation extension.",
  "sources": "Class constructors (__init__) where error messages are formatted and string literals, including the error details and configuration parameters passed as arguments.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__() calls passing formatted error messages; no untrusted input is explicitly used as code execution or external data handling. Error messages are static or based on input parameters, with no indication of data leakage or injection.",
  "flows": "Errors are raised with descriptive messages based on specific conditions; the code primarily raises exceptions rather than processing untrusted data flows. No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code is standard for exception class definitions with no obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception classes inheriting from SphinxError, each representing specific Confluence-related error scenarios. The constructors format detailed error messages using parameters passed during exception instantiation. There are no dynamic code execution, data handling from untrusted sources, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to serve as a structured way to report errors rather than executing any malicious or harmful logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured set of custom exception classes designed for error reporting in a Confluence integration extension for Sphinx. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It functions solely for error handling and messaging.",
