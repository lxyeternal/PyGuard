  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided source code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a set of custom exception classes for handling various Confluence API errors.\n   - All error messages are static or formatted with input parameters; no untrusted data is executed or processed in a way that could cause code injection or leakage.\n   - No network, file, or system operations are performed here.\n   - The code is purely for error reporting and categorization.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - They accurately note that the code is primarily defining exception classes with descriptive messages.\n   - No logical flaws or security issues are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or 0.5 at most.\n   - Given the code's nature, these scores are appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions or risky operations.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores are consistent with the code's function.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely for error messaging and exception handling, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The malware score should remain at 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score should be 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The overall security risk is negligible.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as non-malicious.\n   - They do not suggest any vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, well-structured set of exception classes used for error handling in a Confluence integration context. It does not pose any security threat, does not contain malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
