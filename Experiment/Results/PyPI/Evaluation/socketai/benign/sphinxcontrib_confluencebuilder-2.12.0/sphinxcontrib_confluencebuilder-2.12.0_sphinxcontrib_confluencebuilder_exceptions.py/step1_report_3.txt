  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors related to Confluence integration within a Sphinx documentation build process.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or untrusted input reading. All data comes from parameters to exception constructors or hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leaks. No network, file, or system operations are performed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks. The code only raises exceptions with formatted messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. The code only contains exception class definitions and string formatting for error messages.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Confluence errors, each providing descriptive error messages. There is no logic, data processing, or external interaction beyond exception message formatting. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code serves as a structured way to handle errors in a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign set of exception classes intended for error handling in a Confluence plugin or integration. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks. The purpose is purely to organize error messaging. Overall security risk is negligible.",
