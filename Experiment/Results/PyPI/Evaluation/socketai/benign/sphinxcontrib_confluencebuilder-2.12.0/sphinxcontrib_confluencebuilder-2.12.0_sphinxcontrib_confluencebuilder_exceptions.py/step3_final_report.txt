{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes for handling various errors related to Confluence API interactions within a Sphinx extension, primarily for error reporting and categorization.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters during exception instantiation, such as URLs, error codes, page IDs, and details, used solely for formatting error messages.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or effects; the code does not process or execute untrusted data beyond message formatting.",
  "flows": "The data flows from parameters passed during exception creation into formatted error messages; no external data or untrusted input is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward class definitions for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple exception class definitions with formatted messages, using parameters only for descriptive purposes. It does not perform any network, file, or system operations, nor does it process untrusted data in a risky manner. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as structured error handling for a Confluence integration. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
