  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to determine if the issues are present, assess the reasoning, and verify the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a set of custom exception classes for handling various Confluence API errors.\n- The implementation involves string formatting and raising exceptions with detailed messages.\n- No external data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- The error messages include parameters passed during instantiation, but these are controlled and used only for descriptive purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. It is purely for error handling and messaging.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **No logical flaws** are evident. The exception classes are straightforward, with no complex logic or risky behavior.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0.5 or below, which is reasonable given the nature of the code. Since it only defines exception classes, the security risk is negligible.\n\n### Specific points:\n- **High risk scores (>0.5):** None assigned, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware scores:** Correctly set to 0, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Correctly set to 0, no obfuscation.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about external data or untrusted input processing beyond exception message formatting, which is safe.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with their conclusions and scores.\n- The detailed reasoning aligns with the code's actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (negligible security risk, only error messaging)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, well-structured set of exception classes used for error reporting in a Confluence integration context. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are appropriate, and there are no hidden security concerns. The code is safe and purely for structured error handling.",
