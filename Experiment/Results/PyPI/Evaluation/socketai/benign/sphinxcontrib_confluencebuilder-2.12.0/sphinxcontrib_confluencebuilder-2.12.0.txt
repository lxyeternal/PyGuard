It employs standard practices for path resolution, deduplication, and metadata tracking. The security risk is very low, primarily related to path sanitization, which appears to be handled appropriately. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk."
