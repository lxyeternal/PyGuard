  "purpose": "A Sphinx extension that merges multiple documents into a single Confluence page, handling references, numbering, and doctree assembly.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data, environment doctrees, and reference nodes within the doctree.",
  "sinks": "Modifies 'refuri' and 'refid' attributes in reference nodes to fix internal links; updates numbering dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Source: reference nodes and doctree data; Sink: 'refuri'/'refid' attributes and numbering dictionaries; Flow: references are adjusted during '_fix_refuris' and '_inline_all_toctrees' methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation; exception handling is broad but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard document processing tasks typical for a Sphinx extension, including deep copying doctrees, updating IDs to prevent conflicts, fixing internal references, and merging toctrees. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no external network calls or credential handling. The reference fixing logic only adjusts internal references, and the exception handling around toctree inlining is broad but typical. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose aligns with legitimate document assembly, and the logic is straightforward and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Sphinx extension for merging documents into a single Confluence page. It manipulates references and IDs securely, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
