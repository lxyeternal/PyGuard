  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as defining custom reStructuredText node classes for Confluence macro content management.\n- They emphasize that the code is purely structural, with no external data sources, sinks, or data flows involving untrusted input.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, with negligible security risks.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating a strong consensus.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** read external input, perform network operations, or write to outputs.\n- The classes and functions are straightforward, primarily managing internal data structures.\n- The `confluence_parameters_fetch` function simply retrieves a dictionary from node attributes.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors, security flaws, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of class definitions for documentation nodes.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign a very low or zero risk score, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- Report 4 assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1, slightly higher than others, but still negligible and justified given the code's nature. This minor deviation is acceptable but could be standardized to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (or very close to zero)\n- **Justification:** The code is purely structural, with no external data handling, no dynamic execution, and no malicious patterns. It functions as part of a documentation extension, which is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, safe set of class definitions for managing Confluence macro nodes within a documentation system. There are no signs of supply chain threats, malware, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across all reports.",
