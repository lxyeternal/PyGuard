{
  "purpose": "Define custom node classes and utility functions for managing Confluence macro content within a reStructuredText/Sphinx environment.",
  "sources": "Importing 'nodes' from 'docutils', usage of class constructors, attribute setting and retrieval within node classes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any untrusted input handling, network operations, or data output functions that could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious code.",
  "flows": "N/A, the code primarily defines data structures and a simple attribute fetch function without data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code is standard class and function definitions for a markup extension.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom node classes for use with docutils and Sphinx, focusing on Confluence macro content representation. The classes extend existing docutils nodes, with no dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity. The only function provided retrieves a parameters dictionary from a node's attributes. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated logic, or security risks in these definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of class definitions for structuring Confluence content in a documentation system. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious patterns, or security risks present. It appears to be part of a legitimate documentation extension, with no indicators of malware or security threats.",
