  "purpose": "Define custom reStructuredText node classes for Confluence macro support in documentation building.",
  "sources": "Import of 'nodes' from 'docutils'. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No clear sink points for untrusted data or untrusted code execution. The code mainly defines data structures.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows involving external or untrusted input that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected. The code consists of class definitions and a utility function.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines a series of custom node classes extending 'docutils' nodes, intended for documentation macros. It includes a helper function to retrieve stored parameters. No user input, network communication, file I/O, or dynamic code execution is present. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The structure and content are consistent with standard documentation node definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of class definitions for custom documentation nodes with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any dangerous operations, contain hardcoded secrets, or facilitate malicious activities.",
