{
  "purpose": "Defines custom node classes and helper functions for managing Confluence macro content within a documentation build process.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'docutils' library; class constructors; the 'confluence_parameters_fetch' function reading node attributes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no data processing, external communications, or storage present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily creates and manages in-memory data structures (nodes and their attributes); no external data flow or execution paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code consists solely of class definitions and a simple attribute-fetching function without external interactions or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes for custom document nodes related to Confluence macros, all inheriting from 'docutils' node classes. It initializes node attributes and provides a utility function for extracting parameters. There are no external calls, no data transmission, or any code that would facilitate malicious activity. The code is straightforward, structural, and focused on document processing. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom docutils nodes for a documentation system. It contains no malicious intent or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
