  "purpose": "Define custom reStructuredText nodes for Confluence macro content management and facilitate parameter handling within those nodes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources; it only defines classes and a utility function for internal use.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that handle untrusted data or perform output operations, nor does it process external inputs.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely defines classes and a function for managing internal data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected; the code consists of class definitions, comments, and a simple attribute access function.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of class definitions for various Confluence-specific nodes used in reStructuredText parsing. These classes extend existing node types and add optional attributes to manage macro parameters. The function 'confluence_parameters_fetch' retrieves a dictionary of parameters stored within a node's attributes. No data is read from external sources, and no data is written to outputs or network sockets. The code contains no dynamic execution, obfuscated logic, or secret handling mechanisms. Overall, it is a straightforward, structural code module without security-sensitive operations or external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of class definitions and a utility function for managing Confluence macro nodes in reStructuredText. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be a benign component of a documentation build system.",
