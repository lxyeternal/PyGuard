  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code solely defines custom node classes extending `docutils` nodes, used for structuring Confluence macro content.\n- The only function, `confluence_parameters_fetch`, retrieves a parameters dictionary from a node’s attributes.\n- There are no external inputs, outputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be a benign extension for documentation processing.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Class definitions for Confluence macro nodes; no external data.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Benign, straightforward class setup; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same as above; no external inputs or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) despite no evidence of risk.\n- **Analysis:** The report emphasizes the benign nature but assigns a minimal security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0 — possibly slightly overestimating, but not unreasonable given the pattern of defining custom nodes.\n- **Recommendation:** Since no actual risk exists, lowering `securityRisk` to 0 would be more accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others; no external data or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n---\n\n### **Key points for scoring:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher in report 4 (0.1), but since the code is purely structural, this is an overestimation. The risk should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities or dangerous behavior.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, structural extension for documentation macros, with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, except for the minor elevation of security risk in report 4, which should be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious and non-obfuscated. The slight overestimation of security risk in one report can be adjusted to reflect the benign nature more accurately.",
