{
  "purpose": "Define custom node classes for Confluence-specific content in a reStructuredText/Docutils context.",
  "sources": "Import of 'nodes' from 'docutils', no external input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network, file, or data leakage points evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code mainly defines classes and a simple data retrieval function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward class and function definitions with no unusual or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a set of custom node classes for a documentation builder, extending Docutils' node classes for Confluence macro content. It includes a helper function to retrieve stored parameters. There are no external input sources, network communications, data leaks, or code injections. No obfuscation or malware patterns are present. The code serves as a structural extension for documentation purposes without any malicious or security-risk behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of class definitions for Confluence macro nodes with a simple attribute retrieval function. It does not contain malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. The overall security risk is negligible.",
