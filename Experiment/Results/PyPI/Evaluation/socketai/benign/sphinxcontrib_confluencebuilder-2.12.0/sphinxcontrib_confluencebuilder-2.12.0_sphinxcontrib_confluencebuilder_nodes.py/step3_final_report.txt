{
  "purpose": "Defines custom node classes for Confluence macro content management and a utility function to fetch parameters from nodes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from node attributes (specifically, confluence-params).",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; no data leaks or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The function retrieves a parameters dictionary from node attributes; no external data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions extending docutils nodes, used for structuring documentation content for Confluence. The only function fetches a parameters dictionary from node attributes. There are no external inputs, outputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and serves a structural purpose without any malicious or security-compromising behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and intended for documentation macro management. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
