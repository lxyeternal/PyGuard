  "purpose": "This code manages and tracks assets (images and files) for a Confluence documentation builder, including registering, processing, and building asset lists for publishing.",
  "sources": "Reading from nodes (image and download_reference nodes), file paths from node attributes, environment variables for environment and output directory, and internal hash and path mappings.",
  "sinks": "Asset hash calculation, filename sanitization, path resolution, and asset registration functions. No direct data leaks or external network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Source: Nodes in document trees and environment data; through path interpretation and hash calculation; to asset registration and management structures; ultimately to build and fetch methods that provide asset data for publishing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or unusual code structures detected. Hashing and MIME type guessing are standard. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors apparent. Asset management logic is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical asset management system within a documentation builder context. It reads asset references from document nodes, resolves paths, computes hashes for deduplication, and tracks asset usage across documents. The functions are well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or stealthy code. The use of standard libraries and functions (e.g., Path, MIME guessing) is benign. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic is present. The only potential concern might be if the hash or MIME detection functions are exploited, but they are standard utility functions. Overall, the code performs expected asset management functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate asset tracking and management component for a documentation build process. It does not contain any malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the analysis. The logic is clear, and no suspicious signals are detected.",
