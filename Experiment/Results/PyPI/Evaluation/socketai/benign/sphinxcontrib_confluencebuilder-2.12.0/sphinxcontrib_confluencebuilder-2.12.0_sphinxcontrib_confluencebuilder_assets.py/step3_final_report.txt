  "purpose": "Asset management within a Sphinx-based Confluence builder extension, including path resolution, deduplication via hashing, and tracking asset usage across documents.",
  "sources": "Nodes representing images and files, environment variables, internal asset mappings, and path resolution functions.",
  "sinks": "Local file system for path resolution and hashing; no external network calls or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Nodes are parsed to extract paths, which are resolved to absolute paths, hashed, and registered; assets are tracked and deduplicated based on hashes; metadata is stored for publishing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; standard sanitization of filenames to remove invalid characters.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard asset management tasks: resolving paths relative to document structure, computing hashes for deduplication, sanitizing filenames, and tracking assets across documents. It uses well-known libraries and functions without external network activity or code injection. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The hashing and MIME type detection are typical for such utilities. The only minor potential concern is path handling, but as long as 'find_env_abspath' is secure, the risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign asset management component with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It employs standard practices for path resolution, deduplication, and metadata tracking. The security risk is very low, primarily related to path sanitization, which appears to be handled appropriately. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk.",
