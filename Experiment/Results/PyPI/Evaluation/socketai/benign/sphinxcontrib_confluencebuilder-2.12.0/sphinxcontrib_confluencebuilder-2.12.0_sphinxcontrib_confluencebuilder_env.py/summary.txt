  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured cache management utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects minimal security concerns, mainly related to local file operations. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent."
