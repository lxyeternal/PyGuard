{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom ConfluenceWriter class for the docutils library to output documentation in text format.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, docutils.writers, and typing modules; creates a class with methods that invoke builder-created translators.",
  "sinks": "Method calls on self.builder and visitor objects, which could potentially involve untrusted data if builder or visitor are manipulated externally.",
  "flows": "Constructor initializes with builder; translate() creates a translator from the builder, walks the document, and sets output from visitor.body_final if available.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution detected. The code follows standard patterns without suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of a writer, mainly for formatting output. It relies on external objects (builder, document, visitor) which are typical in docutils extensions. No input/output handling with untrusted sources or network activities. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flow. The methods perform standard document processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward extension of a documentation writer without malicious intent or security risks. It operates within expected patterns of the docutils library.",
