  "purpose": "Verify that pytest_echo module's __version__ attribute is present and not None.",
  "sources": "Import statement of pytest_echo; access to pytest_echo.__version__",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Import pytest_echo -> check pytest_echo.__version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and attribute check",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module and asserts that its __version__ attribute is not None. It performs a simple version check typical in testing or validation scripts. No network activity, file I/O, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is minimal, clear, and follows standard practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward test verifying the presence of a version attribute in a third-party package. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores across all reports are accurate and justified.",
