  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the correctness of their conclusions, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Issue presence:** The code simply imports `pytest_echo` and asserts that `__version__` is not None. No malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n   - **Logic flaws:** None. The report correctly identifies the benign nature.\n   - **Conclusion:** Valid. No changes needed.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above, straightforward version check.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Logic flaws:** None. The reasoning aligns with the code.\n   - **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Issue presence:** Again, just a version check.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n   - **Logic flaws:** No issues.\n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same benign pattern.\n   - **Scores:** consistent with previous reports.\n   - **Logic flaws:** None.\n   - **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as others, no malicious behavior.\n   - **Scores:** appropriate.\n   - **Logic flaws:** None.\n   - **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple, benign test verifying a package version.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is present in any report.\n- The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and security risk at 0 across all reports.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Note:** The code is a standard unit test snippet with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No adjustments needed to scores or conclusions.\n- The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0",
