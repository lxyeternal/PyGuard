{
  "purpose": "The code imports a future annotation feature and a third-party library 'pytest_echo', then defines a test function to assert the version of pytest_echo is not None.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'pytest_echo' module to access the '__version__' attribute.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not send data over networks or write to sensitive files.",
  "flows": "The source is 'pytest_echo.__version__', and the flow is the assertion checking if it is not None.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs. It does not contain hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party module 'pytest_echo' and verifies its version attribute. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The purpose appears to be standard unit testing setup. No external data input, no data exfiltration, or malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple test snippet to verify the presence of a version string in the 'pytest_echo' library. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior risk.",
