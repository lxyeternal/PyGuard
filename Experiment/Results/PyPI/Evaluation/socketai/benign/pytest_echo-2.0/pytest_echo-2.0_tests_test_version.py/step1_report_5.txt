{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named pytest_echo and tests whether it has a version attribute.",
  "sources": "Import statement for pytest_echo and attribute access __version__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output functions present",
  "flows": "Import pytest_echo -> Access pytest_echo.__version__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code; the import and attribute check are standard testing practices",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of a module and asserts that it has a non-None __version__ attribute. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. The code is straightforward and does not include any obfuscated or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a basic unit test snippet verifying the presence of a version attribute in the pytest_echo package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign test verifying a package version attribute. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
