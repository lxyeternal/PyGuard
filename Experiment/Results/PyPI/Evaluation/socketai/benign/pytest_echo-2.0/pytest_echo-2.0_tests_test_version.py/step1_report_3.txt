{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple test script that imports a module named 'pytest_echo' and checks its version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'pytest_echo' and its attribute '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data influences system behavior or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "The source 'pytest_echo.__version__' is evaluated in the assertion, but no further flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module and verifies that it has a non-null version attribute. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, network access, or suspicious patterns. It appears to be a simple test case designed to verify package version, which is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test script with no malicious intent. It only performs a version check on a specific module, which is typical for testing or validation purposes.",
