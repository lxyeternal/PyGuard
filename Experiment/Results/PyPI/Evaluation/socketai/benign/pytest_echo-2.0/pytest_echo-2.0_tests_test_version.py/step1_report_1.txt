{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple test file for a Python package named pytest_echo, verifying that its version attribute exists.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ attribute from the pytest_echo module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "The source (__version__ attribute) is used in an assertion to verify its presence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module, pytest_echo, and contains a single test function that asserts the presence of a version string. It does not perform any network operations, file writes, or execute untrusted input. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward and consistent with standard testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test case for verifying the existence of a version attribute in a module. No malicious or security concerns are present.",
