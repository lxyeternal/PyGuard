{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be setting up future compatibility features and defining a version number.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of the __future__ import is common for compatibility; the version assignment is a simple variable assignment. No suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations from the __future__ module, likely for type hinting compatibility across Python versions. It then assigns a float value to a variable named 'version'. Both actions are typical in code setup and do not indicate malicious intent. No other code or logic is present that could pose security concerns or suggest malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of standard setup statements with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
