{
  "purpose": "The code imports a future feature and assigns a version number, serving as a minimal setup or version indicator.",
  "sources": "The import statement `from __future__ import annotations` and the assignment to `version`.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow or external input/output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement is syntactically correct; the version number 9.9 is unconventional but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a future feature and setting a version variable. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. The only point of contention is Report 5's claim that the import is malformed; however, the syntax is valid in Python 3.7+, and the code as shown is correct. The version number 9.9 is unconventional but not malicious. No data flows, no external inputs, no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The import statement is valid, and the version number does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is negligible.",
