{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set a variable 'version' to a floating-point number, possibly indicating a version number.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to any output or perform actions that could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code merely defines a constant value.",
  "anomalies": "The version number is set to 9.9, which may be unusual if versioning conventions are expected, but this alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature but does not specify which feature is being imported, which is syntactically invalid in Python. The line 'from __future__ import annotations' is incomplete or malformed, potentially causing a syntax error. The assignment of 'version = 9.9' is benign but could be used in version tracking. Overall, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The malformed import statement suggests either incomplete code or a mistake, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior. It contains a malformed import statement that would likely cause a syntax error. The version assignment is benign. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.",
