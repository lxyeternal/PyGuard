  "purpose": "Define a variable 'version' with a floating-point value 9.9, potentially for version tracking.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading present in the code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines a variable.",
  "anomalies": "Use of the future import statement without additional context; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature, which is common for compatibility or feature enablement, and sets a version number. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The minimal nature of the code reduces the likelihood of hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving likely as part of a larger module to specify compatibility and a version number. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
