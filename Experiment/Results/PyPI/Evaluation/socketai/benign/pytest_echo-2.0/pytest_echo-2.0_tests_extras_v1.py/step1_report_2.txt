{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set a future import statement and define a version variable, likely for version control or compatibility purposes.",
  "sources": "The source reads the import statement and the assignment to the variable 'version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from external sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, and the version number 9.9 is unconventional; typically, version numbers are in a standard format (e.g., 9.9.0). This might be a benign typo or placeholder, but it's unusual. The import statement is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature annotation support, which is a standard Python feature. The version variable is set to 9.9, which is syntactically valid but semantically unusual. No external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious behavior. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior detected. It appears to be a simple setup for future annotations and version tracking. The unusual version number does not indicate malicious activity but is noteworthy as non-standard.",
