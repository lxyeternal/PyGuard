{
  "purpose": "Define a variable 'version' with a floating-point value, likely for version control or configuration.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The use of '__future__' import suggests compatibility considerations but is not malicious. The 'version' value is a float, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a feature from __future__ for compatibility, then assigns a floating-point number to a variable. No external input, data leakage, or malicious patterns are observed. No suspicious behavior or obfuscated code. The 'version' number (9.9) is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving likely as a configuration or version indicator. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
