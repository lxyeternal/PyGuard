  "conclusion": "The code is a benign debugging utility that leverages reflection, with inherent risks due to dynamic module loading and attribute access. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or backdoors. The potential for misuse exists if untrusted input is used, but the code itself is safe for controlled environments. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a low to moderate security risk score reflecting reflection risks, and malware score at zero."
