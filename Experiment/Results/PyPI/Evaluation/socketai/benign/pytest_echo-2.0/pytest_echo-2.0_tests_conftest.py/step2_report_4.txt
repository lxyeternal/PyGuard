  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code presence and correctness:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as a minimal configuration snippet for pytest, importing `annotations` from `__future__` and setting `pytest_plugins`.\n   - The code is consistent across reports, and no issues with the code's presence or functionality are noted.\n\n2. **Potential issues, anomalies, or suspicious behavior:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, with no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, perform network calls, or execute dynamic code.\n   - The use of `__future__` import and setting `pytest_plugins` is standard practice for test configuration.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (high confidence in benign nature)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   \n   These scores seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n4. **Assessment of malware and risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious behavior, the malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The security risk score is also appropriately 0, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the reports.\n\n5. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - No claims or assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and well-justified.** No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, harmless pytest configuration snippet with no security concerns.",
