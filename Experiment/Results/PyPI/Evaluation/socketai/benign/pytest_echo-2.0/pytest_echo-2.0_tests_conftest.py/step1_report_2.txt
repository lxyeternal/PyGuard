{
  "purpose": "This code is configuring the pytest testing framework by importing annotations from __future__ and setting a pytest plugin.",
  "sources": "The import statement from __future__ imports annotations; assignment to pytest_plugins",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs are used; no sinks are present",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code only sets configurations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, setting up compatibility features and plugin configurations for pytest. It does not process data, perform network operations, or execute malicious activities. The use of __future__ import for annotations is a standard Python feature, and the pytest_plugins list simply specifies a plugin. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard configuration code for pytest, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
