  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal configuration snippet for pytest, importing `annotations` from `__future__` and setting `pytest_plugins`.\n- None mention any dynamic code execution, external data sources, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity is detected or claimed.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's simplicity and clarity.\n- The security risk scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is straightforward, with no anomalies, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors. No issues are present.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 is appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 is appropriate.\n  - Security risk: 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk justification:** Since the code is purely configuration with no external or dynamic behavior, a risk score above 0.5 is unjustified.\n\n### Critical points:\n- The code's purpose is solely to set up testing environment configurations.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- The consistent scores across reports are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe scores are accurate given the code's benign and straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign configuration setup with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis matches the current scoring and reasoning, confirming the code is safe and not suspicious.",
