{
  "purpose": "The code appears to configure a testing environment for pytest by specifying plugins.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from __future__ import annotations' and the assignment to pytest_plugins.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leakage or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "The import statement may influence future annotations, and 'pytest_plugins' sets up plugins for pytest; no data flow leading to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain obfuscated patterns or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a __future__ feature to enable postponed evaluation of annotations, a common Python practice. It then assigns a list containing 'pytester' to 'pytest_plugins', which is a typical way to configure pytest plugins. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors or obfuscated code detected. The code is simple and appears to serve a testing configuration purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration for pytest with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
