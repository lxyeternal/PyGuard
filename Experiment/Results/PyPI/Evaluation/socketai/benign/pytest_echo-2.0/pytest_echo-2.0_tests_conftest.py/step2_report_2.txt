  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a minimal configuration snippet for pytest, importing `annotations` from `__future__` and setting `pytest_plugins`.\n   - No external inputs, data flows, or sinks are present.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation is observed.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; the code is straightforward and standard.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1 across all reports, justified by the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - There are no claims of vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all assessments correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious activities, so high risk scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Consistency and Appropriateness of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No changes are necessary; all scores accurately reflect the benign nature.\n\n**Summary of my own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThe code is a straightforward, benign configuration snippet with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
