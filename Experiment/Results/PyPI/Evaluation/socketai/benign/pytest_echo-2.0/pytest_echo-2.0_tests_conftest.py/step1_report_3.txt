{
  "purpose": "The code appears to configure the environment for testing by importing future features and setting pytest plugins.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the source code file itself, primarily the import statements and plugin configuration.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks; no data is sent to external systems or processed in a way that could lead to leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing future features and setting a pytest plugin, with no data or untrusted input flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for testing setups; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a feature from __future__, which is standard for compatibility, and defines pytest_plugins, which is typical in test configuration files. There are no dynamic evaluations, network operations, or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for testing purposes, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
