  "purpose": "This code is a minimal pytest configuration snippet importing 'annotations' from __future__ and setting pytest_plugins to include 'pytester'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines a variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets a configuration variable.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a feature from __future__ to ensure compatibility and sets a pytest plugin list. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks. The code is a standard pytest setup snippet, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. All signals indicate benign, static configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest configuration snippet with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, and confidence of 1. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
