{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest test functions that manipulate environment variables and configuration files to verify plugin behavior and configuration parsing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables set via mock.patch.dict, configuration files created with ini and toml content.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks or network activity; data remains within test scope, only affecting local environment and configuration files.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are set temporarily during tests; configuration files are read by pytest; no external data flow or untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; standard testing practices used.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard testing libraries and techniques, with environment variables manipulated in a controlled manner. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate. The slight elevation of security risk to 0.1 in some reports reflects environment variable patching, which is typical in testing but not dangerous. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with safe testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate test code with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
