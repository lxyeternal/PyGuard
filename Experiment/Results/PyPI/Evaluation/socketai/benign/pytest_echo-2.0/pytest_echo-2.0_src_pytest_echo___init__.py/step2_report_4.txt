  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - The code only imports `__future__.annotations` and `__version__` from a local module, then defines `__all__`.\n   - No input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n   - The code is minimal and standard for package metadata.\n\n2. **Issue Presence:**\n   - Confirmed: No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n   - No untrusted data sources or sinks.\n   - No anomalies or anomalies that could suggest malicious intent.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Report:**\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature, correct purpose, and standard structure.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n   - No discrepancies or overlooked issues.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Malware: All reports assign 0, which is correct given the benign code.\n   - Obfuscated: All assign 0, which is correct.\n   - Security Risk: All assign 0, appropriate for such minimal, straightforward code.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is standard.\n   - No indication of supply chain risk or malicious intent.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The only minor point is the relative import `.version`, but this is common and not suspicious.\n   - The code's purpose is to declare version info, which is standard practice.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and follows best practices.\n- All scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at 0.\n- The analysis aligns with the evidence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided reports and code review, I agree with the current assessments. The code poses no security risks, malware concerns, or obfuscation issues.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis reflects the benign, standard nature of the code snippet.",
