  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the original code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm presence of issues in the code**\n\n- The code is a minimal module that imports `__future__.annotations` and a local `__version__`, then defines `__all__` to expose `__version__`.  \n- There are no untrusted data sources, no data flows, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior.\n\n**Step 2: Review each report's reasoning**\n\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, importing a version string and defining exports. They note the absence of malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. The analysis in each report is consistent with the code.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the scores**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code shows no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\nSince the code is trivial, with no external input, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The reports' scores are reasonable.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge assumptions**\n\n- The reports assume that importing `__version__` from a local module is benign. Given the minimal context, this is a standard pattern and not suspicious.\n- No mention of potential issues with relative imports, but in this context, it is typical and not malicious.\n\n**Step 6: Confirm consistency**\n\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- The confidence levels are 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign module for exposing version info.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scoring aligns with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
