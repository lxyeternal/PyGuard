  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code imports `__future__.annotations` and a local `__version__`, then defines `__all__`.\n   - No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for package metadata modules.\n\n2. **Issues or Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No signs of hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The import of `__future__.annotations` is standard for modern Python compatibility.\n   - Importing `__version__` from a local module is common practice.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward analysis.\n   - No report suggests any reason to adjust these scores.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Assumptions:**\n   - The code is very minimal; no dynamic code execution, no external data handling.\n   - The only slight concern could be the relative import `.version`, but this is standard in package modules and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n5. **Overall Justification:**\n   - The code is a typical, benign package version declaration.\n   - No evidence supports any malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct, no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the comprehensive analysis and the nature of the code.",
