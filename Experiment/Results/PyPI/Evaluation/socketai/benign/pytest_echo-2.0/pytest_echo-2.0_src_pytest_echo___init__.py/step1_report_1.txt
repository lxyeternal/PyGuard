  "purpose": "Declare the package version and define export symbols for a Python package/module.",
  "sources": "Importing __future__.annotations and importing __version__ from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from input to sink; the code only imports and declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature to enable postponed evaluation of annotations, which is standard practice in modern Python. It also imports the __version__ attribute from a local module, likely to expose package version information. The __all__ declaration specifies what symbols are exported when the module is imported elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code is minimal, straightforward, and consistent with typical package metadata modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign package metadata module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
