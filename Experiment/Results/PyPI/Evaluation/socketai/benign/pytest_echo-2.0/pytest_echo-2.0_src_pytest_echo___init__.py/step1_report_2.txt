  "purpose": "This code sets the environment for pytest by importing the version information and defining the module's export interface.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local version module (__version__)",
  "sinks": "None present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines module attributes",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior; minimal code structure",
  "analysis": "The code imports the __future__ annotations feature, imports a version string from a local module, and defines __all__ for module exports. There are no inputs, outputs, or external data flows, nor are there any malicious or suspicious constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and intended for setting up a testing environment. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
