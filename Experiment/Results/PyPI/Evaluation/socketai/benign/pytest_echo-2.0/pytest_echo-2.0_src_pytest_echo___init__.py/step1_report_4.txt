{
  "purpose": "The code sets the environment for pytest by defining the package version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__version__' from an imported module 'version'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data outputs that could leak untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code imports the version and exposes it publicly; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no suspicious or unusual behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward module that imports a version string from a relative module and exposes it. There are no sources of untrusted input, no sinks, no dynamic code execution, or other suspicious patterns. The structure and content are typical for a version declaration in a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving only to expose version information for the package. No malicious or security risks are evident.",
