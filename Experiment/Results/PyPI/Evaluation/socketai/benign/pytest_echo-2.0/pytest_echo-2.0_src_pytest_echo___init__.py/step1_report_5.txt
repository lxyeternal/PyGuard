  "purpose": "Define and expose the package version for use in other modules or packages.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.version) to access __version__.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "Import __version__ from local module; then expose it via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a version string from a local module and exposes it via __all__. It does not contain any input handling, data processing, or output operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The only potentially noteworthy aspect is the relative import, which is common in package code and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for defining package version exposure, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
