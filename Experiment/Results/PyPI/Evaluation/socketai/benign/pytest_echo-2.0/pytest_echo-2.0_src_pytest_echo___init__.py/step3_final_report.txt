  "purpose": "Expose the package version information for external use.",
  "sources": "Import of __future__.annotations and __version__ from a local module.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "Import of __version__ from local module, then exporting via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature for annotations, then imports __version__ from a local module, and defines __all__ to expose __version__. It contains no untrusted data sources, sinks, or dynamic code execution. The code is typical for exposing version info in a package, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and standard pattern confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for exposing package version information. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and the scores accurately reflect its safety. No modifications are necessary.",
