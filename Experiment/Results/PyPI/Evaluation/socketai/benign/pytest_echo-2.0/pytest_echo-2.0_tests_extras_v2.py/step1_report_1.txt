{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple function to return a hardcoded version string.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are used in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the function only returns a fixed string.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; function simply returns a constant.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__ to ensure compatibility across Python versions but does not perform any input/output operations or data processing. The get_version function statically returns '9.9', which appears to be a version indicator. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data leaks, code injection, or backdoors. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent. It simply returns a hardcoded version string without any external interactions or potentially harmful behavior.",
