  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a minimal Python snippet:\n     ```python\n     from __future__ import annotations\n\n     def get_version() -> str:\n         return \"9.9\"\n     ```\n   - It imports `__future__.annotations` (which is standard for forward references in Python 3.7+).\n   - The function `get_version()` returns a static string `\"9.9\"`.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues or Malicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no external input, data processing, or output.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or anomalies are observed.\n   - No data leaks, code injections, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n   - The code appears benign and serves as a simple version indicator.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Logic and Reasoning in Reports:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign.\n   - They emphasize the absence of external data sources, sinks, and data flows.\n   - They note the use of `__future__.annotations` as standard and harmless.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are present.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - The code is static and does not process external data, so no vulnerabilities are implied.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are justified here.\n\n6. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n7. **Overall Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - Given the evidence, the overall malware score should remain at **0**.\n   - The obfuscated score should stay at **0**.\n   - The security risk remains **0**.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is a trivial utility function returning a hardcoded string.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is benign, with no security concerns.",
