  "purpose": "The function get_version returns a hardcoded version string.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs. The use of __future__ import is standard in Python 3.7+ for annotations, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that returns a static string. There are no external inputs, outputs, or side effects. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be part of a larger module, but on its own, it presents no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply returns a fixed version string, possibly used for version tracking.",
