  "purpose": "A simple utility function returning a static version string.",
  "sources": "No external inputs or data sources; static return value.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; function returns a constant string.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with standard import.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__.annotations for compatibility, defines a function get_version() that returns '9.9', with no external data, side effects, or malicious constructs. The code is minimal, clear, and serves as a version indicator. No obfuscation, suspicious behavior, or vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1, which are appropriate given the simplicity and harmlessness of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
