{
  "purpose": "The function get_version returns a hardcoded version string, likely for identifying the package or module version.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; the code contains only a function returning a static string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present, as there are no untrusted data outputs or data processing endpoints.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since no external input or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal with no unusual constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__ annotations for forward reference support, which is standard for Python 3.7+; defines a simple function returning a fixed string. No external inputs, no data processing, and no complex logic are present. It appears to serve as a version indicator, a common practice in package development.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward with no signs of malicious intent. It functions as a simple utility returning a static version string. No security risks or malicious behaviors are detected.",
