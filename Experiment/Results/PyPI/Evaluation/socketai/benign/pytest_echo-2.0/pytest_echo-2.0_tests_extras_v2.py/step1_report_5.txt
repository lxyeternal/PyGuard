{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function to return a hardcoded version string.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static code with no data input mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code contains only a straightforward function returning a constant string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated patterns, or unusual code constructs detected. The import statement is a standard feature for forward compatibility but does not affect security.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of an import statement and a function that returns a fixed version string. There are no inputs, no external data processing, and no suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a simple utility function, typical in version control within a package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply returns a hardcoded version number with no external dependencies or malicious behaviors.",
