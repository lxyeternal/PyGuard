  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report in turn and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, auto-generated Python module defining version information for a package. It sets static variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple) with fixed values ('2.0' and (2, 0)). It includes a TYPE_CHECKING block for type hints, which is standard practice. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, and no suspicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is static, auto-generated, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. No anomalies, external inputs, or data leaks are detected.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign, straightforward, and standard for version info.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk):**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Any claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports base their conclusions on observable facts: static assignments, absence of external data, no obfuscation, no suspicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The code is a typical, auto-generated version info module, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The consistent scores of zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate.\n- The high confidence score (1) is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional considerations:**  \nSince the code is auto-generated by setuptools-scm, a legitimate tool, and only contains static version data, there is no reason to adjust the scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.**  \n**No changes are necessary.**  \n**The code is benign, with zero malware, obfuscation, or security risk.**\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
