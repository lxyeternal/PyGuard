  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The code is straightforward, auto-generated, and contains only static variable assignments related to version info. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data sources, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**  \n   All reports assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code's nature. Given the benign, static, auto-generated nature, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct. The code does not perform any operations that could be considered risky.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   Since the code is only variable assignments with no external input, no dynamic execution, and no malicious logic, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code analysis. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, auto-generated version metadata module with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. It contains only static data assignments and type hints, which are common and safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign.  \n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.  \n- Scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are justified.",
