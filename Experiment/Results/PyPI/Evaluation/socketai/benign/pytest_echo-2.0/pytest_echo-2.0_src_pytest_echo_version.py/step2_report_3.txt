  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is straightforward: static variable assignments defining version info.\n   - No user input, external data, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n   - The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` is standard for type hints and does not pose security concerns.\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and auto-generated.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The conclusion that the code is benign and has no security risks is justified.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed; they are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0.\n   - This is appropriate; the code is purely static metadata with no security implications.\n   - No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0.\n   - Correct, as there's no malicious behavior detected.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they rely on the code's actual content.\n   - They correctly identify the code as auto-generated version info, not malicious.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a simple, auto-generated version metadata module.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior is present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Final Estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. No changes to the scores are necessary. The code poses no security threat, and the assessment is accurate.",
