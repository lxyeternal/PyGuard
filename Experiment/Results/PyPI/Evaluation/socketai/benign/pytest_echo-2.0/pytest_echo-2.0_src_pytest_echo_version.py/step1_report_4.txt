  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm, providing version strings and tuples.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version and version tuple values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Direct assignment from hardcoded strings to variables; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version-related variables, assigns fixed version strings and tuples, and includes type checking constructs. There are no external input sources, no data leaks, and no malicious logic. The version information is static and intentionally simple, with no network activity or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version information module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
