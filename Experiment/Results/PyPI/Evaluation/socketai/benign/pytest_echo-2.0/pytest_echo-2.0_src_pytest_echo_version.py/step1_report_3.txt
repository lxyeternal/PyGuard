  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, including version strings and tuples, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it primarily assigns static values.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code flow assigns static version data to variables, with no untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual constructs; it is straightforward version information assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple versioning module generated by setuptools-scm. It sets version strings and tuples, with no dynamic execution, external data reading, or security-sensitive operations. The presence of TYPE_CHECKING block is standard for type hints and does not pose security risks. The code does not include any backdoors, malicious commands, or obfuscated code. Overall, it appears to be a benign, auto-generated version file for package management.",
  "conclusion": "This file is a standard, benign version information module with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is typical of auto-generated files used for package versioning.",
