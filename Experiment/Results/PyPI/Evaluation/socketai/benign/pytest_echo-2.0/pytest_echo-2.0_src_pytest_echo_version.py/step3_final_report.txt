  "purpose": "Defines static version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple) with fixed values; type checking block.",
  "sinks": "None; no external input or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version strings and tuples; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, auto-generated module setting version variables with fixed values. It includes a standard type checking block. No external data, dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified given the static nature of the code. The high confidence score (1) is warranted due to the straightforward, well-understood pattern. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
