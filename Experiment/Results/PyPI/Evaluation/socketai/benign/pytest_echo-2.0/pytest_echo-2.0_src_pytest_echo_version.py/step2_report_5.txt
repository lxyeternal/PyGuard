  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the details with the provided code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward, auto-generated version module.\n- It assigns static version strings and tuples.\n- It includes a TYPE_CHECKING block for type hints.\n- No external data, user input, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious constructs are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, static, and auto-generated. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  The reports do not identify any logical errors or flaws in the code. The code functions as intended for version info assignment.\n\n- **Scores and reasoning:**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which is consistent with the analysis. The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions?**  \n  The reports correctly dismiss any assumptions about malicious intent or vulnerabilities, as the code is static and auto-generated.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Is there any reason to assign higher risk scores?**  \n  No. The code is purely static, with no external dependencies or inputs. The version info is hardcoded, which is standard practice.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is justified. There are no signs of malicious code, such as obfuscated logic, network calls, or payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated score justification:**  \n  The code is clear and straightforward, with no obfuscation. The reports correctly assign 0.\n\n- **Any overlooked issues?**  \n  No. The code is typical for auto-generated version info, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 (correct)  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n  - **Risk:** 0 (correct)\n\n- **Additional notes:**  \n  Given the simplicity and the nature of the code, I agree with the assessments provided. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                               |\n|--------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0      | No malicious code, payload, or suspicious activity present. |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      | Clear, straightforward static assignment.                   |\n| Security Risk      | 0      | No external inputs, dynamic code, or vulnerabilities.      |\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign, auto-generated version information module with no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
