  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, including version strings and tuples, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version and version tuple values.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to data leaks or malicious effects; only internal variable assignments.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version strings and tuples to module variables, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward, auto-generated metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version-related variables with static values and employs a conditional for type checking. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be standard, auto-generated version metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, auto-generated version information module with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines package version details.",
