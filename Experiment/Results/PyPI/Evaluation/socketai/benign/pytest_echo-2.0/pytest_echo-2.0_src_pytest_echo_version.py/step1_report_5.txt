{
  "purpose": "Define version information and avoid tracking in version control for a Python package built with setuptools-scm",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and version tuples; type checking block",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external outputs; purely defining static variables",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "None observed; straightforward version variable assignments with no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines version-related variables (__version__, version, version_tuple, __version_tuple__) statically. It uses a TYPE_CHECKING block to define type annotations but does not execute any dynamic or external code. No input, data leaks, or malicious activity are present. The comments specify that the file is auto-generated by setuptools-scm, which is a common and legitimate tool for version management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard auto-generated version file with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines version information as static constants.",
