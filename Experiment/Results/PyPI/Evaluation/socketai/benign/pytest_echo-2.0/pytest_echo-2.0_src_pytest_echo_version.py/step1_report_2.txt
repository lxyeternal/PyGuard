  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; no sinks indicating data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version strings to variables, static version information setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, generated by a well-known tool, and contains no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version-related variables, uses conditional typing checks, and assigns static version data. It is generated by setuptools-scm, a legitimate version management tool. No dynamic code execution, data handling from external sources, or malicious patterns are present. The structure is minimal and standard for version info definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, standard version metadata setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
