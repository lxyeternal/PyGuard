  "purpose": "Check if a specified Python package is available for import, optionally raising an exception if not found.",
  "sources": "importlib.util.find_spec() to determine package presence; optional raising of MissingPackageError.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the function only performs a local check and optional exception raising.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (package name, throw_error flag, extras_name) influence the availability check; exception may be raised based on the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard library functions; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility that checks for package availability using importlib.util.find_spec(). It optionally raises a custom exception if the package is missing and throw_error is True. There are no data leaks, network activity, or malicious behaviors. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard Python practices. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The exception raising is a common pattern in dependency management and does not indicate malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to the exception handling, which is controlled and explicit. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is very low (0 or 0.05). The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility function for dependency checking. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified, with only a marginal overestimation of security risk in one report, which is acceptable given the context.",
