  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code's purpose as a utility for checking package availability.\n- Notes that the code is straightforward, using `importlib.util.find_spec`.\n- Finds no anomalies, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n- Assigns a malware score of 0, security risk of 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment appears accurate; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes straightforward logic.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The evaluation is consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) due to the potential for exception raising, but this is standard behavior.\n- Malware score remains 0.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Since the function can raise an exception based on package availability, it could impact application flow if misused, but this is typical for dependency checks. The low score (0.1) is appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar assessment: straightforward, no anomalies.\n- Security risk: 0, malware: 0.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Confirms the function's purpose and straightforward logic.\n- No anomalies or malicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is a standard utility function with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** The only slightly elevated score is 0.1, justified by the optional exception raising, which is a common pattern in dependency management.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious intent or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very low; the only minor concern is the optional exception, which is standard practice)\n\n**Final notes:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes needed in scores.\n- The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a simple, well-structured utility for checking package availability. It does not pose security risks or contain malware. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
