  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall code review:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward utility function to check if a Python package is available, using `importlib.util.find_spec`.\n- It optionally raises a custom exception (`MissingPackageError`) if the package isn't found and `throw_error` is True.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks are present.\n- The logic is simple, standard, and secure.\n- No external data sources or network activity are involved.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, straightforward, and standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0\n- **Comments:** The assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; confirms no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0\n- **Comments:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) due to the exception-raising behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Raising exceptions can influence application flow, but in this context, it's a controlled error handling pattern, not a security risk.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which is correct.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1 is marginally higher than zero, perhaps reflecting that raising exceptions could affect security if misused, but in this context, it's minimal.\n\n**Assessment:** The securityRisk score is acceptable, given the optional exception raising. It does not indicate malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The score seems reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the straightforward nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0\n- **Comments:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is standard, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0\n- **Comments:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **General Observations & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **SecurityRisk:** Most reports assign 0, with one (Report 3) assigning 0.1 due to exception handling. This is reasonable; raising exceptions isn't inherently risky here.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a benign, standard utility function.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The minimal securityRisk score (0.1) in Report 3 is justified, considering exception handling could affect application stability if misused, but not security.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security issues)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple, secure utility with no malicious intent. The scores assigned across reports are appropriate and justified.",
