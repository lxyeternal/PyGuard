{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for checking the availability of Python packages, specifically for logging purposes.",
  "sources": "The function reads input from function arguments (`name`, `throw_error`, `extras_name`) and from the importlib.util.find_spec() method to check for package specifications.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks where untrusted data leads to potential security risks. The only notable action is raising a custom exception if a package is missing when `throw_error` is True.",
  "flows": "Input arguments influence whether an exception is raised; the core flow is checking package availability via importlib's find_spec method. No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present. The code performs straightforward package availability checking.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility for verifying package presence using importlib.util.find_spec(). It includes error handling via a custom exception. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or secret handling. The code is clean, well-structured, and only performs package existence checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for package checking with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It contains no malware or suspicious behaviors, and the security risk level is very low.",
