  "purpose": "Utility functions to check the availability of Python packages for import, with optional error handling.",
  "sources": "importlib.util.find_spec() to check for package existence, input parameter 'name' for package name, 'throw_error' for control flow, 'extras_name' for error message details.",
  "sinks": "None present. No untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The function checks the package name provided as input; based on the availability, it may raise an exception or return a boolean.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed. The code uses standard library functions and typical control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility to verify package availability using importlib.util.find_spec(). It performs a straightforward check and optionally raises a custom error if the package isn't found. The implementation is simple, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function with no malicious intent or security concerns. It securely checks for package presence and handles errors gracefully.",
