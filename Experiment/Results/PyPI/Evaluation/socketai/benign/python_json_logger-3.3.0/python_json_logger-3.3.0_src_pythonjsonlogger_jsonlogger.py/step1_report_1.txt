{
  "purpose": "The module acts as a compatibility stub, providing access to deprecated names while issuing warnings for legacy support.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import path and executes a warning with a message about deprecation.",
  "sinks": "The warning could be considered a sink if it leaks information via logs or displays, but in this context, it is benign. The imported modules may contain sinks, but their contents are not shown here.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the module import and warning issuance to the import of specific names from submodules, enabling legacy access.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is standard for deprecation handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility stub: it issues a deprecation warning indicating that the module has moved, then imports specific classes and attributes from submodules to maintain backward compatibility. The warning is intended for developers and does not leak sensitive data. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. It primarily helps with smooth transition for legacy code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign deprecation stub designed to maintain compatibility while informing users of the module's relocation. No malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
