  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the associated code carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a simple compatibility stub.\n- It issues a DeprecationWarning indicating the module has moved.\n- It imports specific classes and constants from internal modules (.json and .core).\n- There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code is standard practice for deprecation handling and backward compatibility.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code issues a warning and imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or suspicious flows.\n- **Anomalies:** None; standard deprecation pattern.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; benign, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0.0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0.0 (correct)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 (possibly slightly overestimating; no real security risk here)\n- **Recommendation:** The security risk score could be lowered to 0, as there's no evident security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; standard deprecation warning.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0.0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0.0 (correct)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 (appropriate)\n- **Recommendation:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same as above; consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** All appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as above; the analysis aligns with the code's behavior.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same reasoning; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code does **not** contain any malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- The **malware score** should be **0** for all reports.\n- The **obfuscated score** should be **0** for all reports.\n- The **security risk** score is slightly overestimated at 0.1 in some reports; given the benign nature, it should be **0**.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 for all reports.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- The code is a straightforward, benign deprecation stub.\n- The reports' conclusions are correct.\n- The scores are mostly reasonable but could be slightly adjusted to reflect the benign nature more accurately.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my estimates:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | SecurityRisk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n\n**Final note:** No evidence suggests malicious activity or obfuscation. The code is a standard deprecation pattern, and all scores should reflect its benign nature.",
