  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by retaining access to old module names while issuing deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports modules and triggers a warning.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only issues a warning and imports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. The warning message indicates a module move, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script issues a deprecation warning about a module relocation, then imports specific classes and attributes from relative modules. No external input, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. The purpose is solely to maintain compatibility and inform users about the module move.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility stub with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply warns users about the module relocation and provides backward compatibility.",
