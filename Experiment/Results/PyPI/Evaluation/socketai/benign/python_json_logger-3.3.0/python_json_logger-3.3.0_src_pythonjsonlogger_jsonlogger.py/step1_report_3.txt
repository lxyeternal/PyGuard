{
  "purpose": "This module serves as a compatibility stub to maintain access to deprecated names and warn users about their relocation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only generates a deprecation warning.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or malicious payloads are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code solely issues a warning and imports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard deprecation warning and imports; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a deprecation warning indicating a module has moved, then imports specific classes and variables from other modules. The warning is intended for users updating their codebases. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious logic are present. The structure and content appear typical for a compatibility shim.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a compatibility layer with deprecation warnings. No signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation are identified.",
