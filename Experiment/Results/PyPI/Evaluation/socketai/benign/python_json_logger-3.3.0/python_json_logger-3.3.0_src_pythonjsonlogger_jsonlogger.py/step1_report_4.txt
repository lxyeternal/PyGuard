{
  "purpose": "The code provides a deprecated stub for backward compatibility, issuing a warning and importing specific classes/variables from other modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the warnings module, and imports from local modules .json and .core.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted input or data. No external data output or insecure operations are present.",
  "flows": "The flow is: warnings.warn() executes, then classes and variables are imported from internal modules.",
  "anomalies": "The code only issues a deprecation warning and performs standard imports; no anomalies or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a deprecation warning indicating a module has moved, then imports specific objects to maintain backward compatibility. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or system modifications. The warning is standard for deprecated features. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard deprecation stub aimed at preserving backward compatibility while notifying users of module relocation. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
