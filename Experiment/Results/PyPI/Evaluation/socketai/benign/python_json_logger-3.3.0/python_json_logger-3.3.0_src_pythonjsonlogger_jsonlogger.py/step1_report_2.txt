{
  "purpose": "Provide backward compatibility by retaining access to old module names and issuing deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data; only imports and warnings are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only issues a warning and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "The code issues a deprecation warning indicating module relocation but does not perform any suspicious activity. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the warnings module and issues a DeprecationWarning about the relocation of 'pythonjsonlogger.jsonlogger' to 'pythonjsonlogger.json'. It then imports specific classes and constants from internal modules. There are no data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The only action is a deprecation warning to inform users of the module change, which is standard practice for maintaining backward compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign deprecation stub meant for backward compatibility. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. It simply issues a warning and imports modules as intended.",
