{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a compatibility stub that issues a deprecation warning about module relocation and imports specific classes and constants from internal modules for backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code issues a warning via warnings.warn() and imports JsonFormatter, JsonEncoder, and RESERVED_ATTRS from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to issuing a warning and importing symbols; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and standard for deprecation handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple deprecation stub that issues a warning and imports symbols for backward compatibility. It does not process untrusted data, perform network activity, or contain malicious code. The warning is benign, and the imports are from internal modules. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate. The confidence in benign nature is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard deprecation compatibility layer with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
