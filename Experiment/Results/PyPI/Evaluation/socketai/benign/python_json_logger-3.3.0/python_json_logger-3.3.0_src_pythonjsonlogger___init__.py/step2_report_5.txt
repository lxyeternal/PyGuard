  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code only performs imports and defines constants based on package availability. No data processing, input handling, or malicious activity is observed.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is accurate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. These are appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No reason to adjust scores; the assessment is sound.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, the code is standard dependency checking.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues found; reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. Valid.\n- **Justification:** Correctly identified as benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; code is typical setup code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code only checks for optional dependencies.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. Correct.\n- **Justification:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, standard dependency checks.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All are zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a straightforward initialization snippet for a Python package, checking for optional dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary.",
