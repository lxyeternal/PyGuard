{
  "purpose": "The code sets up imports and checks for the availability of optional third-party packages.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'warnings' module and local package modules 'json' and 'utils'. It also calls 'package_is_available' from 'utils' to check for third-party packages.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, then calling 'package_is_available' functions to set constants, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses relative imports, which is typical in package development but not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs import statements and availability checks for third-party packages. The 'warnings' import is standard, and the 'utils.package_is_available' calls suggest checking for optional dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a typical setup or initialization snippet in a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard initialization segment for a Python package, performing imports and optional dependency checks without any malicious intent or security risks.",
