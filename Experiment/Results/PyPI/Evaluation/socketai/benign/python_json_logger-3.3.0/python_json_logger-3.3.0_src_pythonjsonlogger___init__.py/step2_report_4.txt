  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reported findings, and the scoring.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `warnings` from the standard library.\n- Performs relative imports of internal modules `.json` and `.utils`.\n- Defines two constants, `ORJSON_AVAILABLE` and `MSGSPEC_AVAILABLE`, by calling `utils.package_is_available()` for \"orjson\" and \"msgspec\".\n\n**Security and Malware Considerations:**\n- The code is straightforward, performing dependency checks.\n- No data processing, input handling, or data sinks are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- Use of relative imports is standard in package code.\n- The `package_is_available()` function likely just checks if a package can be imported, which is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All correctly identify that the code is a standard setup snippet.\n- No anomalies, no suspicious behavior, no data flows, no malicious activity.\n- The reasoning is consistent and sound.\n- The confidence score of 1 is appropriate.\n\n**Scores for malware and security risk:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0`, which is justified given the code's benign nature.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:**\n- The code performs no malicious actions. It only checks for optional dependencies.\n- **Recommended malware score: 0**\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n- No obfuscation detected.\n- **Recommended obfuscated score: 0**\n\n**Risk Score:**\n- Since the code is benign and performs only dependency checks, the overall security risk remains very low.\n- **Recommended risk score: 0**\n\n---\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The reasoning is thorough and justified.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Aspect             | Score / Comment                                               |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score      | 0 — No malicious activity detected                            |\n| Obfuscated Score   | 0 — No obfuscation present                                    |\n| Risk Score         | 0 — No security risk, standard dependency check             |\n\nThe code is a typical, safe initialization snippet for a Python package.",
