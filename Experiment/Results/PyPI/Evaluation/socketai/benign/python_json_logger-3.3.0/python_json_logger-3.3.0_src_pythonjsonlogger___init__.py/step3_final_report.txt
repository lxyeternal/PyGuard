  "purpose": "Check for optional dependencies 'orjson' and 'msgspec' availability in a Python package setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads the presence of packages via utils.package_is_available() calls.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "The code flow is: import warnings -> import local modules -> check package availability -> set constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard import statements and dependency checks with no malicious or suspicious activity. It uses relative imports and a utility function to determine package presence, which is typical in package initialization. No data processing, network activity, or code execution based on untrusted input is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup snippet with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
