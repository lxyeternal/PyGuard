  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims made about the code.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code performs standard import operations from the Python standard library (`warnings`) and local modules (`json`, `utils`) via relative imports.\n- It defines two constants, `ORJSON_AVAILABLE` and `MSGSPEC_AVAILABLE`, which are set based on the presence of optional dependencies (`orjson` and `msgspec`) using a utility function `package_is_available`.\n- There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling in this code fragment.\n- The code appears to be a typical setup routine for a Python package, ensuring optional dependencies are available for later use.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The reports correctly identify that the code only performs import statements and dependency checks, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No. All reports consistently describe the code as benign, standard, and safe, which aligns with the actual code.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0  \n  These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  No. All scores are 0, which is justified.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Since there's no malicious activity, the malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute code based on external input.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The use of relative imports is standard in package code.\n- The dependency checks are benign and typical for optional feature support.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores based on the code:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe initialization snippet for a Python package. No security issues or malicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No changes are necessary.",
