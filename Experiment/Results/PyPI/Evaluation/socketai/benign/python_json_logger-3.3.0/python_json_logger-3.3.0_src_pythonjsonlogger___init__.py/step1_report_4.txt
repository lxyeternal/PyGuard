{
  "purpose": "The code initializes module imports and checks for the availability of specific JSON libraries.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own imported packages, particularly 'warnings' and internal modules 'json' and 'utils'. It also calls 'package_is_available' from 'utils' to check for optional dependencies.",
  "targets": "The code does not include any direct data handling or processing; it only performs library availability checks. No untrusted input or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flow exists as there is no data processing or input handling; only library import and availability check functions are called.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard import statements and feature availability checks with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and custom modules, then defines constants based on the availability of optional dependencies 'orjson' and 'msgspec' using a utility function. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a standard setup for optional dependency handling.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, consisting of import statements and dependency checks. There is no malicious activity or security risk evident in this fragment.",
