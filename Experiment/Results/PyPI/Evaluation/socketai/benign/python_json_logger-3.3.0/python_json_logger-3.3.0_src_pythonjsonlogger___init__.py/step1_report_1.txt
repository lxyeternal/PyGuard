{
  "purpose": "The code initializes the module with imports and sets constants based on package availability.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports (. import json and utils) is standard in package code; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports warnings from the standard library and local modules json and utils. It then defines two constants, ORJSON_AVAILABLE and MSGSPEC_AVAILABLE, which are set based on whether specific optional packages ('orjson' and 'msgspec') are available via a utility function. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical initialization segment for a Python package, checking for optional dependencies. No malicious or security-risk behaviors are evident.",
