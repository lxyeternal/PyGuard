  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward initialization segment: importing standard and local modules, checking for optional dependencies, and defining constants.\n- No report mentions any suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The code fragment is minimal, typical for package setup, with no data processing, input handling, or data sinks.\n- The `utils.package_is_available` function is used to check for optional dependencies, which is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code performs imports and dependency checks without any malicious or risky behavior.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  **No.** The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Score Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified given the absence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All assign 0, which is appropriate for this benign code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- **Potential for higher scores?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, with no signs of vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports avoid speculation and base their conclusions on observable code behavior.\n\n- **Are the scores consistent with the report content?**  \n  Yes. The detailed reasoning supports the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, safe initialization routine for a Python package, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately scored. No further action or adjustment is necessary. The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the observed code and the detailed analysis provided.",
