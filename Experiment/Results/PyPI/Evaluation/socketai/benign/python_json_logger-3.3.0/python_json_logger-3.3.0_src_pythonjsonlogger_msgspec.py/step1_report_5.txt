{
  "purpose": "Define a JSON formatter using msgspec for encoding log records, with customizable default encoding functions.",
  "sources": "Imports 'msgspec.json' after verifying its availability; uses functions from the 'd' (defaults) module; reads log record data in 'jsonify_log_record'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks such as network or file operations are present; the code mainly serializes data.",
  "flows": "Input log records -> encoder (with optional custom default) -> encode -> decode to UTF-8 string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic default encoding functions; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs. The code properly checks package availability before import. No obfuscation or suspicious language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a JSON formatter that leverages 'msgspec' for encoding. It includes a default encoder function that uses configuration defaults, with options for custom encodings. The class constructor ensures safe package import. The method 'jsonify_log_record' encodes log records into JSON strings. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to perform standard serialization tasks with proper safety checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured JSON formatter for logging purposes that uses 'msgspec'. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It is safe with respect to supply chain security.",
