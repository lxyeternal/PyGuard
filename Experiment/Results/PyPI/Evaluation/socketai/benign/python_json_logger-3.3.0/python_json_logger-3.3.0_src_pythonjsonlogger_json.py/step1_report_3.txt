{
  "purpose": "Provides custom JSON encoding and formatting for logging, supporting various data types and integrations with the standard library.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (datetime, json, typing, warnings), application modules (.core, .defaults), and class methods that process data for JSON serialization.",
  "sinks": "Uses json.dumps for serialization, which could potentially process untrusted data, but no explicit sinks like network calls or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (log records) are processed through the jsonify_log_record method, which serializes data using custom default functions and a custom encoder.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code appears to implement standard custom JSON encoding/formatting without obfuscation or malicious logic. The only dynamic aspect is the flexible handling of data types via external default functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom JSON encoder and a formatter class that extend standard json capabilities with support for additional data types through external default functions. The logic appears to be for flexible logging. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or backdoors are present. The __getattr__ function issues a deprecation warning for an attribute, which is benign. All data processing appears to be standard and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom JSON logging support, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external modules for default functions, but nothing suspicious is apparent. It is safe and appropriate for production use.",
