{
  "purpose": "Provides a custom JSON formatter and encoder for logging purposes, supporting various data types including datetime, enums, bytes, dataclasses, and exceptions.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (datetime, json, typing, warnings) and local modules (.core, .defaults as d). No external input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Uses json.dumps as a serializer; potential for untrusted data to be serialized, but this is standard practice. No data sinks sending data externally are present in the code itself.",
  "flows": "Log records are serialized via json_serializer with custom default methods and encoder classes; no external data flow or network operations are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior detected. The code appears standard for a JSON formatter with support for multiple data types. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom JSON encoder and formatter, extending standard library classes. The custom encoder supports various data types through delegation to functions from the defaults module. The formatter configures json.dumps with optional custom default functions and encoder classes. All methods and imports are standard and intended for serialization, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic. No external data transfer, network communication, or suspicious behaviors are present. Deprecated attribute access is handled with warnings, aligning with standard deprecation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a JSON formatter and encoder with extensive type support. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to serialize log records securely and flexibly.",
