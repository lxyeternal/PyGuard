{
  "purpose": "The code implements a JSON formatter using the orjson library for encoding log records, with customizable default encoding for non-standard types.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, configuration defaults, and log record data for serialization.",
  "sinks": "The jsonify_log_record method serializes log record data into JSON format, potentially exposing log contents if logs contain sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Log record data → orjson.dumps → JSON output; configuration defaults influence encoding behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures or suspicious imports. The code properly checks for orjson availability before import. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard JSON serialization with orjson, utilizing configurable default encoding functions. It imports dependencies safely, checks for package availability, and applies standard practices for JSON formatting and indentation. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The security risk is minimal, mainly dependent on log content which is outside this code's control.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard JSON formatter using orjson with configurable options. It does not contain malware or malicious intent. The primary security concern is the handling of log data, which should be sanitized separately. Overall, the code is safe with no significant security risks identified.",
