{
  "purpose": "Provides a JSON formatter using orjson for encoding log records with custom default handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from . (local module), package_is_available function, and json_default function.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points include the jsonify_log_record method which serializes log records, possibly including sensitive data if present in logs.",
  "flows": "Log record data flows from log_record to orjson.dumps, with json_default acting as a sink for non-standard objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets observed. Use of package_is_available check and dynamic default function assignment are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes a JSON formatter based on orjson with custom default serialization functions. It imports local modules, checks for orjson availability, and provides a method to serialize log records. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The only potential concern is if sensitive data is included in logs, but this is a common logging practice rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured JSON formatter implementation utilizing orjson. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from the provided code.",
