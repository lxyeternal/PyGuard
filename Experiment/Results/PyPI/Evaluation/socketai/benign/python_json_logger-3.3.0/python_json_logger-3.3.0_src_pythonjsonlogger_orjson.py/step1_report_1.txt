{
  "purpose": "The code provides a JSON formatter using the orjson library for encoding log records in a JSON format.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration from the module defaults (d), importing orjson after availability check, importing modules core and utils.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not write or transmit data outside of JSON serialization, nor does it handle untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Input log records are processed and passed to orjson.dumps for serialization, with optional custom default encoding functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. Use of the 'package_is_available' check appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports orjson safely after availability check, uses standard typing and future annotations, and defines a JSON formatter class that serializes log records. The default function for non-standard objects relies on external default functions defined in 'defaults' (d), which are presumably safe. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors. The logic is straightforward, focusing on JSON serialization with optional indentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a JSON formatter utilizing the orjson library, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
