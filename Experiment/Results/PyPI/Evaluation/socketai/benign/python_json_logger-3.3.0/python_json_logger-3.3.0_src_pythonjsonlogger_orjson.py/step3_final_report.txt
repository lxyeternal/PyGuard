  "purpose": "Provides JSON serialization for log records using orjson with customizable defaults and indentation.",
  "sources": "Reads log_record object in jsonify_log_record method; imports orjson after dependency check.",
  "sinks": "Outputs serialized JSON string; no untrusted data sinks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Log record -> orjson.dumps -> JSON string output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with dependency check and default handler delegation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency validation, defines a default encoder delegating to external functions, and serializes log records with optional indentation. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. It uses standard practices for safe JSON serialization. External default functions are presumed safe; no network activity or data exfiltration occurs. The security risk is minimal, mainly related to potential sensitive data in logs, which is outside the code scope. Malware score is 0; obfuscated score is 0; risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, justified by the benign nature of the code and typical logging concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard JSON formatter utilizing orjson, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and all assessments are consistent with the code's functionality.",
