  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward definition of custom exception classes with no dynamic execution, data handling, or external interactions.\n   - No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code is static, simple, and follows standard Python conventions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign and purely structural.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The reports appropriately note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, aligning with the analysis.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - All scores are 0, so no justification needed.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could be considered risky or malicious.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - Correctly assigned as 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n   - No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No unwarranted concerns are raised.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a simple, standard Python module defining custom exception classes.\n- No security issues, malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the code's nature.",
