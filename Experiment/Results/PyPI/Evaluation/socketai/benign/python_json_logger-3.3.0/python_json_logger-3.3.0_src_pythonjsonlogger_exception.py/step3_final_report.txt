  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python JSON logger library.",
  "sources": "The __future__ import for annotations; class definitions with string-based type hints.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input or output, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Static class definitions; no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions for custom exceptions, with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or network activity. It uses standard Python syntax and practices. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The exception classes serve purely structural purposes within a logging library. The code is static and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and poses no security risks. All reports correctly identify its static and safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The confidence level is high (1). No modifications are necessary.",
