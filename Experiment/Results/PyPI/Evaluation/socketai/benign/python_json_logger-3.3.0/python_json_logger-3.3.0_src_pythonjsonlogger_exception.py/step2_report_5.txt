  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code Content Review:**\n\n- The code defines a custom exception hierarchy:\n  - `PythonJsonLoggerError` as a base class.\n  - `MissingPackageError` subclassing `ImportError` and the base class, with an `__init__` method constructing an error message.\n\n- The code includes:\n  - A `__future__` import (`annotations`).\n  - No runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or external data handling.\n  - No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code.\n\n**2. Report Summaries and Findings:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, static class definitions with no external data or dynamic behavior.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The purpose is clearly to define custom exception classes for error handling in a logging context.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.\n\n**3. Issue Presence and Logical Consistency:**\n\n- The code matches the described purpose in all reports.\n- No issues are present in the code.\n- The exception classes are standard Python practice and do not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n**4. Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. Justified; no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports. Justified; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 in all reports. Justified; no external interactions, data leaks, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**5. Critical Analysis:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are reasonable and align with the code's nature.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is purely structural.\n\n**6. Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is benign, purely defining exception classes.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The scores should remain as-is: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe and standard. No modifications needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores are appropriate; no adjustments necessary.",
