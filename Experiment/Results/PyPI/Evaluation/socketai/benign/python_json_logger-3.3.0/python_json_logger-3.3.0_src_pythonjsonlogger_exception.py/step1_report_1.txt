  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to Python JSON Logger, specifically missing package errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions and import statements, which are static and do not involve untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code consists solely of class definitions and import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are observed. The code is straightforward and follows standard Python conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. The __init__ method constructs a message string but does not perform any external actions or contain hardcoded secrets. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for error handling and class definition, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
