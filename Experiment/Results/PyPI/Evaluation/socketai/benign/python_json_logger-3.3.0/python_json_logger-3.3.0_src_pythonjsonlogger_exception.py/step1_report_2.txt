{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes related to JSON logging, specifically for missing packages and general logger errors.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data input sources are present; the code only defines classes and exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No sink points such as data output, network communication, or file writing are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares exception classes without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code follows standard Python class and exception definitions without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up custom exceptions for logging errors, particularly missing packages. It uses standard Python syntax and practices. There are no inputs, outputs, or external interactions. No malware indicators such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be purely structural and does not contain any malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only as exception class definitions for logging-related errors. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
