  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code is straightforward class definitions and import statements. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing.\n- No evidence of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign and purely structural.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is static, with no untrusted input, no data sinks, and no suspicious patterns.\n- They also correctly note the absence of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n- These scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since the code is purely for defining exception classes with no dynamic behavior, no external interactions, and no malicious indicators, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted.\n- The `malware` score is correctly set to 0.\n- The `securityRisk` score is correctly set to 0.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any claims based on assumptions**\n\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they only describe the static nature of the code.\n- No assumptions about potential future misuse are made, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure consistency of scores**\n\n- All scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified, given the straightforward, well-understood class definitions.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is purely structural, defining custom exceptions for error handling.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. No changes are necessary. The overall assessment aligns with the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
