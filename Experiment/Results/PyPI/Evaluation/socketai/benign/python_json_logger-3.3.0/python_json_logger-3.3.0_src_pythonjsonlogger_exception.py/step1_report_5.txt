  "sources": "Class definitions and exception initializations",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as the code only defines classes and exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; straightforward class and exception definitions",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, including a base exception class and a specific missing package error class. There are no dynamic code executions, data input handling, network operations, or sensitive data handling. It adheres to standard Python exception practices without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple, benign definition of custom exceptions for a logger utility. No malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code are present.",
