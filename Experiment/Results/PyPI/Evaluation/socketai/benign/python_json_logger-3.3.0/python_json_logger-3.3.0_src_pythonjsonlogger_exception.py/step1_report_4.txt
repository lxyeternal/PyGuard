  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to a Python JSON logger module, specifically missing packages.",
  "sources": "Import statements and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks; no output or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; straightforward class definitions with no dynamic or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a future import, standard library and installed packages placeholders, and two custom exception classes. The classes serve to handle errors like missing packages, providing clear error messages. There are no suspicious imports, no code injection, no data leaks, or malicious logic. The code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a simple, benign definition of exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It is typical in Python projects and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.",
