{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for serializing various Python objects to JSON-compatible formats, including dataclasses, datetime objects, enums, UUIDs, bytes, and exceptions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from object attributes, types, and classes during function calls, especially in 'use_' functions and the default handlers.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs serialized string representations, especially for bytes (base64 encoding), exceptions (string format), and datetime objects (ISO format).",
  "flows": "Input data (objects) is checked via 'use_' functions, then processed by corresponding default functions to produce JSON-compatible output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; the code strictly implements serialization logic. No network operations, system modifications, or suspicious side-effects are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple helper functions for detecting and serializing specific Python object types, ensuring safe conversion to JSON-compatible formats. Usage of try-except blocks in 'unknown_default' ensures graceful fallback when str or repr fail. No external inputs are processed directly, and functions perform type checks and data transformations without executing external commands or network operations. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of object serialization, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of utility functions for object serialization with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks detected. It adheres to safe programming practices and serves a legitimate purpose in JSON serialization workflows.",
