{
  "purpose": "Collection of functions for building custom `json_default` functions, primarily for serializing Python objects into JSON-compatible formats.",
  "sources": "Functions read data from objects passed as arguments, performing type checks and conversions.",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions output strings, dictionaries, or encoded data; no external data leaks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input objects are checked and transformed into safe, serializable formats such as strings, dicts, or base64-encoded strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns detected; code uses standard libraries and safe practices.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard serialization techniques with appropriate exception handling, type guards, and safe conversions. No external calls, code execution, or data exfiltration observed. Functions handle data safely, converting objects to strings, dicts, or encoded formats. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are justified based on the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility module for serializing Python objects into JSON-compatible formats. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious elements. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 or 0.1 are appropriate and justified.",
