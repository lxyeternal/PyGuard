  "purpose": "Collection of utility functions for serializing various Python objects into JSON-compatible formats, primarily for custom json_default implementations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters such as objects to serialize or check types of objects. No external input sources are directly accessed.",
  "sinks": "The functions return serialized representations of objects. No untrusted data is used to influence system behavior or cause leaks. The functions do not write to files, execute commands, or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The functions primarily perform type checks or convert objects to strings or dictionaries for serialization. There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks that could cause vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code is straightforward and primarily involves type checking and data conversion.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple type guard functions and default handlers for serializing common Python objects such as dataclasses, datetime objects, enums, UUIDs, bytes, exceptions, and tracebacks. It uses standard library modules like base64, dataclasses, datetime, enum, traceback, and uuid. The functions perform type checks and convert objects into safe string representations suitable for JSON serialization. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The use of base64 encoding for bytes and the fallback to str or repr for unknown objects are typical patterns. The code does not execute any system commands, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data such as credentials.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of harmless utility functions designed for serializing Python objects for JSON. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It appears to be a well-structured, standard implementation for custom JSON encoding support.",
