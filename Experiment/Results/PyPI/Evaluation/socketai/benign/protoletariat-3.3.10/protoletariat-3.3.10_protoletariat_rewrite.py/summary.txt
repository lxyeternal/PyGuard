  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured AST pattern matching and rewriting utility intended for import statement management and code refactoring. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minimal security risk score reflects the potential for misuse if malicious patterns are registered, but as provided, the code is safe and standard."
