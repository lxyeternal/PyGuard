{
  "purpose": "A utility for pattern matching and rewriting Python ASTs, primarily for managing import statements during code refactoring or dependency updates.",
  "sources": "Reads source code strings, parses into AST, and applies pattern matching rules; no external data sources or input beyond the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Converts AST back into source code strings; no external system calls, network activity, or data leaks involved.",
  "flows": "AST nodes are matched against registered patterns; matching nodes are transformed via registered rewrite functions; resulting ASTs are unparsed into source code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no covert channels detected. Functions operate solely on AST structures and source code strings.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured framework for pattern matching and rewriting AST nodes, especially for import statements. It uses standard Python libraries (`ast`, `collections`, `typing`) and performs no external system interactions. The pattern matching is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. The rewriting process is controlled and based on registered patterns, which could theoretically be misused if malicious patterns are registered externally, but the code itself is benign. The scores assigned in the original reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured AST pattern matching and rewriting utility intended for import statement management and code refactoring. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minimal security risk score reflects the potential for misuse if malicious patterns are registered, but as provided, the code is safe and standard.",
