{
  "purpose": "The code provides tools for pattern matching, rewriting, and transforming Python ASTs, specifically targeting import statements for code modification or refactoring.",
  "sources": "Reads source code strings via ast.parse() and input strings for rewriting; accesses module attributes and AST nodes for pattern matching.",
  "sinks": "Generates new AST nodes and converts them back to source code with astunparse, which could potentially execute code if misused with malicious input, but here only source transformations are performed. No direct data leaks or external system access are evident.",
  "flows": "Input source code -> parsed into AST -> pattern matching and rewriting rules -> AST modifications -> source code generation via astunparse.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs pattern matching and rewriting but does not include any obfuscated or malicious constructs. The import rewriting functions are standard for AST transformations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utilities for matching and rewriting Python AST nodes, mainly for import statement modifications. It includes functions for pattern matching, a class for registering rewrite rules, and classes for transforming AST nodes and source code. No external network access, system modifications, or malicious behaviors are observed. The pattern matching and rewriting logic appear to serve code refactoring or dependency rewriting purposes. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or malicious code injections are present. The functions operate purely on AST representations and source code strings.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate AST transformation utility designed for source code manipulation, likely for dependency or import rewriting. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in the provided implementation.",
