{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing and utility functions, likely to support a larger application or script.",
  "sources": "Input is read from the 'input_data' variable and possibly from environment variables or external files if used elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data outputs via print statements, logging, or network transmissions if present, but none are explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources into processing functions and possibly to output or storage points; specific source-to-sink paths are not explicitly detailed in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code detected. The code structure appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured with clear function definitions, no evidence of malicious payloads or obfuscated segments. It utilizes standard Python features and libraries. No indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access. There are no suspicious network calls, system modifications, or hidden behaviors. The absence of external suspicious interactions or code injections suggests a benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to be a legitimate utility or data processing module without malicious intent.",
