  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, but without explicit context, its precise purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input sources include reading from environment variables, files, or user input (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be network connections, file writes, or system commands if used, but no such actions are explicitly visible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., environment variables, files) to processing functions and possibly to output or storage locations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code segments are evident. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or misleading variable names observed.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain apparent malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or unauthorized system modifications. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard. No suspicious network activity, cryptomining, or backdoor behaviors detected. The code appears to follow conventional Python coding patterns without obfuscation or malicious intent. However, without context or complete code, some assumptions are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet and analysis, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. The code seems benign and aligns with typical utility scripts. Confidence in this assessment is high, but some uncertainty remains if additional context or code exists.",
