  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading from standard input, command-line arguments, or environment variables; potential network or file activity.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into network connections, file operations, or environment variables that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables may flow into network or file operations, or system calls, but no malicious flows are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected; code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently describe the code as benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious network activity. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are justified by the descriptions. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the absence of suspicious features. The limited context and lack of code snippets constrain certainty, but the assessments are reasonable. No anomalies or red flags are present. The overall conclusion is that the code is safe, with minimal security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the descriptions. No further action is necessary unless additional code or context reveals otherwise.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
