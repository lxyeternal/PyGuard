{
  "purpose": "The code defines parameterized test cases for the 'build_rewrites' function in the 'protoletariat.rewrite' module, to verify correct import path rewriting logic.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the 'test_build_import_rewrites' function: 'proto', 'dep', and 'expecteds'.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network communication, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to generate rewrites via 'build_rewrites'; the resulting rewrites are compared to expected values within the test.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. The code appears straightforward and standard for a test suite.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing libraries (pytest, itertools) and the 'build_rewrites' function, then defines a comprehensive set of test cases to verify import path rewriting logic for various directory and module structures. It uses parameterized testing to check multiple scenarios. The logic is centered on verifying that the rewrite function produces expected import statements for given proto and dependency paths. There is no evidence of data leakage, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities in the logic itself. The code is standard test code with no suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured test suite verifying the correctness of import path rewrites. It contains no malicious, backdoored, or suspicious behavior. The code is safe and focused solely on testing the functionality of the 'build_rewrites' method.",
