{
  "purpose": "The code sets up pytest fixtures and helper classes for testing protobuf code generation workflows, invoking external tools like buf, protoc, and grpc_tools in a controlled environment.",
  "sources": "Proto text files written to disk, environment variables for tool paths, and static configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to buf, protoc, grpc_tools.protoc, and CLI invocations via click.testing, executing commands with controlled arguments.",
  "flows": "Proto source texts are written to files, then used as inputs for subprocess commands that generate code; no untrusted input influences command construction beyond static test data.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs subprocess commands from static or controlled data, with checks for tool existence. Proto texts are static, and no untrusted user input influences command parameters. External tool invocations are standard for testing protobuf workflows. No malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess calls are safe, and the environment is controlled. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured test harness for protobuf code generation, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and justified.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
