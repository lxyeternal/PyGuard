  "purpose": "CLI utility for rewriting protobuf import statements and generating descriptor sets via external tools (protoc or buf).",
  "sources": "User inputs via CLI options, environment variables, and files (descriptor bytes).",
  "sinks": "File writes, stdout output, subprocess calls to external tools (protoc, buf) via classes Protoc, Buf, Raw.",
  "flows": "Inputs (CLI/env/file) → functions → external command execution or file output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that orchestrates external protobuf tooling. It reads inputs from user options and environment variables, then invokes external commands through class interfaces, which are assumed to handle subprocess execution safely. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main security consideration is the reliance on external tools and passing untrusted data to subprocesses, which is a known supply chain risk but not an inherent flaw. The code structure and logic are standard, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, purpose-specific CLI utility for protobuf import rewriting and descriptor generation. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The external command invocation poses a minimal, manageable security risk. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in a supply chain context, assuming external tools are trusted.",
