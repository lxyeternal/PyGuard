  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal module header or metadata declaration for a protocol buffers package, including a version string and a future import for annotations.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' assignment and the import statement 'from __future__ import annotations'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or handle external or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input/output operations, or data processing paths present.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static module header containing a docstring, a future import, and a version string. No executable logic, data handling, or external interactions are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward analysis. No anomalies or suspicious activity are detected. The code's minimal and standard structure indicates it is purely metadata or documentation, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's simple structure. No further action or concern is necessary.",
