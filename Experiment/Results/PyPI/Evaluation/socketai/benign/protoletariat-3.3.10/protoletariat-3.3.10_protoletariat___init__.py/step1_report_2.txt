  "purpose": "This code appears to be the initial part of a Python module related to protocol buffers, likely setting up versioning and annotations.",
  "sources": "The only source of input is the import statement from __future__ import annotations, which is a standard Python feature to enable postponed evaluation of annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no functions, network calls, file operations, or data outputs in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this snippet since it contains only imports and a version string.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of a future import and a version string assignment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or unusual code practices. The snippet is a typical module header for a Python package related to protocol buffers, with no evident security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module header with versioning. There is no malicious intent, no suspicious activity, and no security risks evident in this fragment.",
