  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the claims and ensure the scores are appropriate.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code snippet: a module with a version string and a future import.\n- No executable logic, data processing, external input/output, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be a standard module header or metadata setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and evaluations:\n\n**Presence of issues:**\n- **Code content:** The code does **not** contain any executable logic, data flows, or data sinks. It’s purely metadata.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; the code is very straightforward.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is correct since there's no security concern.\n\n**Confidence levels:**\n- High confidence (1 or 0.9) is justified, given the simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues in the reports:\n- **Redundancy:** All reports are very similar, but that’s acceptable given the minimal code.\n- **Analysis correctness:** All analyses correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** No changes needed; they seem reasonable.\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:** None, as the code is harmless.\n- **Malware and obfuscated scores:** Correctly assigned.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, harmless module header.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's nature. The reports are consistent and accurate.",
