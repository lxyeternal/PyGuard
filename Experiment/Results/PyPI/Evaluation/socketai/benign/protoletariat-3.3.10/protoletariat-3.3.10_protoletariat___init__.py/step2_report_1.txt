  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement and a version string. There are no executable functions, data flows, or external data sources or sinks. Therefore, no issues such as malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. No logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis that there's no malicious activity. The obfuscated score is also 0, which is appropriate. The securityRisk scores are 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is purely a minimal header with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. All reports correctly assign a risk score of 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports correctly identify no malware activity, consistent with the code content.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nNo reports make unwarranted assumptions; they all base their conclusions on the code snippet provided.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n**Overall, the code is a simple, benign module header with no malicious or suspicious content.**  \n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is necessary for this code snippet.",
