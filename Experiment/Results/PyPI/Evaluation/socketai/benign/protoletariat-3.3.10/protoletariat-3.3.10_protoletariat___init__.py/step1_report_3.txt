  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard header typical of a Python module: it includes a future import for annotations and a version string. There are no functions, data processing, external data sources, or sinks present. No signs of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless module header setting a version number and importing future features. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
