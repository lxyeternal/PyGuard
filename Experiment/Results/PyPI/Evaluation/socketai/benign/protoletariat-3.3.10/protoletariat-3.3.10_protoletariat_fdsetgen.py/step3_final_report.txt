  "purpose": "Utility for generating protobuf FileDescriptorSets via protoc, buf, or raw bytes, and fixing import paths in generated Python code, including package structure creation.",
  "sources": "Reading descriptor data from files, subprocess outputs, or in-memory bytes.",
  "sinks": "Rewriting Python source files, creating or appending to __init__.py and __init__.pyi files, executing external commands.",
  "flows": "Input protobuf descriptor data -> generate descriptor set -> perform import rewrites -> modify files accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard subprocess calls to external protobuf tools (protoc, buf) with proper error checking, handles files safely, and performs import rewriting for protobuf generated code. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess invocations are typical for build pipelines and do not indicate malicious intent. The code's purpose aligns with legitimate protobuf tooling, and no suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility for protobuf descriptor generation and import rewriting. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
