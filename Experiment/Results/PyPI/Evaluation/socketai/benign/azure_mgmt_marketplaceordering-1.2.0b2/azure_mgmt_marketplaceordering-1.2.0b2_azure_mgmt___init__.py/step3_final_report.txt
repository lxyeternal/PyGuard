  "purpose": "Support namespace package extension by dynamically importing 'pkgutil' and extending __path__.",
  "sources": "The code reads __path__ and __name__, and uses __import__('pkgutil') to access extend_path.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only modifies __path__ for namespace support.",
  "flows": "Source: __path__, __name__; Sink: extend_path modifies __path__ to include additional package paths.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__('pkgutil') instead of direct import is unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. It dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and extends __path__, a common practice. No malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The use of __import__ is atypical but legitimate. Scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly zero. The security risk score should be lowered from high values (~0.9-1) to a minimal level (~0.1-0.2) to reflect the benign, standard nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for namespace package support. It shows no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current high risk scores are unwarranted; they should be adjusted downward to reflect the safe, common pattern.",
