  "purpose": "Extending the package search path for a Python package to include additional locations.",
  "sources": "__import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "None present; no direct data leaks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input or sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with a string to dynamically import 'pkgutil' is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module and calls 'extend_path' to modify the '__path__' variable, which is a common practice in namespace packages to extend their search paths. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The dynamic import is standard in certain packaging scenarios. No other suspicious code or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package namespace extension technique and shows no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
