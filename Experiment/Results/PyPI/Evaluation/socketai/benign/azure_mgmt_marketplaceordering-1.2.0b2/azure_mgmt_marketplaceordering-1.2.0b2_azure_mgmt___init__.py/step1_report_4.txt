  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "Importing 'pkgutil' and extending '__path__' for package resolution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses its 'extend_path' function to modify the '__path__' variable, which determines the search path for the package's modules. This is a common technique used in namespace packages to aggregate multiple directories. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code is minimal, straightforward, and aligns with standard Python practices for namespace packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard namespace package extension without any malicious intent or security concerns. It is a legitimate pattern used in Python packaging.",
