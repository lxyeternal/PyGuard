{
  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package namespace support",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' to extend the package path using __path__ and __name__",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks related to untrusted data or sensitive operations",
  "flows": "The code reads __path__ and __name__, then uses pkgutil.extend_path to modify __path__",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, typical for namespace packages; no suspicious behavior or secrets observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses extend_path to modify __path__, which is standard for supporting namespace packages. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is simple, transparent, and aligned with common package practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard operation for namespace package extension without any malicious intent or security risks.",
