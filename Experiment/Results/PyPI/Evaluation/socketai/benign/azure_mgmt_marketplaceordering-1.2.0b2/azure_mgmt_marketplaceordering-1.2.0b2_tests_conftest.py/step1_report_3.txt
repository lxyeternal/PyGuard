{
  "purpose": "The code sets up environment variable sanitization for testing purposes, specifically to prevent sensitive information from being recorded or leaked during test runs.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "sinks": "Sanitization functions that replace sensitive data in recordings and headers/body during tests",
  "flows": "Environment variables are fetched; then sanitizers replace these values in logs and network traffic captures during test execution",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; use of hardcoded placeholder values in environment variables is common in testing environments",
  "analysis": "The script loads environment variables, likely containing sensitive Azure credentials. It then applies sanitization functions to mask these values in test recordings to prevent leakage. The sanitizers also mask specific HTTP headers and JSON keys related to access tokens. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code focuses solely on test sanitization and does not perform any network operations or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test sanitization setup intended to hide sensitive credentials during test recordings. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
