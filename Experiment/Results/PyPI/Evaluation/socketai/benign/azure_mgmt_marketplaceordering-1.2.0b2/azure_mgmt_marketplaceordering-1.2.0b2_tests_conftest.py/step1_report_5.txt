{
  "purpose": "The code is used to set up sanitization for API testing recordings by masking sensitive information such as environment variables, headers, and JSON body fields.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET), HTTP headers (Set-Cookie, Cookie), JSON body fields ($..access_token).",
  "sinks": "Sanitization functions that replace sensitive data with placeholders in test recordings.",
  "flows": "Sensitive environment variables are fetched and passed to sanitization functions, which then mask these values in recorded data; headers and JSON fields are sanitized similarly.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded dummy UUIDs for environment variables; no signs of malicious code or backdoors; code appears to be standard sanitization setup for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables related to Azure credentials, then registers sanitizers to mask these variables, headers, and JSON fields in testing recordings. No untrusted data processing, network connections, or suspicious behavior detected. The only notable aspect is the use of default placeholder values, which is common in testing environments. No malicious or obfuscated code is present; the structure and functions are typical for test sanitization. All operations seem aimed at protecting sensitive data during test recording replay.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test sanitization setup intended to mask sensitive information in recordings. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign, controlled test utility with no indicators of malicious intent.",
