  "purpose": "Setup for sanitizing sensitive environment variables, headers, and JSON fields during testing to prevent leakage of secrets in recordings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET), HTTP headers ('Set-Cookie', 'Cookie'), JSON key '$..access_token'.",
  "sinks": "Sanitizers modify data in logs/recordings; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read, then regex sanitizers are applied to mask their values; headers and JSON keys are sanitized before being recorded.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses placeholder values, and performs standard sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables with default placeholders, then applies sanitizers to mask these secrets, headers, and JSON fields during test recordings. It uses functions like add_general_regex_sanitizer, add_header_regex_sanitizer, and add_body_key_sanitizer. There is no network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The purpose is clearly to prevent secret leakage in testing environments. The code is benign, with no signs of malware or backdoors. The use of placeholder values is typical for test setups. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard sanitization setup for testing environments with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the scores assigned are justified. No improvements or adjustments are necessary.",
