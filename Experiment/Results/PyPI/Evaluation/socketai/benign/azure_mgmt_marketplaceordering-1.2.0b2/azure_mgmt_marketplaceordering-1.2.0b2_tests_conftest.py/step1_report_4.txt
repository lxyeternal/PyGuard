{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up sanitization for sensitive environment variables and HTTP headers to prevent leakage of secrets during test recordings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET)",
  "sinks": "Sanitizers applied to headers (Set-Cookie, Cookie) and JSON body fields (access_token)",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at the start and their values are sanitized in recordings; headers and JSON body fields are sanitized during test proxy interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of default placeholder values for sensitive environment variables; no suspicious code logic or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables related to Azure credentials, which have default dummy values. It then applies sanitizers to mask these values and certain HTTP headers and JSON fields during test recordings. This is a standard security practice to prevent secret leakage in logs or recordings. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The use of placeholders indicates awareness of sensitive data handling, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard sanitization procedures for sensitive data during testing. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The use of dummy placeholders is appropriate for test environments, and no suspicious activity is detected.",
