  "purpose": "Setup sanitization for sensitive information in test recordings to prevent leakage of credentials and session data.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "sinks": "Sanitizers applied to regex patterns and header/body key values to mask sensitive data",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and then sanitized in test recordings to prevent data leaks",
  "anomalies": "Use of default placeholder values for sensitive environment variables; no suspicious code behavior or backdoors present",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, loads environment variables, and applies sanitizers to mask sensitive data during testing. No malicious or suspicious code is detected; the environment variables are defaulted to placeholders, indicating caution in handling secrets but not malicious intent. Sanitization functions are used appropriately for data masking, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The code is straightforward and aligns with security best practices for test environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup for sanitizing sensitive information during testing. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks beyond typical placeholders for secrets, which are intended for safe testing environments.",
