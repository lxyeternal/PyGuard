{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up test fixtures and sanitizers for recording and anonymizing sensitive information during testing, specifically related to Azure credentials and HTTP headers.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for Azure credentials (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET), and accesses HTTP headers and JSON response bodies during testing.",
  "sinks": "Sanitizers apply to sensitive data such as subscription IDs, tenant IDs, client IDs, client secrets, cookies, and access tokens, ensuring they are redacted from recordings.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and HTTP response data are sanitized before being stored or logged. Data flows from environment variables or HTTP responses into sanitizer functions to prevent sensitive data leakage.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed. The code primarily performs standard sanitization procedures for testing purposes, with no hidden or malicious activities.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables containing potentially sensitive credentials and applies regex-based sanitizers to redact these credentials from logs or recordings. It also sanitizes cookie headers and access tokens from HTTP responses. All operations are related to test data sanitization, not data exfiltration, malicious code execution, or backdoors. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected; the code's purpose is security hygiene during testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate test fixture setup for sanitizing sensitive data during testing. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, and its security risk is negligible. It follows best practices for protecting sensitive information in test environments.",
