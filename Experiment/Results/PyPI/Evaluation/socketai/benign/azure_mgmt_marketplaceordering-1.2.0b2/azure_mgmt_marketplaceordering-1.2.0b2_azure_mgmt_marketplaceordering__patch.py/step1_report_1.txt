{
  "purpose": "The code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code from Microsoft Azure SDKs, allowing users to add customizations via the `patch_sdk` function.",
  "sources": "No data sources or input reading points are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data outputs, especially no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines an empty function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code contains only comments, import statements, and an empty function.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, intentionally simple template for SDK customization. It does not process data, perform external operations, or contain logic that could be exploited. The presence of licensing and copyright comments, along with the placeholder function, are standard in generated or template code. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template for SDK customization with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard boilerplate code used for extending SDK functionalities.",
