  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious or suspicious code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a minimal, boilerplate template for SDK customization.\n   - No data sources, sinks, or flows involving untrusted data are present.\n   - The only function, `patch_sdk()`, is a placeholder with no operational code.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code consists solely of comments, import statements, and variable definitions.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The conclusion that the code is safe and intended as a template is justified.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to malware, obfuscated code, and security risk:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - Given the absence of any suspicious activity, these scores are appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - No reason exists to assign higher scores since the code is purely boilerplate with no active logic or external interactions.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Potential assumptions or claims:**\n   - The reports do not rely on unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a non-malicious template.\n   - No overgeneralizations or unwarranted security concerns are present.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**\n   - The assigned scores are consistent with the benign, non-operational nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a harmless, standard SDK template with no security issues.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                               |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score    | 0                 | No malicious activity or code detected                     |\n| Obfuscated Score | 0                 | Code is straightforward, with no obfuscation involved       |\n| Risk Score       | 0                 | No security risks or vulnerabilities present               |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, boilerplate SDK customization template with no malicious or security concerns.",
