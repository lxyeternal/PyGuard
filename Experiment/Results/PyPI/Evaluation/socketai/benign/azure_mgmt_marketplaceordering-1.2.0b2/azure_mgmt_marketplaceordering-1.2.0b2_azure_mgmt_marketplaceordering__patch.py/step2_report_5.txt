  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**  \n   All reports uniformly conclude that the code is a benign, boilerplate template for SDK customization. The code contains only comments, import statements, an empty list, and a placeholder function `patch_sdk()` with no logic or data processing.  \n   There are no signs of data flows, external communications, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No malicious payloads or behaviors are detected.\n\n2. **Code Content and Logic:**  \n   The code is minimal and intentionally simple, serving as a scaffold for user customization. The `patch_sdk()` function is meant to be extended but currently does nothing.  \n   The absence of any input/output, network activity, or data manipulation indicates no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** Given the complete lack of suspicious activity, malicious code, or obfuscation, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward and readable, with no signs of obfuscation. Score of 0 is justified.  \n   - **Risk Score:** Since the code is a benign template with no active logic, data handling, or external interactions, a low risk score (close to 0) is justified. The reports uniformly assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a simple placeholder.  \n   No evidence suggests any hidden malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, harmless SDK customization template with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
