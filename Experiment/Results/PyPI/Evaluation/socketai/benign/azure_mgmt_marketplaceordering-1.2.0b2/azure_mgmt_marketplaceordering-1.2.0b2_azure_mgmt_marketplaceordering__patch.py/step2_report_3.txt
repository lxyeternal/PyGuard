  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a minimal template with no data processing, external communication, or logic. All reports agree that there are no sources, sinks, or data flows, and no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n   - The code contains only comments, an import, a variable declaration, and an empty function intended for user customization.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - **Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty.\n   - **Suggestion:** No score adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code is purely boilerplate with no active logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n   - No potential vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified.\n   - **Conclusion:** Risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - No malicious activity is present; the code is a standard SDK template.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a benign template.\n   - **Conclusion:** No challenges needed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Conclusion:** No inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, this code is a standard, harmless SDK template with no security concerns.**",
