{
  "purpose": "This code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code, specifically for Azure SDKs, allowing developers to add custom modifications to the SDK's behavior.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard licensing and placeholder functions without any suspicious or malicious logic. The `patch_sdk()` function is a placeholder intended for user customization, and there are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal template with licensing comments, an import statement, an empty __all__ list, and a placeholder function `patch_sdk()`. There are no data inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The purpose is to serve as a customization point for SDK modifications. The absence of any suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code indicates a benign intent. The code structure and comments suggest it is part of a larger SDK framework for Azure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign SDK customization template with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is simply a placeholder for user modifications, with no apparent malicious behavior or security issues.",
