  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal, boilerplate template for SDK customization.\n- It contains licensing comments, an import statement, an empty `__all__` list, and a placeholder function `patch_sdk()` with no operational logic.\n- There are no data sources, sinks, or data flows.\n- No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose is clearly to serve as a safe extension point for SDK modifications.\n\n**Assessment of the reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior.\n- They correctly identify that the code is a standard placeholder/template.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security concerns are noted.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This is appropriate; no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0 in all reports. Given the benign nature, this is reasonable.\n\n**Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n- No issues found. The code is purely boilerplate with no logic that could be exploited.\n- The reports' reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is a benign, standard SDK customization template.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- Confirmed issues: None.\n- Errors/flaws: None.\n- Scores: Correctly assigned as all zero.\n- Justification: The code is harmless boilerplate with no malicious or security issues.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
