  "purpose": "This code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code, including a placeholder function for patching the SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings and imports, with no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code consists of static definitions and a placeholder function.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only boilerplate comments, import statements, and a placeholder function with no operational code. No suspicious or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a template or scaffold for SDK customization. It imports only standard typing utilities, defines an empty public API list, and includes a function 'patch_sdk' intended for future customization. There are no data processing, input handling, or execution flows that could indicate malicious behavior. The comments reference external documentation for SDK customization but do not contain any code that could be malicious. Overall, it is a benign template with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless template for SDK customization with no malicious intent or security concerns. It only includes boilerplate structure and placeholder functions, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
