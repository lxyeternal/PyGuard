  "purpose": "This code appears to serve as a template or stub for customizing an SDK, providing a placeholder function for user modifications.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are explicitly read or handled in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are present; no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only boilerplate comments, an empty list for __all__, and a placeholder function, with no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a copyright notice, license comment, a docstring, an import statement, a variable assignment for __all__, and an empty function. There are no data inputs, outputs, or complex logic. No hardcoded credentials, malicious instructions, or obfuscated code are present. The function 'patch_sdk' is meant for user customization and does not perform any actions here. Overall, the code is benign and typical of SDK customization templates.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, boilerplate template code intended for user customization of an SDK. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity is detected.",
