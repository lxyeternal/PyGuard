  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a minimal template with no data processing, external communication, or suspicious constructs. The code only contains comments, an import, a variable assignment, and an empty function.  \n   **Conclusion:** No malicious code is present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   The reports uniformly describe the code as boilerplate or placeholder, with no logical flaws or errors. The purpose is explicitly for customization, which is standard practice.  \n   **Conclusion:** No errors or flaws are identified.\n\n3. **Score Justifications:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign and static nature.  \n   - **Overall Risk Score:** Since there's no active logic, data handling, or external interactions, a low risk score (near 0) is justified.\n\n4. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a harmless template.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, harmless SDK customization template with no malicious intent, data handling, or obfuscation. It contains only boilerplate comments, import statements, and an empty placeholder function, which is typical and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk levels.",
