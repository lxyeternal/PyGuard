{
  "purpose": "This code provides a placeholder for customizing generated SDK code, mainly for allowing user modifications and patching the SDK behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "targets": "The code does not interact with untrusted data or external systems; there are no sinks present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows since no input or output operations are implemented.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only standard boilerplate and comments; no suspicious or unusual code behavior is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and consists of licensing comments, import statements, an empty __all__ list, and a single function definition with a docstring. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modification. No secrets, hardcoded credentials, or potentially malicious code are present. The code appears to be a safe placeholder for future customizations of an SDK.\n\nGiven the absence of active logic or external interactions, there is no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a safe, standard boilerplate for SDK customization with no malicious or security-related concerns.",
