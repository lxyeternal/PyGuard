  "purpose": "This script is used to configure the packaging and distribution of the 'azure-mgmt-marketplaceordering' Python library, including version extraction, metadata setup, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from a file (version.py or _version.py), reading README.md and CHANGELOG.md files for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks or code execution. No untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Version info is read from files, then used directly in setup parameters. No untrusted flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected. The code adheres to typical setup script structure.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup configuration tasks, including reading version info from specific files, and setting package metadata. The version extraction uses regex to parse version string. The dependencies and metadata are statically defined. There are no inputs from external or untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads metadata files and configures the package build process.",
