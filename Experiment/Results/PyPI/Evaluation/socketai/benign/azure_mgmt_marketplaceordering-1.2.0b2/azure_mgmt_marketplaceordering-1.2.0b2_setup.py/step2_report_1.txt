  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a standard Python package setup script.\n- It reads version info from local files, which is typical.\n- It reads documentation files (README.md, CHANGELOG.md) locally.\n- No user input, network activity, or external data sources are involved.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The regex used for version extraction is straightforward.\n- The package metadata and dependencies are statically defined.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup script.\n- Findings: No untrusted input, no suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Findings: Reads local files, no external data or malicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Findings: Reads local files, no external or untrusted data.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Findings: Reads local files, no malicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero, but justified as a benign package setup script)\n- Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) is acceptable, considering the code reads static files only. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Findings: Reads local files, no external or untrusted data.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary and overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.1, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the script.\n\n**However,** considering the purpose of this script—package setup—it is inherently low risk, with no suspicious behavior. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in report 4 is justified but could be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — as a static setup script, the risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores are appropriate, with the minor security risk score in report 4 being acceptable but possibly reducible to 0 for consistency.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's nature.",
