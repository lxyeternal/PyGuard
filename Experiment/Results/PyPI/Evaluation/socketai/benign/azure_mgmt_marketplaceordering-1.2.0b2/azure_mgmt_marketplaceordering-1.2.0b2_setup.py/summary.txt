  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly zero. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is unjustified; it should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the script poses no security threat and is appropriate for use."
