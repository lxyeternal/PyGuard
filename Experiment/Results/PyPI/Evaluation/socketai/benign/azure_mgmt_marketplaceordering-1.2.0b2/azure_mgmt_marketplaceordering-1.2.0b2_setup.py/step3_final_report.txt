  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the azure-mgmt-marketplaceordering library.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from local files (version.py or _version.py), reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data flows; static file reads only.",
  "flows": "File reads for version and documentation files; no external or user input data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward file operations and package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script performing static file reads and package configuration. It uses regex to extract version info, which is a common pattern. No external network calls, user inputs, or dynamic code execution are present. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. All operations are safe and standard for Python packaging. The regex assumes a match will be found; if not, it raises a RuntimeError, which is acceptable. The overall structure and content indicate a benign, well-formed setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly zero. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is unjustified; it should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the script poses no security threat and is appropriate for use.",
