{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package, primarily used to define package metadata, dependencies, and version extraction logic.",
  "sources": "File reads from version.py or _version.py to extract version info, and static reads from README.md and CHANGELOG.md.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows lead to untrusted outputs or external communications; setup configuration is static.",
  "flows": "Version extraction reads from local files; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The version parsing uses regex but appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: importing modules, defining package names, reading version info from local files, and configuring package metadata for distribution. All file reads are from local, controlled files. No external network calls or untrusted inputs are involved. The use of regex for version extraction is typical and not suspicious. The setup parameters are standard for Python packages, and there are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain attacks. It reads local files to configure package metadata securely and straightforwardly.",
