  "purpose": "A test suite for Azure SDK's MarketplaceOrderingAgreements operations, verifying the list method.",
  "sources": "The list() method call on the MarketplaceOrderingAgreements client within the test method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; the code only performs an API call and asserts the response.",
  "flows": "From the client.operations.list() source to the assertion of the response, with no external data or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and auto-generated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated pytest test for Azure SDK, performing a benign API call with no external data handling or malicious behavior. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign, boilerplate nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard SDK test script with no malicious intent or security issues. The current scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
