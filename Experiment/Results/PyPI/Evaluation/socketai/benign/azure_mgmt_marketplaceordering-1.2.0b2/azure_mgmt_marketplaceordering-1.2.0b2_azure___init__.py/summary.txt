  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. All reports correctly identify it as a typical namespace package extension pattern. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero; security risk is very low (~0.1 at most in one report), reflecting minimal concern. Overall, the code is safe and well-understood."
