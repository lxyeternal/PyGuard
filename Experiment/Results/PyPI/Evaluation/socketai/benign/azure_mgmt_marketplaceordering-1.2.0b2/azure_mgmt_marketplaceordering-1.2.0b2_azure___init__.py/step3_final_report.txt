  "purpose": "Extend the __path__ variable for namespace package support using pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "The code reads __path__ and __name__, and dynamically imports 'pkgutil'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted sinks; the code only modifies internal package variables.",
  "flows": "Input (__path__, __name__) flows into extend_path, modifying __path__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ for dynamic import is standard; no anomalies or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a common pattern in Python namespace packages, involving dynamic import and extension of __path__. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The dynamic import is typical in such contexts and does not indicate malicious intent. The code's simplicity and standard usage suggest minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. All reports correctly identify it as a typical namespace package extension pattern. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero; security risk is very low (~0.1 at most in one report), reflecting minimal concern. Overall, the code is safe and well-understood.",
