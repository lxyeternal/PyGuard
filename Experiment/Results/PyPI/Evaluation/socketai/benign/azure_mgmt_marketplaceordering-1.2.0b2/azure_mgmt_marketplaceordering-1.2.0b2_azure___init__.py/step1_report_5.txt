{
  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package namespace purposes.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses '__path__' and '__name__' variables, which are standard in Python modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports a standard library and modifies '__path__' using 'extend_path', which is a normal operation in namespace packages.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and uses standard Python mechanisms. No unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "This code imports the 'pkgutil' module and extends the module's search path for package resolution, which is typical in namespace package setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for namespace packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for extending package paths in Python namespace packages. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
