  "purpose": "Extend the current package's search path for module discovery",
  "sources": "__path__ variable, __import__('pkgutil') module",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to untrusted sinks",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends __path__, updating the package's module search path",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard use of extend_path for package namespace extension",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses extend_path to modify the __path__ variable, allowing for namespace package extension. This is a common pattern in Python for managing namespace packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. No data is read from or written to external sources or sinks. The code's function is straightforward and aligns with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard namespace package extension using pkgutil.extend_path, with no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
