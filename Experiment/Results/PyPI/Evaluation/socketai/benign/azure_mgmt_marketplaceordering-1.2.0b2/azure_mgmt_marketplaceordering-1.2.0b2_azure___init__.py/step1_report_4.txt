  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package distribution",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkgutil' module, usage of __import__ to dynamically load it",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present in this line",
  "flows": "Dynamic import via __import__ followed by extend_path method call, which modifies __path__",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with a string, but this is a common pattern for package extension; no suspicious or obfuscated code features",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module using __import__, then calls extend_path on __path__ and __name__. This pattern is typical in namespace packages to extend package search paths. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior indicators. The code is minimal and standard for package extension, with no external data input or potential untrusted data sinks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard package namespace extension, which is a legitimate and common pattern in Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
