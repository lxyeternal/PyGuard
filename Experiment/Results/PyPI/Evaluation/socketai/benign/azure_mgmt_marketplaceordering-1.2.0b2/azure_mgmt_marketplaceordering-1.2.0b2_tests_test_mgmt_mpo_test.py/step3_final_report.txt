  "purpose": "Retrieve Azure Marketplace agreement details using static parameters as a test.",
  "sources": "Static parameters in the API call: offer_type, publisher_id, offer_id, plan_id.",
  "sinks": "API call to Azure SDK; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Static input parameters -> Azure SDK API call -> response assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple, static API call to Azure SDK to retrieve marketplace agreement data, then asserts expected values. It involves no user input, secrets, or network exfiltration. The code is clear, well-structured, and typical for testing SDK interactions. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The only minor concern is the securityRisk score in one report, which is slightly elevated but unwarranted given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward test script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate a safe, standard SDK usage scenario. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0 across all reports.",
