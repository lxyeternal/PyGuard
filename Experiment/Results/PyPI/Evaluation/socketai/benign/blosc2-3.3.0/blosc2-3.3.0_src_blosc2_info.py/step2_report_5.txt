  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the reports and the code:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Logic**:\n   - The code provides functions (`info_text_report_`, `info_text_report`, `info_html_report`) and a class (`InfoReporter`) for formatting and displaying key-value data as text or HTML.\n   - The functions use standard Python libraries (`io`, `pprint`, `TextWrapper`) for string formatting.\n   - The class relies on an attribute `info_items` from the object passed to it, and its string representations are generated via the functions.\n   - There are no indications of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation beyond string formatting.\n\n2. **Malicious Indicators & Anomalies**:\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n   - Commented-out code references `rich.print`, which is an alternative formatting method; this is benign.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.\n\n3. **Assessment of Reports**:\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, purely for report formatting, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), and the scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are consistently 0.\n   - The detailed reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0 is appropriate. No malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0 is appropriate. The code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk score**: 0 is appropriate. No security risks or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies & Recommendations**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No adjustments needed based on the code provided.\n\n6. **Overall Estimation**:\n   - Based on the code and reports, I agree with the assessments: the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final Summary**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code is a harmless utility for formatting and displaying data, with no security concerns.",
