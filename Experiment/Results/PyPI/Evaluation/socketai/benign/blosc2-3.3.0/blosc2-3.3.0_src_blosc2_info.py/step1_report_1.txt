{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and a class to generate textual and HTML reports from a list of items, mainly for informational or debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Data is obtained from the 'items' parameter passed to functions and from the 'info_items' attribute of the object passed to InfoReporter.",
  "sinks": "The data from 'items' and 'info_items' is formatted and returned as strings; there are no sinks that write untrusted data to external systems or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Input data ('items' or 'info_items') flows into formatting functions and is converted into report strings; no further data flow to external systems or dangerous operations is observed.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Commented-out code related to 'rich.print' indicates awareness of alternative formatting methods but is not active.",
  "analysis": "The code defines report generation functions for textual and HTML formats, utilizing standard libraries (io, pprint, TextWrapper). The InfoReporter class encapsulates object info display by relying on 'info_items' attribute. No code injection, external data manipulation, or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears well-structured and purely for formatting purposes without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a benign utility for generating formatted reports from provided data. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and intended for informational display.",
