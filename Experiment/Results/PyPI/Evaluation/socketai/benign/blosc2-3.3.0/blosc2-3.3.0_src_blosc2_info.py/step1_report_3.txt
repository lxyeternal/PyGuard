{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and a class for generating textual and HTML reports from a list of key-value items, primarily for display purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'items' list parameter in functions and the 'obj.info_items' attribute in the class.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs report strings via string concatenation, printing, and HTML formatting; no untrusted data is executed or stored persistently.",
  "flows": "Input data ('items' or 'obj.info_items') flows into report formatting functions, which generate report strings for display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and mainly for formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions ('info_text_report_', 'info_text_report', 'info_html_report') for creating textual and HTML reports from a list of key-value pairs. The 'InfoReporter' class utilizes these functions to represent an object's info items in different formats. The implementation involves standard Python string handling and formatting techniques without any dynamic code execution, network calls, or hidden behaviors. No suspicious patterns or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for formatting report data for display purposes. It contains no malware or malicious intent, and there are no security risks detected.",
