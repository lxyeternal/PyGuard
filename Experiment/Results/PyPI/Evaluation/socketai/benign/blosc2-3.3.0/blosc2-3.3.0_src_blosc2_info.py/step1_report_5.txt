{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions and a class to generate textual and HTML reports from a list of items, primarily for informational display purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'items' parameter passed to functions and class methods, specifically from the 'info_items' attribute of an object.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs report strings via string concatenation, formatting, and print statements, which are only used for generating display content; no data is sent or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'items' parameter or 'info_items' attribute into report formatting functions, resulting in generated report strings in text or HTML formats.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code primarily deals with string formatting and display generation without external network or file I/O beyond in-memory strings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for creating text and HTML reports from provided items. It includes commented-out code that suggests alternative reporting methods but nothing malicious. The class 'InfoReporter' accesses 'info_items' attribute, assumes it exists, and generates reports. All operations are standard formatting and display routines, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, intended solely for generating informational reports. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is straightforward and does not perform any external communication or data manipulation beyond report formatting.",
