{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and a class to generate textual and HTML reports based on a list of items, primarily for informational display purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'items' parameter passed to the functions and class methods, specifically 'obj.info_items' in the class.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs report strings via string concatenation, formatting, and printing to string buffers; no direct untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'items' or 'obj.info_items' into report generation functions, which format and return string representations. There are no untrusted data sinks that lead to system-level actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward formatting and report generation.",
  "analysis": "The script contains utility functions for converting a list of key-value pairs into text or HTML report formats. It also defines a class 'InfoReporter' that uses these functions to represent an object’s information via its 'info_items' attribute. The code does not perform any external data handling beyond string formatting and display, nor does it include any network, file, or system modifications. There are commented-out lines regarding 'rich' printing, but these do not affect runtime behavior and are not malicious. Overall, the code is benign, designed for formatting reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign report formatting utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely formats and displays information without interacting with external systems or data sources in a suspicious manner.",
