  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each aspect of the provided code and reports.\n\n**1. Code Confirmation & Functionality:**\n\n- The code comprises functions (`info_text_report_`, `info_text_report`, `info_html_report`) and a class (`InfoReporter`) that generate textual and HTML reports from a list of key-value items.\n- The functions use standard Python libraries (`io`, `pprint`, `TextWrapper`) for formatting.\n- The class `InfoReporter` relies on an attribute `info_items` of the object it wraps, and its `__repr__` and `_repr_html_` methods invoke the report functions.\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or file I/O beyond in-memory string handling.\n\n**2. Presence of Malicious Code or Anomalies:**\n\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n- Commented-out code references `rich.print`, which is an alternative formatting library, but it's inactive and harmless.\n- No suspicious patterns, such as code injection, external data manipulation, or system modifications, are evident.\n\n**3. Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n\n- The logic for report generation is standard and correct.\n- The assumption that `obj` has an attribute `info_items` is reasonable in context; no flaws are apparent.\n- The functions and class serve purely for formatting and display, with no security implications.\n\n**4. Scores and Their Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0. Given the benign nature, no malicious activity or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0. The code is a utility for report formatting, with no security risks.\n\nThe reports uniformly assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**5. Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n\n- The only assumption is that `obj` has an `info_items` attribute, which is typical for such utility classes.\n- No vulnerabilities are introduced by this assumption; it is standard practice.\n\n**6. Overall Consistency and Additional Considerations:**\n\n- All reports agree on the benign nature.\n- No inconsistencies or signs of malicious intent are detected.\n- The code's purpose is clearly for reporting and display, with no malicious side effects.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Recommendations:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- The code is a benign utility for formatting reports.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- No security risks are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is safe, straightforward, and serves a clear purpose without any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Aspect             | Score | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No malicious activity detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Code is clear and straightforward.                            |\n| Security Risk      | 0       | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified.            |\n\nPlease let me know if further detailed analysis or specific focus areas are needed.",
