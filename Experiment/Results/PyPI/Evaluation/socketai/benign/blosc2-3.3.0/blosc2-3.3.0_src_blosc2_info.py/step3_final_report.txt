{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and a class to generate textual and HTML reports from a list of key-value pairs or an object's info_items attribute, primarily for display purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'items' list parameter and the 'info_items' attribute of the object passed to InfoReporter.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or effects; the code only formats and returns strings or HTML.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'items' or 'info_items' through formatting functions to string or HTML output; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; commented-out code is benign and inactive, and the code uses standard libraries with straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple report formatter that uses standard Python libraries for formatting text and HTML. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation beyond string formatting. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident. The 'InfoReporter' class relies on an 'info_items' attribute, which is a typical pattern. The commented-out code referencing 'rich.print' is harmless. The overall structure and behavior are benign, serving solely for display purposes. The reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, with high confidence. No vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for generating textual and HTML reports from provided data. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
