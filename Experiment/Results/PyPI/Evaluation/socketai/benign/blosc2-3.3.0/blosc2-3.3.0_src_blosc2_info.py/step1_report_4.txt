{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and a class for generating textual and HTML reports from a list of items, primarily for displaying information about objects in a formatted way.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'items' parameter passed to functions and class methods; specifically, it accesses 'obj.info_items' in the class.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted strings to string buffers and HTML strings for display purposes; no external system calls or data leaks are apparent.",
  "flows": "The 'items' data is passed into report functions and then formatted into strings, which are returned for display. The class accesses 'obj.info_items' and uses it as input.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Commented-out code indicates previous alternative formatting but is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward functions to format lists of key-value pairs into text and HTML reports. The 'InfoReporter' class encapsulates the object and generates reports based on its 'info_items' attribute. All operations are benign, involving string manipulation and formatting. No external network, file, or system modifications are performed. The commented-out section is non-executable and related to formatting, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for formatting and displaying object information. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It does not interact with external systems or handle sensitive data maliciously.",
