  "purpose": "Configure documentation build settings for the Python-Blosc2 project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys, blosc2; modifies sys.path; reads configuration variables and extension lists; processes app signals.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data output or external network interactions.",
  "flows": "Imports and path modification do not involve untrusted data flow. Configuration variables are set explicitly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code primarily sets up documentation configuration and modifies sys.path. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a third-party library 'blosc2'. It appends the library path to sys.path to ensure proper module loading. Sets various configuration variables for Sphinx documentation, including theme, static paths, extensions, and HTML options. Defines functions for processing doc signatures and connects them to Sphinx app signals. No user input, network operations, or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign configuration setup for documentation, with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
