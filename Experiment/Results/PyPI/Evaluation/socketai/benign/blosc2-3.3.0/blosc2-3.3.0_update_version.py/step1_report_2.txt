{
  "purpose": "The script updates version numbers in specific project files (pyproject.toml and src/blosc2/version.py).",
  "sources": "The script reads command-line argument for new_version, and reads files pyproject.toml and src/blosc2/version.py.",
  "sinks": "The script writes to pyproject.toml and src/blosc2/version.py after regex replacements.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument (new_version) flows into update_version function, which updates file contents based on this input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. Uses regex replacements; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a version string from user input (sys.argv), then updates specific files with the new version via regex substitution. It performs standard file read/write operations with no obfuscated code or external network activity. No indications of malicious behavior such as data leaks, code injection, or unauthorized actions are present. The script appears to serve a legitimate purpose of version management within a project.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward version updater for project files with no malicious intent. It uses standard file operations and regex replacements. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
