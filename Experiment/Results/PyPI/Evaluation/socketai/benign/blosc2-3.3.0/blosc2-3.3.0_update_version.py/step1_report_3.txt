{
  "purpose": "The script updates version numbers in specific project files (pyproject.toml and src/blosc2/version.py).",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1] (user-provided argument), file reads of 'pyproject.toml' and 'src/blosc2/version.py'",
  "sinks": "File writes to 'pyproject.toml' and 'src/blosc2/version.py', print statement for confirmation",
  "flows": "User input (sys.argv[1]) -> update_version() -> file content modification -> file overwrite",
  "anomalies": "The script directly writes user-provided input into files without validation, which could lead to file corruption if the input is maliciously crafted. However, it does not execute or evaluate the input; the flow is purely file manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code reads the new version string from command-line arguments and updates version entries in specific project files by regex substitution. The process involves reading files, replacing version strings, and writing back. There are no network connections, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated components. The only potential concern is that unvalidated user input could corrupt the files if maliciously crafted, but it does not execute any code or perform malicious actions. Overall, the code is straightforward file manipulation with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script safely updates version information in project files based on user input. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The main risk is that improper input could corrupt files, but it does not pose a security threat beyond that.",
