  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the script's purpose is to update version strings in specific project files.\n- They consistently note that the script reads user input via `sys.argv[1]`, performs regex replacements, and writes back to files.\n- No reports identify malicious code, obfuscation, network activity, or backdoors.\n- The main concern raised is that user input is directly inserted into files without validation, which could lead to file corruption if maliciously crafted input is provided. However, this is a standard practice in such scripts and does not constitute malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The script does **not** contain malware, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior.\n- It performs straightforward file read/write operations with regex replacements.\n- No evidence of hidden malicious intent, code injection, or backdoors.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The only potential flaw is the lack of input validation, which could allow malformed or malicious input to corrupt files. However, this is common in simple utility scripts and not inherently malicious.\n- No logical errors or security vulnerabilities are evident beyond this.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which seems reasonable given the lack of validation. Since the script only performs file modifications based on user input, the risk is minimal.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The risk scores are low because the script does not perform any dangerous operations like executing untrusted code, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- The only concern is the potential for file corruption if malicious input is provided, but this does not constitute a security threat in terms of malware or exploitation.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessments and scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, due to lack of input validation but no real security threat)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal risk, typical for such scripts)\n\nThis script is a benign utility for version management, with no security issues beyond the general caution about unvalidated user input.",
