  "purpose": "The script updates version strings in specific project files (pyproject.toml and src/blosc2/version.py).",
  "sources": "User provides input via command-line argument (sys.argv[1]) for the new version number.",
  "sinks": "The script writes to files 'pyproject.toml' and 'src/blosc2/version.py', replacing version strings.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line argument flows into the update_version function, which modifies specific files by regex replacements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. The script simply performs text replacements based on user input.",
  "analysis": "The code reads user input from sys.argv to determine the new version string, then opens two files and replaces existing version strings with the provided input using regex. The purpose is to automate version updates. There are no suspicious file accesses beyond standard project file modifications. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors are present. The only potential concern is that the script allows arbitrary input for version strings, but this is typical for such update scripts and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a benign function of updating version info in project files with user input. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior and poses no evident security threat.",
