  "purpose": "Update version strings in pyproject.toml and src/blosc2/version.py based on user input.",
  "sources": "User input via sys.argv[1], reading and writing to specific files, regex replacements in file contents.",
  "sinks": "File write operations that overwrite version lines; no untrusted data execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "User input -> regex substitution in file contents -> overwriting version lines in files.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior; minimal risk from unvalidated input.",
  "analysis": "The script performs simple file I/O and regex replacements to update version strings. It accepts user input without validation, which could lead to malformed files if malicious input is provided, but does not execute or evaluate the input. No network activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and benign. The main concern is potential file corruption, not security breach. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for version updating with no malicious intent or behavior. The only minimal risk involves unvalidated user input potentially corrupting files, which is typical for such scripts but not a security threat. Scores should reflect no malware or obfuscation, with a very low security risk score (~0.1).",
