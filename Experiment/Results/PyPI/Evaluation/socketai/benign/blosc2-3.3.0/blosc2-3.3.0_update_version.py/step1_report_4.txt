{
  "purpose": "This script updates version strings in specified project files (pyproject.toml and src/blosc2/version.py) based on the provided argument.",
  "sources": "The script reads from 'pyproject.toml' and 'src/blosc2/version.py'. It also reads the version input from command-line argument sys.argv[1].",
  "sinks": "The script writes updated content back to 'pyproject.toml' and 'src/blosc2/version.py'. It outputs a confirmation message to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv[1] (new_version) flows into regex substitutions, which modify the content of configuration files. The modified content is then written back to files.",
  "anomalies": "The script directly takes a version string from command-line input without validation, and performs string substitution without sanitization, but there are no signs of malicious payload or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing file read/write operations and string replacements to update version numbers. It uses regex substitution to insert the new version. No external network access, code execution, or obfuscated logic is present. The script does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It functions as a utility for version management. The code is well-structured, simple, and appears to serve a legitimate purpose. No anomalies indicative of malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility script for updating version information in project files. It does not contain malware or security risks. The overall security risk score is very low, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
