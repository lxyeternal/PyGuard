  "purpose": "Update version information in specified files for release management.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1] - command line argument providing the new version string.",
  "sinks": "File write operations to 'pyproject.toml' and 'src/blosc2/version.py' files.",
  "flows": "Input from command line argument flows into update_version function, which writes to files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward file read/write and regex replacement.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a version string from command line input and updates version entries in two files using regex substitution. It performs simple string replacement without executing or evaluating input beyond string substitution. No network activity, no code execution based on untrusted data, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard version update utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It simply modifies files based on provided input in a controlled manner.",
