  "flows": "Input from 'pyproject.toml' -> extract version -> write to 'version.py'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward file I/O and data handling; no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library 'tomllib' to load 'pyproject.toml' and extracts the 'version' field. It then writes this version into a Python file as a string assignment. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The operations are simple, predictable, and typical for version management scripts. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's purpose is clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for propagating version info. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, standard operation with no malicious intent.",
