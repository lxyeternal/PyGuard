  "purpose": "Read the version information from pyproject.toml and write it into a Python version file",
  "sources": "Reading the file 'pyproject.toml' in binary mode",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'src/blosc2/version.py'",
  "flows": "Open and read 'pyproject.toml' -> parse content -> extract version -> write version to 'src/blosc2/version.py'",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution observed",
  "analysis": "The script loads the 'pyproject.toml' configuration file using the tomllib library, extracts the 'version' field from the 'project' section, and writes this version string into a new Python file in 'src/blosc2/version.py'. The process is straightforward, with no apparent obfuscated code, external network calls, or hidden behavior. It performs a typical build or version update task, commonly seen in packaging workflows. There are no indications of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version extraction and file writing routine with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply reads configuration data and updates a version file accordingly.",
