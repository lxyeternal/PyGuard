  "flows": "Read 'pyproject.toml' -> extract 'version' -> write '__version__' to version.py.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; straightforward file operations.",
  "analysis": "The script opens and reads 'pyproject.toml' as a TOML file, extracts the 'version' from the 'project' section, and writes this version into a Python file as '__version__'. All operations are standard file I/O and data extraction. There are no network calls, no dynamic code execution, nor suspicious logic. The process appears to be a normal build or version update script. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, legitimate task of extracting version information and writing it to a Python file. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
