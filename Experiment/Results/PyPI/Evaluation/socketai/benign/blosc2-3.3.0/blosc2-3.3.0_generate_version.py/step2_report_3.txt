  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward: reading a TOML configuration file (`pyproject.toml`) and writing the version info into a Python source file (`src/blosc2/version.py`).\n   - No report mentions any code anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n   - The code uses standard libraries (`tomllib`) and simple file I/O operations.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code performs a benign task.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The analysis is thorough and matches the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0 or very close to 0 (0.1 in one case)\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is just reading a configuration file and writing a version string, the security risk is minimal.\n   - The only potential concern could be if the version info was manipulated maliciously, but there's no evidence of that.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain low, well below 0.5.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware score as 0.\n   - No malicious activity is evident.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code's purpose.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, no obfuscation, minimal security risk.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My Own Estimate:**\n\nGiven the uniformity and correctness of the reports, I concur with their assessments. The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a simple, safe utility script for version management. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
