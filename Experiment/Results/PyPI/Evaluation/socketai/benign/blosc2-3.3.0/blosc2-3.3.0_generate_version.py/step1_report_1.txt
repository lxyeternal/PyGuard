  "sources": "Reading from 'pyproject.toml' file",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'src/blosc2/version.py' file",
  "flows": "Reading version data from 'pyproject.toml' -> writing version string to 'src/blosc2/version.py'",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code simply reads a file and writes a value to another file without executing or evaluating untrusted input. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code opens 'pyproject.toml' in binary mode and loads its content using 'tomllib'. It retrieves the 'version' key under the 'project' section. Then, it writes this version string into a new Python file as '__version__'. The operations are straightforward and do not involve dynamic execution, network access, or sensitive data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple read-and-write operation to propagate version info from a configuration file to a Python module. There are no indications of malicious activity or security risks.",
