{
  "purpose": "The code reads version information from a pyproject.toml file and writes it into a Python source file for versioning purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'pyproject.toml' file from disk.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to 'src/blosc2/version.py'.",
  "flows": "Reads version from pyproject.toml (source), then writes it into version.py (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports tomllib to parse a toml file. It opens 'pyproject.toml' in binary mode, loads its content, and extracts the 'version' field from the 'project' table. Then, it writes this version into a Python file at 'src/blosc2/version.py' by defining __version__ as the extracted version string. All operations are straightforward file I/O and data handling with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. No external network communication, no credential handling, and no code injection are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs simple file reading and writing operations to update version information, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
