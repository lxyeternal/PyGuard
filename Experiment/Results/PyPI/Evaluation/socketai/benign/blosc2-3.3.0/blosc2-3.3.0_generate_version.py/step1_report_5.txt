  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures detected. No dynamic code execution or external network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a TOML configuration file (pyproject.toml) to extract the project version, then writes this version into a Python file within the source directory. This process appears to be a straightforward build or setup step, with no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code uses standard library modules and performs predictable file I/O operations. There are no suspicious code patterns, no use of untrusted data sources beyond reading the version, and no external communication or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple utility to synchronize version information from configuration to source code. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
