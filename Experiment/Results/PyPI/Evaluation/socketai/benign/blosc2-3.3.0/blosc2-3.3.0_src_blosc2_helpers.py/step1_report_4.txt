{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator to inherit and modify docstrings for functions, primarily copying parameter descriptions from a parent function to a child function with optional replacements.",
  "sources": "The code reads the docstrings of parent_func and child_func, and also accesses the parameter string within these docstrings.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks; the code only manipulates strings and docstrings.",
  "flows": "The code extracts parameter documentation from parent_func's docstring and inserts it into child_func's docstring, with optional regex replacements.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs string processing for docstring inheritance; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. It uses assertions for validation but does not execute external or untrusted input.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator factory _inherit_doc_parameter which, when applied to a function, copies the documentation for a specified parameter from a parent function to a child function. It performs string parsing and regex matching to identify the relevant parameter lines in the docstrings and adjusts indentation to match the child function's formatting. It optionally applies regex replacements to customize the copied documentation. The code includes assertions for validation and ensures that docstrings are properly modified. No external data is processed, and there are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or harmful logic. The functionality is purely related to documentation management, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard decorator utility for managing docstring inheritance and modifications. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is to facilitate documentation consistency between functions. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious features detected.",
