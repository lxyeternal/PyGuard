{
  "purpose": "This code provides a decorator function to inherit and modify parameter documentation from a parent function's docstring into a child function's docstring.",
  "sources": "Reads the docstrings of the parent_func and child_func, especially lines containing the parameter name.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not execute untrusted input, write to files, or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Extracts parameter documentation from parent_func, adjusts indentation, and injects it into child_func's docstring.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns. The use of regex and string manipulation is standard for docstring modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator factory '_inherit_doc_parameter' that copies parameter documentation from a parent function to a child function. It performs string parsing and replacement operations on docstrings, including regex-based substitutions and indentation adjustments. The process involves assertions to ensure correct extraction and replacement. The code does not execute untrusted data, does not interact with external systems, or perform any suspicious actions. Its purpose appears purely related to documentation management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and focused on documentation inheritance for functions. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present. It is a standard utility for code documentation management.",
