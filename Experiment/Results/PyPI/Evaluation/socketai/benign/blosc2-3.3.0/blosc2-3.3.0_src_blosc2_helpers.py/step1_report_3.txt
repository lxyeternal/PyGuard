{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator factory that copies documentation comments for parameters from a parent function to a child function, with optional replacements.",
  "sources": "Reads the docstrings of parent_func and child_func, and uses regex for string manipulations.",
  "sinks": "Modifies the __doc__ attribute of child_func based on parent_func's docstring.",
  "flows": "Reads docstring lines from parent_func, processes and extracts parameter documentation, then injects it into child_func.__doc__ after regex replacements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard docstring manipulation with regex. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a docstring inheritance utility that copies parameter documentation from a parent function to a child function, with optional regex replacements. It performs string operations on docstrings, including regex matching, replacement, and assertions to ensure correct copying. The logic is straightforward and focused on documentation management. No network activity, file operations, or other malicious behavior is present. The use of assertions for validation is standard and safe in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing docstring inheritance between functions. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is purely related to documentation handling.",
