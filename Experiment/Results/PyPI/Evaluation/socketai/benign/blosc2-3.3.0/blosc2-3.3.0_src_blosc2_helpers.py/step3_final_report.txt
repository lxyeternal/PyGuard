{
  "purpose": "A decorator factory that copies parameter documentation from a parent function to a child function, adjusting indentation and applying optional regex replacements.",
  "sources": "Reads the parent function's __doc__ string, extracts parameter documentation via regex, and accesses the child function's __doc__ for replacement.",
  "sinks": "Modifies the child function's __doc__ string in-place; no external data or resource access occurs.",
  "flows": "Extracts parameter documentation from parent __doc__, adjusts indentation, applies replacements, and inserts into child __doc__.",
  "anomalies": "Uses assertions for validation; no suspicious code, external resource access, or code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for managing function parameter documentation through string manipulation. It uses regex to parse and replace docstring segments, ensuring proper indentation. No external data, network activity, or code execution is involved. Assertions serve as validation checks but do not introduce security risks. The code is benign and solely for documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, utility function for inheriting and modifying parameter docstrings. It does not perform any malicious actions, external resource access, or obfuscation. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately set to 0, and the code poses no security threat.",
