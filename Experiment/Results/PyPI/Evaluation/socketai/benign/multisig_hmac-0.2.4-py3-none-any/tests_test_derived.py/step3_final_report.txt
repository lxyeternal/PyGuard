{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the MultisigHMAC cryptographic class, validating key derivation, signing, verification, threshold schemes, and data handling.",
  "sources": "Seed generation, key derivation, signing functions, and input data within test cases.",
  "sinks": "Verification functions that compare signatures and data; assertion errors indicating input validation failures.",
  "flows": "Seed and data inputs are used to derive keys, which sign data; signatures are combined and verified against inputs, with validation checks for correctness and error conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward cryptographic tests with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic testing procedures, covering various edge cases and input validation. It does not perform any network activity, file I/O, or execute dynamic code. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The tests rely on the underlying implementation, but the test code itself is safe and clear.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, well-structured test suite for the MultisigHMAC cryptographic library. It contains no malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk score are appropriate and should be maintained.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
