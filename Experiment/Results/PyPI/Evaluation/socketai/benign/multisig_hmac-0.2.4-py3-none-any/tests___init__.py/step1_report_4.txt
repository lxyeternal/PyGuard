  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform a specific function, but without the actual code, it cannot be definitively determined. It likely involves standard processing or utility tasks.",
  "sources": "Input sources could include reading environment variables, files, or user input, but none are explicitly identified without the actual code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data leaks, but specific sinks cannot be confirmed without code details.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks cannot be mapped without seeing the code. Typically, flows involve untrusted input reaching sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without examining the actual code content. Absence of code prevents detection of hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "Due to lack of provided code, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Standard risks include hardcoded credentials, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration, but none can be confirmed here.",
  "conclusion": "No code was provided for review. Therefore, no malicious behavior or security issues can be confirmed or denied at this time.",
