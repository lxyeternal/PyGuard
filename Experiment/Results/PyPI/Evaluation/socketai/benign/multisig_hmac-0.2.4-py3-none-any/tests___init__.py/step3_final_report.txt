  "purpose": "The code appears to perform benign utility functions without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources, environment variables, or external data reads identified; no external data flows detected.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, network connections, or file operations that could lead to data exfiltration or malicious effects observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified; code execution paths are straightforward and benign.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected; code structure is clear and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0, with low security risk scores (0.1–0.2). Confidence levels are high where code is reviewed, reflecting consistent benign assessments. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. Security risk is minimal, and the overall assessment aligns across reports. No adjustments are necessary; the code can be considered safe.",
