  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform data processing or utility functions within a larger application, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external modules or APIs. No explicit external input sources like network, user input, or files are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data outputs to logs, network requests, or file writes, but none are explicitly shown or misused in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or parameters through various processing functions, with no evidence of data being sent to untrusted sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The code structure appears straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is examined for common security issues, malicious behaviors, or anomalies. It utilizes standard Python functions and modules without suspicious imports. No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious logic are present. The code does not handle sensitive data insecurely nor interacts with external systems in an unusual way. It appears to serve a benign purpose aligned with typical application logic.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to be legitimate and does not exhibit any suspicious patterns or backdoors. The overall security risk is low.",
