  "purpose": "A cryptographic utility implementing multi-signature HMAC operations, key generation, key derivation, signing, verification, and signature combination for secure multi-party authentication.",
  "sources": "Standard cryptographic libraries (os.urandom for randomness, hashlib and hmac for hashing and signing).",
  "sinks": "HMAC digests, signature byte arrays, internal data structures such as bitfields and combined signatures.",
  "flows": "Key and seed generation via os.urandom; signing data with HMAC; combining signatures through XOR; verifying signatures by recomputing and checking bitfields and digest sums.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity; code is straightforward and uses standard cryptographic primitives.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard cryptographic implementation for multi-signature schemes using HMAC with SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512. It employs secure randomness, proper input validation, and cryptographic primitives correctly. Signature combination via XOR is a known pattern in multi-signature schemes. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code's structure and logic are clear, with no signs of obfuscation or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9) are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented cryptographic utility for multi-signature HMAC operations. It shows no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects the inherent complexity of cryptography but no specific vulnerabilities. The malware score remains at 0, and obfuscation at 0, indicating a benign, transparent implementation.",
