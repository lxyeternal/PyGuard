{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the MultisigHMAC class, verifying key generation, signing, combining signatures, and verification functionality.",
  "sources": "Input data: test data variables (e.g., data_empty, data_short, data_long), keys generated by m.keygen, and signatures produced by m.sign.",
  "sinks": "Verification functions and assertion statements that process signatures and keys; base64 encoding/decoding for simulated network transmission.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., data_short) is signed with keys, signatures are combined, then signatures and data are verified; base64 encoding simulates data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. All functions are standard unit tests.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests for the MultisigHMAC class, testing core cryptographic operations and input validation. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity is evident. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present. The code follows typical testing patterns without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard set of unit tests for a cryptographic module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and intended for validation purposes only.",
