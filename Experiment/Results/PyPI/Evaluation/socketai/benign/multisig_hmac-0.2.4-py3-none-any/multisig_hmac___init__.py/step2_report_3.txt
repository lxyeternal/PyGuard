  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a set of module-level string assignments defining package metadata (__version__, __author__, __license__).\n- The code is straightforward, static, and contains no input/output, external calls, or dynamic behavior.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are identified in any report.\n- The confidence levels are all at 1, indicating certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code in all reports matches the original code snippet provided.\n- There are no discrepancies between the code and the described analysis.\n\n**Error or Flaws in Reports:**\n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in any of the reports. They are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis that this is standard metadata declaration code.\n\n**Potential Risks or Malicious Behavior:**\n- Since the code only assigns static strings, there is no basis for higher malware or security risk scores.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis correctly dismisses any such concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Final note:** All reports correctly identify this as standard, safe package metadata code with no security concerns.",
