  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code snippet provided:\n\nOriginal Code:\n```python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\n__version__ = '0.2.4'\n__author__ = 'Amalie Due Jensen'\n__license__ = \"ISC\"\n```\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \nThis is a standard Python module defining package metadata variables with static string literals. It contains no functions, input handling, external data processing, or dynamic behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5** all state that the code is purely metadata, with no data flows, external interactions, or suspicious behavior. They conclude that the code is benign, standard, and contains no security or malicious concerns.\n\n**Common points across reports:**\n- No untrusted data input/output\n- No data leaks or external interactions\n- No obfuscation or malware\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns\n- Standard practice for package metadata\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n- confidence: 1 (high confidence in benign nature)\n- obfuscated: 0\n- malware: 0\n- securityRisk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n1. **Are the reported issues present?**  \n   Yes. The code is straightforward, and the reports correctly identify it as standard package metadata.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n   No. The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n3. **Scores and reasoning:**  \n   The assigned scores seem appropriate given the analysis. Since the code is purely static metadata, a malware score of 0 is justified. The security risk score of 0 also makes sense.\n\n4. **Potential risks or assumptions:**  \n   No assumptions are made beyond the code snippet. The reports do not claim any hidden malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Consistency with the code:**  \n   The scores align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated; straightforward string assignments)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n\n- The code is standard package metadata, and there is no indication of malicious intent or hidden payloads.\n- The reports are thorough and consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Value | Justification                                                                                 |\n|------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware          | 0            | No malicious activity or behavior present.                                                 |\n| obfuscated       | 0            | Code is straightforward with static string literals.                                       |\n| securityRisk     | 0            | No security vulnerabilities or risky behavior identified.                                |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, and the assessments are accurate.**",
