{
  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __license__) as static string literals for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it only assigns static strings to variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and does not handle data dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static declaration of package metadata variables with no dynamic behavior, external interactions, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no security issues or obfuscation. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package metadata module with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
