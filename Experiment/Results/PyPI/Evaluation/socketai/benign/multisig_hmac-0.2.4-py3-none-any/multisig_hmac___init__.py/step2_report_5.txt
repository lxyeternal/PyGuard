  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports describe the code as simple metadata variable assignments (`__version__`, `__author__`, `__license__`) with no input/output, external interactions, or complex logic.\n   - The original code snippet confirms this: it only assigns string literals to module-level variables.\n   - **Conclusion:** There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent, each emphasizing that the code is straightforward metadata with no suspicious activity.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - **Note:** They uniformly assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is appropriate.\n   - No reason exists to assign higher scores since there's no vulnerability, malicious activity, or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or external interactions.\n   - **Conclusion:** The malware score is justified as 0.\n\n6. **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly dismiss any potential vulnerabilities, given the code's simplicity.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made; the analysis is accurate.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores align well with the described analysis.\n   - No inconsistencies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard package metadata declaration with no security concerns.**  \nNo changes to scores or analysis are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores reflect the absence of malicious or risky behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scores and conclusions.",
