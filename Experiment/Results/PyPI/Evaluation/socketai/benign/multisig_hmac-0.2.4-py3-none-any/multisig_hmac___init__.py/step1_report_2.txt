  "purpose": "Define metadata attributes for a Python package or module, including version, author, and license information.",
  "sources": "None; the code only sets string variables for metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "None; there are no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward metadata definition with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, setting package metadata attributes with string literals. There are no data inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be standard package metadata code, typical for Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for Python package metadata. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
