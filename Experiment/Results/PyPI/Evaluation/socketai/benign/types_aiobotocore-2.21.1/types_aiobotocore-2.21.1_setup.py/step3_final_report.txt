  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'types-aiobotocore' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading static README.md file; no external or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the script does not process untrusted data or perform actions affecting external systems.",
  "flows": "Static data flow from file read to setup configuration; no dynamic or external data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and uses well-known packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. It reads a static README file and calls setuptools.setup() with fixed metadata, dependencies, and package data. No network activity, external input handling, or obfuscated code is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the script. The reasoning in all reports correctly identifies the code as safe, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard package configuration file with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified, indicating no threat to supply chain security.",
