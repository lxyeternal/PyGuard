{
  "purpose": "To configure and package the 'pyspin' Python library for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.rst file for long_description; imports 'pyspin' to access its __version__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input; no network, file, or environment variable outputs involved.",
  "flows": "Reads README file -> accesses 'pyspin' module for version -> passes data to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated sections present. The code performs standard setup tasks without unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration for packaging a Python module. It imports the module to access version info, reads a README file, and calls setup() with package metadata. All operations are standard and do not involve data manipulation or external communications. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No suspicious or malicious actions are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and intentionally designed for distribution purposes only.",
