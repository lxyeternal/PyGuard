{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'pyspin' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'README.rst' for long_description and imports 'pyspin' to access its version.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function uses metadata, dependencies, and package information; no direct data sinks for untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads file -> imports module -> passes data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior; dependencies are standard, and the code is typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file for a Python package, importing 'setuptools' and 'pyspin' for package metadata. It reads the README file for description and specifies dependencies, including conditional dependencies based on Python version. No suspicious imports, network activity, or malicious code present. No obfuscated code or unusual logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
