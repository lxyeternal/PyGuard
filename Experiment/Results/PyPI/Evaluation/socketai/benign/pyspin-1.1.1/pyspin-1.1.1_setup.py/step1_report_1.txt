{
  "purpose": "This script is used for setting up and distributing a Python package called 'pyspin'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long description, importing 'pyspin' module for version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "Reads package metadata from local files and imports a module for version info, then passes data to 'setup()' for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements. All activities are standard for a Python setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a local README file, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata. The 'pyspin' module is used solely to retrieve version info, which is common practice. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or suspicious patterns are observed. The code aligns with typical setup scripts for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
