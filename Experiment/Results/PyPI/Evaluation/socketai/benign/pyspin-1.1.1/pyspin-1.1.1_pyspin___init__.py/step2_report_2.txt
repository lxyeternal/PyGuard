  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Content of the code snippet:**\n   - The code consists solely of module metadata, including `__title__`, `__version__`, `__author__`, `__license__`, and `__copyright__`.\n   - There are no executable functions, logic, input/output handling, or dynamic behavior.\n   - The code is purely documentation and metadata, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Assessment of each report:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is metadata-only, benign, and contains no executable logic or data handling.\n   - They uniformly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1), indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n\n3. **Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n   - Since the code is only metadata, there is no basis for any security concern, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable given the code snippet.\n\n4. **Scores justification:**\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate because there's no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is correct, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score of 0 is justified, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Additional considerations:**\n   - Since the code is only metadata, any risk or malware scoring higher than 0 would be unwarranted.\n   - The reports correctly identify the absence of any security issues.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is harmless, metadata-only, with no executable or malicious content.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the understanding that the code fragment is purely documentation and metadata, posing no security threat.",
