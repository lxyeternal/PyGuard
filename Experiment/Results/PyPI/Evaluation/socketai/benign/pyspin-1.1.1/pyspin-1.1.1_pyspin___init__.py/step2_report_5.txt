  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Nature**:\n   - All reports confirm that the provided code is purely metadata and documentation, containing no executable logic, input/output handling, or dynamic behavior.\n   - The code snippet consists solely of module metadata: title, version, author, license, copyright.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden functionality.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior**:\n   - Since the code is only metadata, the malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n   - No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are detected.\n   - No network activity, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Flaws**:\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign with no security risks.\n   - Given the absence of executable code, this assessment is accurate.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - The securityRisk scores are 0, justified by the absence of any executable or suspicious elements.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting high certainty based on the metadata-only nature of the code.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - Since the code is only metadata, there is no basis for higher risk or malware scores.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- The code fragment is entirely benign, serving as a header or metadata for a Python package.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe reports are accurate, and the code fragment is harmless. No further action or concern is necessary.",
