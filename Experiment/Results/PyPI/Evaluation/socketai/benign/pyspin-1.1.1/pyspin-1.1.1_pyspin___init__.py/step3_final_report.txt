  "purpose": "This code serves as package metadata and documentation, providing information about the package such as title, version, author, license, and copyright. It does not contain executable logic or dynamic behavior.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data, as it consists solely of static metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, since the code is purely static metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; there are no source-to-sink paths because the code does not process or handle data dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward metadata with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static metadata with no executable logic, input/output handling, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify this as benign, metadata-only code. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified given the content. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence scores are justified. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code fragment is harmless, containing only package metadata and documentation. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concerns. The current assessments and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
