  "purpose": "A simple terminal spinner library for Python, used to show progress indicators in command-line applications.",
  "sources": "No external input sources detected in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data output points that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly consists of metadata and description.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable logic, functions, or dynamic code. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only metadata, documentation, and licensing information for a Python package. There are no functions, external data processing, or executable statements. The script is designed as a library module with no apparent malicious intent or risky behaviors. Since it lacks operational code, it does not perform any data manipulation, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward package description with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is a benign metadata script defining package information.",
