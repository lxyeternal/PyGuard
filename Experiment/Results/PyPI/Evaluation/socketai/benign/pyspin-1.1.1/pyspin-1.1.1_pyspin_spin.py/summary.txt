  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured CLI spinner utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the minimal security risk score (around 0.1) reflects the negligible risk of output flooding or misuse, which is not malicious. Overall, the code is safe for use."
