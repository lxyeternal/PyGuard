{
  "purpose": "This code implements various animated spinners for CLI output, with a decorator to run functions asynchronously while displaying a spinner animation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no untrusted input data; it only uses function arguments and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; the code outputs spinner animations to standard output.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; spinner frames are static, and function outputs are returned directly without external data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes multiple spinner styles and a decorator for asynchronous execution, but no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines spinner characters and a decorator to animate CLI output during asynchronous function execution. It uses threading and time delays but does not process external inputs or perform network operations. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. The code appears to be a benign utility for visual feedback during long-running processes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI spinner utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is straightforward and well-structured, with no suspicious behaviors detected.",
