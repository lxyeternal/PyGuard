{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility for creating animated spinners in the terminal, useful for indicating progress during asynchronous function execution.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line output streams (stdout) via print statements; uses threading and concurrent futures to manage asynchronous execution.",
  "sinks": "Outputs spinner animation and progress words to standard output; no untrusted data input or external data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "The spinner animation runs concurrently with the decorated function execution, displaying progress while the function executes asynchronously.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or data exfiltration detected. Usage of threading and futures is standard for progress indicators.",
  "analysis": "The script defines multiple spinner styles and a decorator to wrap functions with a progress indicator. It uses threading to run the wrapped function asynchronously while displaying a spinner animation. No external network activity, file operations, or data manipulation outside standard progress display are present. The code is straightforward, using common Python constructs. It appears to serve a benign purpose, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. No suspicious code flows or anomalies were detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign terminal progress spinner utility with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as an unobtrusive progress indicator, with no external communications or sensitive data handling.",
