  "purpose": "A CLI utility implementing animated spinners with a decorator to run functions asynchronously while displaying a spinner.",
  "sources": "No untrusted input; uses standard libraries (sys, time, concurrent.futures) for output and threading.",
  "sinks": "Outputs only to stdout; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Function arguments and system info are read; spinner frames are cycled during function execution, outputting to console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Unicode spinner styles and a Spinner class to cycle through frames. The make_spin decorator runs a target function in a separate thread, displaying a spinner animation during execution. It uses standard Python modules and proper thread management. No external inputs, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The spinner is purely for visual feedback in CLI applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured CLI spinner utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the minimal security risk score (around 0.1) reflects the negligible risk of output flooding or misuse, which is not malicious. Overall, the code is safe for use.",
