  "purpose": "The code provides a spinner animation utility for indicating progress during the execution of functions, supporting compatibility across Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "Reads no external input; uses internal parameters and function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Outputs spinner animation frames and progress messages to standard output; no untrusted data processing or external data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Spinner frames are iterated and printed to stdout during function execution; no flow involves untrusted or malicious data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. Usage of unicode characters for visual effect is benign. No indications of backdoors or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple unicode-based spinner styles and a Spinner class to manage animation frames. The make_spin decorator wraps functions to display a spinner animation while the wrapped function runs asynchronously using ThreadPoolExecutor. The spinner updates in a non-blocking way, printing frames to stdout with carriage returns for animation. No external data sources, credential handling, or network operations are present. The code appears to serve a visual feedback purpose with safe practices and no malicious code elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for visual progress indication. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. It solely manages console output for a spinner animation without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
