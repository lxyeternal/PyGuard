{
  "purpose": "The code defines spinner animations and a decorator to display a spinner in the console while executing functions asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily the function arguments and system state; no external data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs spinner animations to stdout; no data is written to files or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "The spinner runs concurrently with the decorated function execution, displaying progress on the console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code uses multiple Unicode spinner styles, which is typical for progress indicators.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a utility for visual progress indication using Unicode characters and threading for non-blocking display. It includes a version compatibility check, spinner class, and a decorator for applying the spinner to functions. The threading and function invocation appear standard; no network activity, system modifications, or malicious logic are present. No obfuscation, hidden code, or unusual patterns are detected. The code could be misused to mask long-running operations but by itself, it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility for displaying animated spinners during function execution. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code snippet.",
