  "purpose": "Setup script for registering pandas and modin extension accessors, and suppressing future warnings.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, checks sys.modules for 'modin.pandas', and calls registration functions based on that.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Imports -> warning suppression -> conditional registration -> exports and version setting.",
  "anomalies": "Broad suppression of FutureWarnings; conditional registration based on module presence, but both are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward setup tasks for pandas and modin extensions. It imports necessary modules, suppresses warnings, and conditionally registers modin if present. No malicious code, network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The conditional registration is a common pattern for optional dependencies. Warning suppression, while potentially hiding important notices, is typical in setup scripts and not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard setup code with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are justified and appropriate.",
