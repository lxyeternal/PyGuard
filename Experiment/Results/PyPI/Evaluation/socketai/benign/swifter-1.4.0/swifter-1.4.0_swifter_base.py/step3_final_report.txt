  "purpose": "Utility functions for sampling, suppressing stdout/stderr, error handling, and setting data partitions in a data processing context.",
  "sources": "Shape attribute of the base object, environment variables (ray detection), np.random.choice for sampling, importlib for optional dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No unsafe data sinks; no network activity or data exfiltration; suppression redirects stdout/stderr to devnull.",
  "flows": "Sampling indices from object shape -> potential suppression of logs during processing -> setting number of partitions based on CPU count.",
  "anomalies": "Use of output suppression to hide logs/errors; no obfuscation or hidden code; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module employing standard libraries and patterns. It handles errors gracefully, detects optional dependencies, and manages sampling and partitioning for data workflows. The suppression of stdout/stderr, while potentially misused, is a common pattern for silent operation. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The error handling and environment detection are standard, and the sampling logic is typical. The code's clarity and lack of suspicious patterns indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for data processing workflows with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score reflects minimal concerns, primarily about output suppression potentially hiding errors, but this is not malicious. The malware and obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
