{
  "purpose": "A custom callback class for integrating a tqdm progress bar with Dask computations.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dask.callbacks' and 'tqdm.autonotebook'. No input data sources within the class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output is present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code primarily manages internal state and UI components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs straightforward progress bar updates tied to Dask tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from Dask's Callback to display a tqdm progress bar during Dask computations. It initializes the progress bar with total tasks based on internal states, updates it per task, and closes it at the end. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The imports are from reputable libraries, and the methods perform standard UI updates without executing external commands or handling sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a progress bar callback for Dask with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
