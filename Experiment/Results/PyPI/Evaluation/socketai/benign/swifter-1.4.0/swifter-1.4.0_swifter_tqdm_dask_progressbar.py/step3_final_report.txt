  "purpose": "A tqdm progress bar for dask callbacks to visualize task progress during computations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the dask callback lifecycle methods (_start_state, _posttask, _finish).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (task states) flows into progress bar initialization and updates; no external sinks or data leaks occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward class inheriting from dask.callbacks.Callback, initializing a tqdm progress bar based on task counts, updating it after each task, and closing it at the end. It uses only standard libraries, with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports concur on its benign nature, assigning zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with typical usage patterns for progress visualization. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a Dask callback for progress visualization using tqdm. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores should be zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk categories, consistent with the analysis.",
