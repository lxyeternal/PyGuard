The assigned scores should be zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk categories, consistent with the analysis."

The low risk score reflects minimal concerns, primarily about output suppression potentially hiding errors, but this is not malicious. The malware and obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the code's straightforward nature."

The assigned scores—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.1—are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and content."

The only inherent risk involves executing user-defined functions, which is standard in pandas and not specific to this implementation. The security risk score is appropriately low, and malware and obfuscation scores are zero."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, performance-oriented extension to pandas and dask, with no evidence of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or sabotage. The primary risk stems from executing user-supplied functions, which is standard for such tools. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), consistent with the inherent risks of executing untrusted code but no malicious activity detected."
