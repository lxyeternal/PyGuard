  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, performance-oriented extension to pandas and dask, with no evidence of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or sabotage. The primary risk stems from executing user-supplied functions, which is standard for such tools. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), consistent with the inherent risks of executing untrusted code but no malicious activity detected."
