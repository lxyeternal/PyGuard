  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step.\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code is a standard `setup.py` configuration for a Python package named \"swifter.\"\n   - It specifies dependencies, metadata, and optional extras.\n   - There are no embedded malicious scripts or suspicious code snippets.\n   - The dependencies listed are common data processing libraries, and the code structure appears typical.\n\n2. **Assessment of Reported Issues:**\n   - All reports are empty (\"Empty response\"), indicating no specific concerns or findings are documented.\n   - Without explicit reports, I cannot identify any errors, flaws, or malicious behavior based on the provided information.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - Since no issues are reported, the malware score should be 0.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be 0, as there's no evidence of obfuscation.\n   - The risk score should be minimal (close to 0), given the lack of any reported problems or suspicious activity.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions:**\n   - The only concern could be malicious code hidden elsewhere, but nothing in the `setup.py` indicates that.\n   - The dependencies are standard, and the setup script is straightforward.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the available data, **no issues are present**.\n   - The scores should be:\n     - **Malware score:** 0\n     - **Obfuscated score:** 0\n     - **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Note:** If future reports provide specific concerns, I will reassess accordingly.",
