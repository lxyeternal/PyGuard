  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information carefully.\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code is a standard `setup.py` for a Python package named \"swifter.\"\n   - It specifies dependencies, metadata, and optional extras.\n   - No malicious or suspicious code is present; it appears to be a typical package setup script.\n   - No embedded scripts, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are visible.\n\n2. **Reports Review:**\n   - All five reports contain only an \"Empty response\" error with no further details.\n   - This indicates that there are no actual reports or observations to analyze regarding vulnerabilities, malware, or issues.\n   - Without specific reports, we cannot identify or confirm any issues, flaws, or malicious activity.\n\n3. **Implications:**\n   - Since no reports provide concrete details, there is no evidence of malware, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n   - The absence of reports suggests either no issues were found or the reports are incomplete.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - Given the lack of information, the malware score should be **0**.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be **0**, as there's no indication of obfuscation.\n   - The risk score should be **0** or very close to it, since no issues are reported.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports (if any) are not available for review, but based on the data, they should be minimal.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the provided code and the empty reports, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. All scores should reflect this absence.\n\nPlease provide detailed reports if available for a more thorough review.",
