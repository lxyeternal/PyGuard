{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to resolve datasets, register dataset resolvers, verify dataset types, and create external references to datasets in Azure ML workspace environments.",
  "sources": "Request parameters such as 'ws_name', 'subscription', 'resource_group', 'dataset_name', 'dataset_version'; imports of azureml modules; dataset objects passed into functions.",
  "sinks": "JSON writes to 'writer', potential dataset retrievals and references, dataset type checks, external reference creation.",
  "flows": "Input requests lead to workspace and dataset retrieval, dataset definition fetching, dataset validation, and external reference creation. Data flows from request parameters to Azure ML SDK calls and JSON responses.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except blocks around imports, standard dataset referencing, and dataset validation without apparent malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious data leaks, or backdoors detected. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles dataset resolution, validation, and referencing using Azure ML SDK. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, performs dataset type checks, and constructs dataset references based on dataset properties. All operations involve standard SDK calls with exception handling. No code indicates malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoor behavior. The logic aligns with common dataset management practices in Azure ML environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate dataset management logic with no signs of malicious activity. It handles dataset references and validation securely, with appropriate error handling and no suspicious operations observed.",
