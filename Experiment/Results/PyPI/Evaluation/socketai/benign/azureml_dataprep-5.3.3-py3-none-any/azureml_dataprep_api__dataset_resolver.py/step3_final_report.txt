{
  "purpose": "The code manages dataset resolution, validation, and referencing within AzureML, ensuring compatibility across SDK versions with fallback imports, and performs workspace verification.",
  "sources": "Request parameters ('ws_name', 'subscription', 'resource_group', 'dataset_name', 'dataset_version'), internal SDK methods, dataset properties, environment variables (implied via SDK calls).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via 'verify_workspace' or 'get_workspace_from_run' if they expose sensitive info, or via dataset definitions if improperly handled. No network or file sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> workspace and dataset retrieval -> dataset definition JSON extraction -> external reference creation; exception handling covers errors at each step.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal methods like 'Dataset._get_definition_json()' and fallback imports from 'azureml.contrib' are standard for compatibility, not obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard AzureML dataset management tasks, with fallback imports for SDK version compatibility. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected. Exception handling is broad but typical. No network activity or data exfiltration observed. The fallback imports and internal method usage are legitimate SDK practices, not obfuscation. The overall structure is clear, and the purpose aligns with legitimate dataset handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The risk score is appropriately low, reflecting standard SDK operations without exploitable flaws.",
