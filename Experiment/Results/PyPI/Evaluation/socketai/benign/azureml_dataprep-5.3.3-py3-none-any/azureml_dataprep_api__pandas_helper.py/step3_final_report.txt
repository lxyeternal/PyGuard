  "purpose": "Manage dependency imports (pandas, numpy, pyarrow), check their versions, and sanitize pandas DataFrames for native compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version string parsing, DataFrame columns and dtype checks",
  "sinks": "Exception raising for missing dependencies, DataFrame schema modifications",
  "flows": "Import attempts -> setting flags -> dependency verification -> DataFrame sanitization",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling during imports; version check logic for pyarrow may be flawed (using 'pyarrow_major <= 0 and pyarrow_minor < 16')",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency management and DataFrame schema normalization without malicious activity. No network or data exfiltration occurs. The broad exception handling is standard but could mask errors; the version check for pyarrow is logically inconsistent but not security-critical. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The overall behavior is benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) justified by the broad exception handling and version checks. Minor logical flaw in version comparison does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency and data normalization utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The slightly elevated risk score reflects cautious handling but is justified given the benign nature. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.",
