{
  "purpose": "This code manages the import and compatibility checks for third-party Python libraries pandas, numpy, and pyarrow, and provides functions to ensure dataframes are compatible with native processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pandas, numpy, and pyarrow; Attribute access for version checking; Function parameters receiving pandas DataFrame objects.",
  "sinks": "Potential raises in exception handling functions (_ensure_numpy_pandas, _try_import), and data processing functions (_sanitize_df_for_native, ensure_df_native_compat) that operate on DataFrame objects.",
  "flows": "Import attempts in _try_import() determine library availability; _ensure_numpy_pandas() invokes import checks; _sanitize_df_for_native() processes DataFrame columns; ensure_df_native_compat() calls _sanitize_df_for_native() after verifying library presence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Exception handling is broad but typical for import failures. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present. The code appears solely for library compatibility and data sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import key data processing libraries and sets global flags indicating their availability and capabilities. It handles version differences and feature support. Functions for verifying library presence and processing pandas DataFrames are included. The exception handling is broad but standard for import errors. No signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads are present. The code’s purpose aligns with ensuring compatibility and data integrity rather than performing any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and data processing utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It functions to ensure necessary libraries are available and prepares DataFrames for native processing, with no suspicious activity detected.",
