{
  "purpose": "This code manages the import and compatibility checks for pandas, numpy, and pyarrow libraries, ensuring they are available and meet certain version requirements for data processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports pandas, numpy, and pyarrow; reads version information from pyarrow; accesses DataFrame columns and their attributes.",
  "sinks": "Raises custom import error exceptions if dependencies are missing; processes DataFrame columns and values without untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Import attempts lead to setting global flags; version checks flow from pyarrow import to feature support flags; DataFrame column handling flows from column type checks to value extraction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The use of global variables is typical for import state caching. No obfuscated code, malicious API calls, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard import handling with exception catching, version checking, and feature support flag setting. It includes functions to verify the presence of dependencies and a utility to sanitize pandas DataFrames for native compatibility. The code contains no data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious logic. It primarily focuses on import management and data schema adjustments, which are typical for data processing workflows.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign utility for managing library dependencies and DataFrame preparation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages import states and processes DataFrame schemas safely.",
