{
  "purpose": "This code attempts to import and check the availability of third-party Python libraries (pandas, numpy, pyarrow) and provides utility functions to ensure their presence and compatibility for data processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports of pandas, numpy, and pyarrow modules; reading of pandas DataFrame columns and version attributes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data or send data externally; functions primarily handle internal data validation and library checks.",
  "flows": "The functions import libraries, check their versions and capabilities, and process pandas DataFrames to ensure compatibility. No external or untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. Version checks and attribute inspections are standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to attempt importing pandas, numpy, and pyarrow, setting global flags based on success and version capabilities. It raises custom exceptions if required libraries are missing, but only in response to explicit function calls. The DataFrame sanitization function adjusts column names and handles categorical data types for internal compatibility. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behavior is evident. The code’s structure is straightforward, with clear library handling and data validation routines, indicating no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for ensuring third-party library availability and DataFrame compatibility. There are no signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage. It functions as a benign dependency management and data sanitization module.",
