{
  "purpose": "This code manages the import and compatibility checks for pandas, numpy, and pyarrow libraries, including handling different versions and feature support.",
  "sources": "The code reads import attempts for pandas, numpy, and pyarrow; accesses version attributes of pyarrow; reads DataFrame columns and data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted user input or external data directly; it primarily manipulates pandas DataFrame structures internally.",
  "flows": "Import attempt functions determine library availability; _ensure_numpy_pandas() verifies library presence; _sanitize_df_for_native() processes DataFrame schemas and data for compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code is straightforward in its import handling and DataFrame processing, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to import dependencies (pandas, numpy, pyarrow) and check their versions and support features. It raises custom errors if pandas or numpy are missing when required. The _sanitize_df_for_native() function manipulates DataFrame column schemas, including flattening MultiIndex columns and converting categorical columns, which appears to be standard data processing logic. There are no suspicious code behaviors, data leaks, or network operations. No indications of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module performs dependency management and DataFrame schema normalization without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a typical utility code for compatibility handling in data processing workflows.",
