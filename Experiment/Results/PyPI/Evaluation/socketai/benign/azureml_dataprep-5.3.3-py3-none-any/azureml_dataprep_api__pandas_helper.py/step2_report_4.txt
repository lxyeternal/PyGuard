  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the overall security risk.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code manages import attempts for pandas, numpy, and pyarrow, setting global flags based on success and version checks.\n- It includes functions to verify dependencies and sanitize pandas DataFrames for native compatibility.\n- All operations are standard for dependency management and data schema normalization.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, network activity, or obfuscated code are present.\n- Exception handling is broad but typical for import failure scenarios.\n- The DataFrame processing involves flattening MultiIndex columns and converting categorical columns, which is standard data preparation.\n\n---\n\n### Issue Presence\n- **Are any issues present?**  \n  No, the code performs typical dependency checks and data sanitization without any suspicious behavior.\n\n### Logical or Reasoning Flaws\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  The logic is straightforward and aligns with common practices. The version check for pyarrow uses `pyarrow_major <= 0 and pyarrow_minor < 16`, which might be unconventional but is not malicious. It correctly sets flags based on version, and exception handling is broad but standard.\n\n### Score Justification\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n  No malicious activity, payloads, or suspicious API calls are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n  The code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, the risk score should be very low, close to 0. The reports give values like 0.1 or 0.5, but considering the code's purpose and behavior, a score of **0.0** is more appropriate.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions\n- The code assumes that the version strings of pyarrow are well-formed and can be split into integers. If a malformed version string appears, it could raise an exception, but this is a minor concern and not malicious.\n- The broad exception handling could mask issues, but it doesn't introduce security risks.\n\n### Consistency of Scores\n- All reports give malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0.1, but given the benign nature, 0.0 would be more accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign utility for dependency management and DataFrame normalization. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The minor version check logic does not introduce vulnerabilities, and the broad exception handling is standard for import attempts.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nSet the risk score to **0.0** to reflect the benign nature accurately.",
