  "purpose": "A wrapper for managing AzureML rslex environment setup, dataflow execution, and utility functions for data processing.",
  "sources": "Input scripts (strings or objects), environment parameters, external module calls (rslex, threading, atexit, json).",
  "sinks": "External module functions, logging outputs, environment initialization routines.",
  "flows": "Input scripts are processed via _ensure_dataflow, then passed to rslex Executor methods; environment setup occurs with locks and cleanup routines.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Environment management uses standard locking and cleanup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured interface for executing dataflows with external dependencies. It handles untrusted input safely, manages environment initialization with thread locks, and performs cleanup. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or secrets are present. External calls are standard for such an environment. The scoring of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 aligns with the code's behavior and potential operational risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure wrapper around azureml.dataprep.rslex, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The low risk score is appropriate, and the code can be considered safe for use.",
