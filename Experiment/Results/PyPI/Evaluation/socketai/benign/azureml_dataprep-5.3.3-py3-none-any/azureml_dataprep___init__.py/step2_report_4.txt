  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a package initializer that imports and re-exports modules related to data prep in Azure ML. It does not process data directly.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows are present; it mainly sets up namespace exports.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation. The use of `extend_path` is standard for namespace packages.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a typical SDK setup, with no malicious signals.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate.**\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, it sets up an interface for data prep functions, importing modules without processing data directly.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data processing or network operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets. The secret management functions are standard for handling credentials.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard package setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — The risk score is slightly above zero but justified given secret management functions, which could be misused if exploited downstream. Still, within reason for this context.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on re-exporting modules for data handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data or network flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation. The functions and modules imported are standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Very low likelihood of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — Appropriate, given the presence of modules related to data sources and secret management, but nothing suspicious in this context.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Package initialization with module imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data or network flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard use of `extend_path` and module re-exports.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, setting up SDK components.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or obfuscated code; standard module setup.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate SDK initialization.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** None of the reports detect obfuscation; scores are 0.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports due to secret management functions, which is reasonable given their potential misuse downstream but are standard in secure SDKs.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard package setup, primarily re-exporting modules for an SDK.\n- No executable code, network activity, or data processing occurs here.\n- The presence of secret management functions is typical for SDKs handling credentials, not inherently malicious.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to 0.2 in some reports, justified by secret management functions but still low)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate; the code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation. The slight risk score reflects standard concerns around secret handling, but nothing indicates actual security issues.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe; no further action needed.",
