  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a package initializer, primarily importing and re-exporting modules for data prep in Azure ML. No direct data handling or network activity is present.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No explicit sinks; data flows occur in imported functions elsewhere.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code is standard for SDK setup, with no malicious signals. The only noteworthy point is the import of `use_rust_execution`, which is a performance optimization, not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with malware and security risk scores at 0.\n\n**Score Justification:** The report assigns malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1, it’s an import and setup script for data prep. It mentions secret management functions, which are standard.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data processing; functions like `read_csv` are imported but not used here.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis:** The presence of secret management functions warrants cautious downstream review but does not indicate malicious intent in this setup code.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, malware=0, securityRisk=0.2 (slightly cautious but not alarming).\n\n**Score Justification:** The malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. The securityRisk is slightly above zero, reflecting cautiousness due to secret management but not a real threat.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar import and re-export pattern, no direct data handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct untrusted data processing here.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis:** All modules serve legitimate purposes; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Very low malware and security risk scores, consistent with the code content.\n\n**Score Justification:** Correctly assigned malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Package setup with namespace extension, no data processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; standard package initialization.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious signals; typical SDK __init__.py pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Score Justification:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, module re-exporting.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data or network operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis:** Standard SDK setup, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Score Justification:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward import/export code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Very low, reflecting the nature of the code as an SDK setup module with no direct data handling or network activity.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, mainly due to secret management functions which are standard but warrant downstream review.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a typical, safe SDK setup module with no malicious or obfuscated code. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero or near-zero for malware and obfuscation, with very low security risk.\n\n**My final assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for secret management, but not alarming)",
