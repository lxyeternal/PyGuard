  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, considering the purpose, sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, and overall conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Package setup for Azure ML data prep; primarily re-exports.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Mainly imports and namespace extension; no data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; standard use of `extend_path`.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, no network activity, no obfuscation. The use of secret management functions is standard for handling credentials, not suspicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no indicators of malware or security risks.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)  \n- Risk: 0 (no security concern)  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above; setting up API surface for data prep library.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Imports modules, no direct data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; secret management functions are standard.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent; standard SDK setup.\n- **Conclusion:** Very low malware/security risk.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (slightly above zero, due to secret management functions, but justified as they are standard and necessary for secure handling of secrets).\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Re-exporting components for data prep.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Imports modules; no direct data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; standard module setup.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK component.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low, just a slight default for such setup code).\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Package initialization and import module.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Import statements only.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Typical package __init__.py; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (standard package setup).\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** SDK re-exporter, no data processing.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Importing modules, no execution logic.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Standard SDK module; no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are correct; code is straightforward and clear.  \n- **Risk Score:** The only slightly elevated risk score (0.2) in report 2 is justified due to the presence of secret management functions, which are standard but could be misused if the code were malicious. Given the context, this is a conservative but reasonable score.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code or backdoors)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is transparent and standard)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, mostly due to secret management functions, which are common in SDKs and handled securely)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured package initializer for an SDK. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
