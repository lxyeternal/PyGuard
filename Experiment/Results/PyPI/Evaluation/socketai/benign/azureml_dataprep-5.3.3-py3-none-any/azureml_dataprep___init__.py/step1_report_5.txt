{
  "purpose": "This module provides a comprehensive import interface for the Azure Machine Learning DataPrep SDK, re-exporting various components, types, functions, and utilities used for data preparation workflows in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module metadata (__path__, __name__, __version__), imports from multiple internal packages and submodules, and re-exports various classes, functions, and constants. No external or untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications. It primarily imports and exposes functions and classes for later use.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows within this code snippet, as it consists solely of import statements and module setup. No untrusted data processing occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The module imports are straightforward, and no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are found.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a module initializer and re-exporter for the Azure DataPrep SDK components. It imports various classes and functions from internal packages and defines __all__ for documentation. There is no code that executes logic, processes data, or performs network/file operations. The structure is standard for a package's __init__.py or main module file, with no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK module setup that exposes internal APIs for user consumption. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code patterns, and poses no security threats. It appears to be a legitimate component of the Azure DataPrep package.",
