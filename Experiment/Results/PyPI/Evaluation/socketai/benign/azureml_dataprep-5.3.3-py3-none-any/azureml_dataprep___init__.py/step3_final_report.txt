{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a package initializer for Azure Machine Learning data preparation, primarily importing and re-exporting modules for use in data workflows. It does not process data directly or perform network operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from various internal modules; no external input or data reading occurs within this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code does not handle or output data directly.",
  "flows": "The code sets up namespace exports; actual data flows occur in downstream functions and modules, not here.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. Use of extend_path is standard for namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SDK setup module, importing necessary components and extending namespace paths. It contains no executable logic, network activity, or data handling. The presence of secret management functions is standard for secure SDKs and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are appropriately set to malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1), mainly due to secret management functions which are standard in SDKs.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
