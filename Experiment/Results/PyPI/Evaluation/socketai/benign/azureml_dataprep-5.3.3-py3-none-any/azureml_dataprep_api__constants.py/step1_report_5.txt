  "purpose": "Define constants for Azure client ID, activity info key, error handling keys, and environment variable names related to Azure identity.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments for identifiers and environment variable names.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only sets constant values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded Azure client ID, which is a sensitive credential. Environment variable names are standard, but the hardcoded client ID is potentially sensitive if not meant for public exposure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several constants, including a hardcoded Azure client ID. Hardcoded credentials like client IDs can be security risks if exposed or misused. Environment variable names appear standard and are not suspicious by themselves. No functions, external calls, or data handling present. No malicious behavior detected in this static snippet. The main concern is the hardcoded client ID, which could be sensitive if not properly secured. Overall, the code does not exhibit malware or malicious intent, but the presence of a hardcoded credential warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily consists of constant definitions with one hardcoded Azure client ID, which could pose a security risk if exposed or misused. No malicious behavior or suspicious activity is evident beyond this credential exposure. It appears to be standard configuration code, but caution should be exercised regarding the hardcoded credential.",
