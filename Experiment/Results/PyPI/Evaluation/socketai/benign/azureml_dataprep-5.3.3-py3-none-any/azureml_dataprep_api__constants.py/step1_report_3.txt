  "purpose": "Define constants for Azure client identification and error handling, as well as environment variable names for identity management.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings for client ID and error keys; environment variable names for identity configuration.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected. Usage of environment variable names is standard, but the hardcoded client ID could be sensitive.",
  "analysis": "The code sets several string constants related to Azure client IDs, error keys, and environment variable names used for identity configuration. The presence of a hardcoded Azure client ID may be a security concern if it is sensitive, but it is a common practice for service identifiers and does not directly indicate malicious intent. There are no functions, network operations, or data manipulations present. No signs of malware or obfuscation are evident. Overall, the code appears to serve as configuration constants without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration snippet defining constants for Azure integration. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, but the hardcoded client ID should be evaluated in the context of the broader project for security best practices.",
