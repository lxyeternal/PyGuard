  "purpose": "Define constants for Azure client IDs, activity info, error codes, messages, and environment variable names related to identity management.",
  "sources": "Environment variable names: 'DEFAULT_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID', 'AZUREML_DATA_ACCESS_TENANT_ID', 'AZUREML_DATA_ACCESS_INTERACT_TIMEOUT', 'AZUREML_DATA_ACCESS_USE_DEVICE_CODE'.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of environment variables for sensitive configuration; no direct data sinks or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from sources to sinks; code only assigns constants and environment variable names.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets beyond the Azure client ID which is a public GUID, and no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of constant assignments for configuration parameters and environment variable names. The Azure client ID appears to be a public GUID, which is typical for Azure applications. Environment variable names are used for configuration and are not themselves sensitive data. There are no data flows, user inputs, or dynamic code execution observed. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to serve as a configuration or constants definition for Azure-related authentication and identity management. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The presence of a public Azure client ID is typical and not inherently malicious.",
