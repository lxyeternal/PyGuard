  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of configuration constants with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The only notable aspect is the hardcoded Azure client ID, which is a known public identifier used in Azure SDKs. While embedding such IDs is generally acceptable for public SDKs, it should be managed carefully to avoid misuse. The malware score remains 0, and the security risk score is low (around 0.2), consistent with best practices for public identifiers. No further action is necessary beyond standard secure handling of configuration data."
