  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Findings:** Constants for Azure auth, no suspicious code, only a public client ID.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (negligible)  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is configuration-related with no malicious activity. The public client ID is standard and not sensitive. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Findings:** Hardcoded Azure client ID is a security concern, but no malicious activity.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.3 (moderate concern due to hardcoded credential)  \n- **Assessment:** The main issue is the hardcoded client ID, which should ideally be stored securely. No malware or obfuscation detected. The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to above, constants and environment variable names, with a hardcoded client ID.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (lower than report 2, but still a concern)  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous, no malicious activity, just configuration with a hardcoded ID.\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Findings:** Configuration constants, environment variable names, public GUIDs, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, only configuration.\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Findings:** Similar pattern—constants, environment variables, hardcoded client ID.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.3  \n- **Assessment:** Same as others, primarily a security concern about the hardcoded credential.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports correctly identify no malware. The malware score should remain 0 across all reports.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; all code appears straightforward.\n\n- **Security risk:** The main concern is the hardcoded Azure client ID, which is a public GUID. While this is common in Azure public client applications, embedding it in source code can be a security concern if the client ID is sensitive or used in a privileged context. However, in Azure, such client IDs are often public and not secret.\n\n- **Scores consistency:** The malware scores are appropriately 0. None of the reports claim or imply malicious activity, so a malware score above 0. would be unjustified.\n\n- **Risk scores:** The security risk scores are moderate (0.2-0.3) mainly due to the hardcoded client ID. This is reasonable, but should not be overstated.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk score:** Given the presence of hardcoded credentials, a risk score of around 0.2-0.3 is appropriate, reflecting a security concern but not an active threat.\n\n**My recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to reflect the concern about hardcoded credentials, but not high since no malicious activity is present)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is configuration-focused, with no malicious intent. The main security concern is the hardcoded Azure client ID, which should be managed securely, but it does not constitute malware or malicious behavior.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2",
