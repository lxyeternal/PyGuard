  "purpose": "Define constants for Azure authentication and activity/error handling keys",
  "sources": "Hardcoded Azure client ID and string constants for activity and error keys, environment variable names for identity configuration",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data processing observed",
  "flows": "Constants are used for configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks evident",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials other than a public client ID, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code declares several string constants related to Azure authentication and error handling. The only potentially sensitive data is the hardcoded Azure client ID, which is a public client ID used for authentication flows. Environment variable names suggest configuration options but do not indicate malicious intent. No code execution, data transmission, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily defines constants for configuration purposes, with only a publicly known client ID, which is typical for Azure public client applications. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
