  "purpose": "This code manages Azure OAuth tokens by reading token data from a local cache file, refreshing tokens when necessary, and retrieving tokens for Azure CLI authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads from the token JSON cache file (accessTokens.json), environment variable 'AZURE_CONFIG_DIR', and the Azure OAuth token endpoint.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP POST requests to the Azure OAuth token endpoint with refresh tokens, and potentially returns tokens from the cache.",
  "flows": "Reads token data from local file -> Uses stored refresh tokens -> Sends refresh token requests to Azure endpoint -> Receives and processes token responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials besides the client ID imported from a constant; no suspicious or malicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs. Exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard OAuth token management for Azure, including reading tokens from a cache, refreshing tokens via HTTPS POST requests, and handling errors. No suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The URL endpoints are legitimate Azure endpoints. The only sensitive data handled are tokens and environment variables, which are used as intended. No malicious activity or sabotage evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to implement normal token management workflows for Azure OAuth authentication without any malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It does not contain hardcoded secrets beyond the client ID constant, nor does it perform any unauthorized actions.",
