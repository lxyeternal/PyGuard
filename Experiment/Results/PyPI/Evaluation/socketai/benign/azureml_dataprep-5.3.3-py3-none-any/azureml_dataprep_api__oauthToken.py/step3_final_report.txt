  "purpose": "Manage Azure OAuth tokens by reading from cache files and refreshing tokens via network requests to Azure endpoints.",
  "sources": "Reading token cache files, environment variables for config directory, network requests to Azure OAuth endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Network responses containing tokens, token data stored in local files.",
  "flows": "Read tokens from cache files -> Check token resource URLs -> If needed, refresh token via network request -> Return tokens.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Standard OAuth flow with legitimate endpoints.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard OAuth token management for Azure, reading tokens from local cache files, checking resource URLs, and refreshing tokens via HTTPS requests to Azure OAuth endpoints. It uses environment variables for configuration, handles tokens securely, and employs common libraries. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The network requests are to legitimate Azure endpoints, and token handling follows expected patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential minimal risks associated with token handling and network communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of Azure OAuth token management with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The scoring in the reports accurately reflects its benign nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
