  "purpose": "The code handles Azure OAuth token retrieval and management, including reading token cache files and refreshing tokens.",
  "sources": "os.getenv('AZURE_CONFIG_DIR'), open(tokenJsonFile), urlopen(request), and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "urlopen(request) potentially sending sensitive data over the network, reading token files that may contain secrets, and returning tokens.",
  "flows": "Reading token cache -> locating tokens -> possibly refreshing tokens -> returning tokens.",
  "anomalies": "Uses environment variable for config directory; token refresh process involves network request with sensitive tokens. No hardcoded secrets found; token refresh URL dynamically formatted. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages OAuth tokens by reading local cache files and refreshing tokens via network requests. It accesses environment variables for configuration directory paths and constructs OAuth requests including sensitive tokens. The network communication employs standard libraries and protocol adherence. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The token refresh process could be sensitive if tokens are compromised, but it is standard OAuth flow. No hardcoded credentials or unusual behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate token management operations related to Azure authentication. It does not contain malicious behavior or backdoors. The only notable risk is handling of tokens and network communication, which is expected for this functionality.",
