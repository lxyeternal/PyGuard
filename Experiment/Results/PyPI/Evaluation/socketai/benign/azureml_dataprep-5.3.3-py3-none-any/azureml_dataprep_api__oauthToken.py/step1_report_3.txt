{
  "purpose": "This code manages Azure OAuth tokens, reading token data from local cache files and refreshing tokens via Azure's OAuth endpoint.",
  "sources": "Reads token data from a JSON file (_read_tokens), environment variable (AZURE_CONFIG_DIR), and user input (token refresh process).",
  "sinks": "Sends token refresh requests over HTTPS to Azure OAuth endpoint; reads token data from local files.",
  "flows": "Reads tokens from file -> Checks token resource URLs -> Potentially makes HTTP POST request to Azure OAuth endpoint to refresh token -> Returns tokens.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets besides AZURE_CLIENT_ID; no obfuscated code; token refresh endpoint is constructed dynamically. No suspicious network behavior or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles token data, performs HTTPS requests for token refresh, and does not include suspicious or malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are observed. Token handling follows standard OAuth practices. The process relies on environment variables and user tokens, typical for Azure SDKs. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or system disruption, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard Azure token management logic with no malicious intent. It securely manages OAuth tokens, refreshes them via Azure's official endpoints, and does not exhibit malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
