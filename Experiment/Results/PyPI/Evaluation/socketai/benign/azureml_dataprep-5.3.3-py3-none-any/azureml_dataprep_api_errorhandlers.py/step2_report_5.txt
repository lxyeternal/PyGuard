  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines custom exceptions and error handling, reading error codes/messages from dictionaries, and using `session_id` for logging. No suspicious behavior or malicious code is detected.\n- **Findings:** The code is straightforward, with no external data flow, network activity, or code injection. The `session_id` is imported for logging purposes only.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware score = 0; security risk = 0. The logic is standard, and no malicious intent is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on structured error handling, no external data flow, and standard exception classes.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity. The `session_id` is used for context, not influenced externally.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware score = 0; security risk = 0.1 (minimal, likely due to external dependency). No suspicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard error handling framework, processing error responses, no network or external data operations.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The `session_id` inclusion is for logging.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware score = 0; security risk = 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern: exception classes, error response parsing, no external or malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious behavior; code is standard for error handling.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware score = 0; security risk = 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous reports, focused on exception classes, no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behaviors, no code injection, no external data flows.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware score = 0; security risk = 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No. All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard error handling module.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** None apparent. The code is well-structured, with proper exception classes and message formatting.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate. Security risks are minimal and consistent with the code's purpose.\n- **Malware justification:** No malicious activity is suggested or evident. The code does not perform network operations, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The reports do not rely on unfounded assumptions; they correctly interpret the code's purpose.\n- **Score consistency:** The scores are consistent with the code's nature—benign, error handling, logging, no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Estimated malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Estimated obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Estimated risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, due to external dependency and logging, but not a security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard error handling module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing assessments are accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Work-through summary:**  \n- The code is straightforward, focused on exception classes and error message formatting.  \n- No external or untrusted data is processed in a way that could cause harm.  \n- No malicious behaviors or backdoors are present.  \n- The scores are appropriate and justified based on the code's functionality.\n\n**Final verdict:** No security concerns; the code is safe.",
