  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes error handling classes that process error response dictionaries and extract fields like 'errorCode', 'message', and 'errorData'. Uses 'session_id' from a local module.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data flows, network calls, or system modifications. Exception objects are instantiated with data from error responses.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is standard for error handling, with messages including 'session_id' for context.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, straightforward error management code. No malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the lack of external data flow, network activity, or malicious behavior. The use of 'session_id' is standard for logging.\n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Overall, the code appears to be a well-structured error handling framework with no security concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on structured exception classes that process error responses and include 'session_id' for context.\n- No external network or file system operations, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- The import of 'session_id' is for logging purposes only.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard error handling code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar observations: error response processing, exception classes, inclusion of 'session_id' for traceability.\n- No suspicious patterns, no external data flows, no malicious behaviors.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous reports: exception classes, error response parsing, use of 'session_id' for logging.\n- No data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious constructs.\n- No obfuscation or backdoors detected.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware potential:** Zero, as no malicious behaviors, network calls, or code injections are present.\n- **Security risk:** Essentially none; the code is standard error handling.\n\n### Justification of Scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed review, the code is a standard, well-structured error handling module with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of 'session_id' is typical for logging and traceability. There are no signs of supply chain attacks, malicious code, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence provided.",
