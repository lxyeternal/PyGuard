  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, evaluating the reasoning, and ensuring consistency with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code defines custom exceptions and reads error codes, messages, and session_id.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data flow or network activity; only internal exception handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded; the code appears benign with a high confidence score.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (appropriate for benign error handling code)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on error handling and session_id usage.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transmission; internal exception processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or suspicious behaviors; session_id used for logging.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified; no malicious activity.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 — Slightly elevated, but given the benign nature, this is acceptable. No security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same core functionality; error response processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication; only exception instantiation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious intent; session_id for traceability.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Reasonable; no malicious behavior.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 — Acceptable, given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with previous; structured error handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data flow or system modifications.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; session_id used for logging.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; no malicious activity.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 — Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others; exception classes with session_id in messages.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or system modifications.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard error handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-supported; benign code.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 — Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, with a score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; scores are 0.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated at 0.1 in some reports due to the inclusion of session_id, but this is typical for logging and does not indicate a security risk.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, just logging-related, not indicative of a security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured error handling module with no malicious or suspicious behaviors. The scores assigned across reports are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
