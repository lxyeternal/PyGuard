{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for error handling within a data preparation or dataflow execution context, with some logging and error message formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads 'errorResponse' inputs in exception classes, accesses 'session_id' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "Formats error messages that include 'session_id'; no data sinks or untrusted data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Error response objects flow into exception constructors, where attributes are extracted and formatted into messages.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'session_id' from a local module in error messages; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behaviors. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of exception class definitions, formatting error messages, and logging. 'session_id' is imported from a local module and used in messages for traceability. No input sanitization or insecure data handling is evident. No code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration points are present. Exception handling is straightforward and does not perform any unsafe operations or malicious actions. The structure and purpose align with error management, not malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error handling module with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger data processing framework, focused on exception representation and messaging.",
