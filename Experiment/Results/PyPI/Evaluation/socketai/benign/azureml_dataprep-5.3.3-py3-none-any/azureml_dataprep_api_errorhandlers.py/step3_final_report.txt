{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and error handling functions for processing error responses, extracting error codes, messages, and session identifiers for logging and debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Error response dictionaries containing 'errorCode', 'message', 'errorData'; 'session_id' imported from a local module used for message context.",
  "sinks": "Formats error messages and raises exceptions; no external data transmission, network activity, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Error responses are passed into exception constructors; data flows from error response dictionaries to exception message formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; standard exception handling pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured error handling with custom exception classes that parse error response dictionaries, extract relevant error details, and include session identifiers for logging. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network calls, code injection, or data exfiltration. The use of 'session_id' is for traceability and logging, not external influence. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with standard practices for error management in Python. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured error handling module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It processes error responses, formats messages, and raises exceptions, with 'session_id' used solely for logging purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risk.",
