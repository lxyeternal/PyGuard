{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for constructing expression trees used in data preparation within Azure Machine Learning, including string trimming, rounding, stream info retrieval, datetime creation, and regex pattern matching.",
  "sources": "Input expressions provided to functions such as 'value', 'trim_left', 'trim_right', 'base_path', 'pattern', and 'value' parameters in methods like 'get_stream_name', 'get_stream_properties', 'create_datetime', etc.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write to external systems or execute untrusted code; it constructs expression objects for later evaluation by the Azure ML engine.",
  "flows": "Input expressions are validated and wrapped into expression objects, which are then used as arguments in identifier-based function calls; no direct execution or data leakage occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The regex class only compiles patterns and performs pattern matching, not code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of safe, well-structured utility functions for expression creation in Azure ML. All inputs are validated for type correctness, and no dangerous operations such as system calls, network access, or code execution are performed. The regex class encapsulates pattern matching with configurable flags, but does not execute arbitrary code. The functions generate expression trees that are evaluated later by the Azure ML engine, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from the potential misuse of user-provided regex patterns, but the code itself performs only pattern validation and matching setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility library for constructing expressions in Azure Machine Learning workflows. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is minimal and justified by the nature of expression building. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting slight inherent risk if inputs are malicious but no active threats are present.",
