  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility library for constructing expressions in Azure Machine Learning workflows. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is minimal and justified by the nature of expression building. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting slight inherent risk if inputs are malicious but no active threats are present."
