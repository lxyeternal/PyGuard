  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential risks, and scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions for constructing expression trees in Azure Machine Learning.\n- All inputs are validated for type correctness.\n- The functions generate nested InvokeExpression objects calling specific identifiers.\n- The regex class handles pattern matching with configurable flags.\n- No direct execution of untrusted code, network activity, or file manipulation is evident.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present.\n- The code appears to be a legitimate SDK utility for data transformation.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is standard, with no malicious behavior. The slight security risk score (0.1) accounts for the potential misuse of regex patterns, but since regex patterns are user-provided and not executed as code, this is minimal.\n- **Conclusion:** The scoring seems reasonable; the malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1\n- **Assessment:** The report emphasizes the benign nature, standard validation, and lack of malicious behavior. The zero security risk is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, the functions are safe wrappers. The slight risk score accounts for the fact that regex patterns could be crafted maliciously, but since they are not executed directly, this remains low.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is a safe utility library. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes that the functions are for expression construction, with no direct unsafe operations. The small security risk score reflects the potential for misusing user-provided regex patterns, but no actual malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** The scoring is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **General Justification for Scores:**\n\n- **Malware score (0):** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Code is clear, straightforward, and well-structured.\n- **Security risk (0.1):** Slightly elevated due to the potential misuse of regex patterns or expression inputs, but no active threats.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\nGiven the thorough review, **the code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious intent**. The minor security risk score reflects potential misuse rather than actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent in their assessment. The code is a standard, safe utility for expression creation in Azure ML, with minimal risk stemming from user-provided patterns or inputs, but no actual malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
