{
  "purpose": "Provides higher-level expression functions for data preparation in Azure Machine Learning, including string manipulation, stream info retrieval, datetime creation, regex matching, and stream info creation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as 'value', 'trim_left', 'trim_right', 'pattern', 'value' for regex, and workspace details.",
  "sinks": "Uses untrusted input data for regex operations, stream info, and string manipulation which could potentially be manipulated if inputs are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and wrapped into expression objects, then passed to identifier-based functions which generate expression trees; no direct execution or data leakage occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors. The code uses standard pattern of expression generation. The regex class does not expose any potentially dangerous operations other than matching and extracting records. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for creating expression objects for data manipulation, stream handling, datetime creation, and regex operations in a structured manner. All inputs are validated for their types. The regex class properly validates the pattern type and parameters. No unsafe code execution, data leaks, or malicious network activity are present. The functions rely on expression trees, not executing code directly. There are no indications of backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured library for constructing expressions in Azure ML. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided implementation. The regex class handles pattern matching without exposing dangerous operations. Overall, the code seems safe and legitimate.",
