{
  "purpose": "The code provides higher-level expression functions for data preparation tasks in Azure Machine Learning, such as string trimming, stream property retrieval, date-time creation, and regex operations.",
  "sources": "Function parameters accepting Expression, StrExpressionLike, BoolExpressionLike, and other values; internal _assert_expression and _ensure_expression functions.",
  "sinks": "InvokeExpression calls executing identifiers like 'AdjustColumnPrecision', 'TrimStringTransform', 'GetResourceName', 'GetPortablePath', 'GetStreamProperties', 'GetStreamsProperties', 'GetStreamInfo', 'CreateDateTime', 'CreateStreamInfo', 'RegexIsMatch', 'RegexRecordExtractor', and 'CreateHttpStreamInfo'.",
  "flows": "Inputs are processed via _assert_expression and _ensure_expression, then passed into InvokeExpression, which calls internal engine functions for data manipulation and stream info retrieval; regex methods use pattern matching functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs observed. All functions appear to be standard data transformation utilities. No suspicious network activity, file access, or external system calls are evident. The regex class is configurable but limited to pattern matching; no malicious regex patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a set of wrappers for creating expressions used in Azure ML data prep, with validation and conversion steps. All functions rely on internally defined expression objects and validation. The regex class provides pattern matching capabilities without executing arbitrary code or external commands. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or file manipulation appears present. The code seems to be well-structured, focusing on expression creation, with no malicious or harmful intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign library of expression functions for data transformation in Azure Machine Learning pipelines. There are no signs of malware, malicious backdoors, or security risks. It functions as a standard SDK utility without external data leaks or harmful behavior.",
