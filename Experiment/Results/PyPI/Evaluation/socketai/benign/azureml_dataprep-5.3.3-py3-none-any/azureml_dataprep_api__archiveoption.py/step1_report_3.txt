  "purpose": "Define a class for archive options including archive type and glob pattern.",
  "sources": "Import from .engineapi.typedefinitions import ArchiveType.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class initialization stores parameters internally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a type definition and defines a straightforward class with an initializer that sets attributes. There are no data processing, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. The class appears to be a part of a larger system for handling archive options. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code is simple, with no input/output operations or external data handling that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard class definition for managing archive options with no indicators of malicious intent or security issues. It appears safe and non-suspicious.",
