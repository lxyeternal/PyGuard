  "purpose": "Define a class for archive options with specified archive type and entry pattern.",
  "sources": "Imports ArchiveType from a local module; class constructor parameters (archive_type, entry_glob).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no system or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; parameters are used internally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data container class with no external input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It imports a type definition from a local module, and the class simply assigns provided parameters to attributes. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of configuration options.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions solely as a data structure without external interactions or suspicious patterns.",
