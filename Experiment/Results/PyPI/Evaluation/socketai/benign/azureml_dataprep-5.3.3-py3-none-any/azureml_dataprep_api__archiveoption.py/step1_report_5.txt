  "purpose": "Define a class ArchiveOptions to specify options for handling archive files, including type and entry pattern.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.engineapi.typedefinitions) for ArchiveType.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; class initialization only sets attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a type definition, then defines a simple class with an initializer that sets two attributes. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network operations, and no code execution. The use of type hints and docstrings suggests good coding practices but does not raise security concerns. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition for managing archive options. There is no malicious intent or security risk detected. It appears to be standard, benign code.",
