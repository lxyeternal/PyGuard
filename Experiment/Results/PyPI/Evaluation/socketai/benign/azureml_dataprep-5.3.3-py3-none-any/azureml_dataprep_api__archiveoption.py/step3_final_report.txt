{
  "purpose": "Defines a configuration class 'ArchiveOptions' with attributes for archive type and entry pattern.",
  "sources": "Import of 'ArchiveType' from a local module; constructor parameters 'archive_type' and 'entry_glob'.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; no I/O or network operations.",
  "flows": "Assignment of constructor parameters directly to instance attributes; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definition with clear attributes; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple data container class with no external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It imports a type definition and assigns parameters to attributes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose appears to be configuration or metadata storage, which is inherently low risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat. The reports accurately assess the code as safe, with appropriate scoring. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
