{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'warnings' module and the 'ZabbixAPI' class from the 'pyzabbix' library, then issues a deprecation warning indicating that this module is deprecated in favor of 'pyzabbix'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the '__name__' variable to generate the deprecation warning message.",
  "sinks": "The warning function outputs a warning message, which could be displayed to users or logs. No data leaks or security-sensitive sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The source '__name__' flows into the format string used in warnings.warn, which then outputs a message; no further data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code only issues a deprecation warning; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing a library and issuing a deprecation warning. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data leaks, no execution of untrusted code, nor any malicious actions. It simply informs users of deprecation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a deprecation notice. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
