{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'warnings' module and the 'ZabbixAPI' class from the 'pyzabbix' library, and issues a deprecation warning about the module itself.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'warnings' module (built-in) and from the 'pyzabbix' library (imported).",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the 'warnings.warn' function, which outputs a deprecation warning message.",
  "flows": "The source (imported modules) leads to the 'warnings.warn' call, which then outputs a message indicating deprecation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; the warning message references a deprecation notice and does not execute malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, then issues a deprecation warning about the module itself. No data leaks, input handling, or malicious activities are present. The warning does not invoke network calls or execute malicious code. The import and warning are standard Python practices for deprecating modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple deprecation warning with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard practice to inform users about deprecated modules. No malicious activity or security concerns are detected.",
