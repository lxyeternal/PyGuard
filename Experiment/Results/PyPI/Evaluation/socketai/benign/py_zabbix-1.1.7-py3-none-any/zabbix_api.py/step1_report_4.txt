{
  "purpose": "This code imports the 'warnings' module and the 'ZabbixAPI' class from the 'pyzabbix' package, and issues a deprecation warning about the module itself.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the module import statements and the __name__ variable to generate the deprecation warning message.",
  "sinks": "The warning function outputs a DeprecationWarning message, which is a benign informational message intended for developers or users.",
  "flows": "Import statements do not process untrusted data; the only flow is the creation of a warning message based on module name.",
  "anomalies": "The code issues a deprecation warning with a formatted message that includes the module name, which is standard practice. No hidden or suspicious behavior is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and issues a deprecation warning indicating that the current module is deprecated in favor of 'pyzabbix'. The warning is generated using the module's __name__ variable, which is standard. There are no code injections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The code is minimal and serves a transitional or informational purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, serves a benign purpose of issuing a deprecation warning, and contains no malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to standard practices without anomalies.",
