  "sources": "The import of 'warnings' and 'ZabbixAPI' from 'pyzabbix'.",
  "sinks": "The 'warnings.warn()' call which outputs the deprecation message.",
  "flows": "Import statements lead to the 'warnings.warn()' call, which outputs the static message containing '__name__'.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and issues a static deprecation warning referencing '__name__'. No malicious code, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. The warning message is static and safe. The code follows standard practices and does not process untrusted input or perform network operations. All signals indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard deprecation warning with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the analysis.",
