{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'warnings' module and the 'ZabbixAPI' class from the 'pyzabbix' library, then issues a deprecation warning indicating the module should be replaced by 'pyzabbix'.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'warnings' and 'pyzabbix.ZabbixAPI'. The warning.warn call also reads the module's '__name__' attribute.",
  "sinks": "The 'warnings.warn' function generates a warning message, which may be logged or displayed; the message contains the module's name.",
  "flows": "Import statements execute first, then the warning message is generated during runtime when the module is imported or loaded.",
  "anomalies": "The code issues a deprecation warning referencing the module name; no hardcoded credentials or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python modules and a third-party library, then issues a deprecation warning. The warning message is generic and informs users about deprecation, not containing sensitive or malicious content. There are no indications of malicious data handling, code injection, or suspicious activity. The use of warnings is standard practice for deprecation notices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to inform users about deprecation. There is no malicious behavior or security risk present.",
