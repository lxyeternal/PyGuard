  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core code: importing 'warnings' and 'pyzabbix.ZabbixAPI', then issuing a deprecation warning referencing the module's `__name__`.\n- No report indicates any malicious activity, suspicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The code is minimal, standard practice for deprecation notices, and does not process untrusted input or handle sensitive data.\n- The warning message is static and based on the module's `__name__`, which is safe.\n\n**Confirming issues in the code:**\n- The code matches the description across all reports.\n- No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, code injection, or obfuscation, are present.\n- The code's logic is straightforward and benign.\n\n**Scores and their appropriateness:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0\n  - Confidence: 1\n- These scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- The only potential \"risk\" might be if the warning message could be exploited, but since it only outputs a static message with the module name, this is not a concern.\n- No evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, serves as a deprecation notice, and poses no security risk.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Note:** Given the nature of the code, I agree with the current scores. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard deprecation warning with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The current scores are justified and appropriate.",
