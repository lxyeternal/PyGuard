  "purpose": "Declare the version of the Python package/module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string '1.1.7' to the variable __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; simple assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line assigning a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no logic, data processing, external input/output, or dynamic code. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with appropriate scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious constructs support this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate and consistent; no adjustments are necessary.",
