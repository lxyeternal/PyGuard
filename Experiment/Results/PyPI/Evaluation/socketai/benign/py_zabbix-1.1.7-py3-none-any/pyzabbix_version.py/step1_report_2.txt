  "analysis": "The code solely assigns a version string to the variable '__version__'. It is a common practice in Python packages to specify the package version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no external data reading, no obfuscated code, or suspicious activity detected. This is standard metadata declaration with no security implications.",
