  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and compare them to the original code:\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\n__version__ = '1.1.7'\n```\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It assigns a version string to the variable `__version__`.\n- It contains no functions, logic, data processing, external data sources, or dynamic behavior.\n- It is a common practice in Python packages to declare version info this way.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as a benign version declaration.\n- **Errors or flaws in the report logic:** No errors are evident; all reports consistently describe the code as a simple version string assignment.\n- **Scores given:**\n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Security Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n### Critical review:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all conclusions are justified based on the code's simplicity.\n- The scores align with the code's nature: minimal, straightforward, and standard.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the code is only a version string assignment, it cannot be malicious or obfuscated.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**All scores are reasonable and justified.**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the code's nature.",
