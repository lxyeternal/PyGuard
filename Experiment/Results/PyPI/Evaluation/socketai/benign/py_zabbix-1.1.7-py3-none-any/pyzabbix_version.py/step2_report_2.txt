  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content**: The code is a single line:\n   ```python\n   __version__ = '1.1.7'\n   ```\n   This is a standard practice in Python packages to declare the version of the module.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is just a version string assignment.\n   - There are no signs of data processing, input/output, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n   - No external data sources or sinks are involved.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n3. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes in Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - No flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n   - Obfuscated: 0, Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0 — all consistent with the code content.\n   - The scores seem reasonable and justified.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification**:\n   - Since the code only assigns a version string, the risk score should be 0.\n   - Malware score should also be 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n   - The reports' scores align with this assessment.\n\n6. **Potential Assumptions or Claims**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as standard version declaration.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made, which is correct.\n\n7. **Overall Evaluation**:\n   - The code is entirely benign.\n   - The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis is a straightforward, harmless version declaration with no security concerns.",
