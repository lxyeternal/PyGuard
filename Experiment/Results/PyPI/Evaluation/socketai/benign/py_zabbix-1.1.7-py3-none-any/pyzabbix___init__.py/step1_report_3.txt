  "purpose": "Import statements for modules related to Zabbix API interaction and data sending",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .api and .sender",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in these lines",
  "flows": "No data flow as this is only import statements; no runtime data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing specific classes and functions from local modules. There are no data inputs, no untrusted data sources, and no data processing or network activity. The imported classes and functions appear to be standard for interacting with Zabbix API, and nothing suspicious is evident in these lines. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Since this is only a fragment with import statements, it offers limited context, but nothing suspicious is detectable here.",
  "conclusion": "The code fragment contains only benign import statements related to Zabbix API and sender functionalities. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
