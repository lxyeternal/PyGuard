  "purpose": "Importing classes and functions related to Zabbix API interactions and data sending mechanisms",
  "sources": "No input data reading or data collection observed in this snippet",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks observed in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks within this code snippet",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward import statements; no anomalies or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules (api and sender). There are no function calls, data processing, or dynamic code execution present. The imports include classes and functions that facilitate API interaction and data transmission, which are standard for such modules. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior indicators are detected. The minimal code does not include any suspicious patterns or potential attack vectors.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a typical import statement block for a Python module related to Zabbix API operations. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious activity and appears to be safe.",
