{
  "purpose": "This code imports internal modules related to Zabbix API and sender functionalities, likely as part of a larger monitoring library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.api' and '.sender' modules, which are internal to the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only imports modules without processing data.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this snippet; it solely imports classes and functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, with no executable logic, network activity, or data handling. The imported modules are standard for a Zabbix client library. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The minimal nature of the code indicates a benign purpose, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The import statements are standard and do not pose any threat. All reports correctly identify this, and no modifications to the scores are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
