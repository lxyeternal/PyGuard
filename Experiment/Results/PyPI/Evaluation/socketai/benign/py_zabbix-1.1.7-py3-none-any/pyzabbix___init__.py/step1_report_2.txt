  "purpose": "Import modules and classes related to Zabbix API interaction and data sending.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .api and .sender.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data outputs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is visible in this minimal import code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected; only import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, importing classes and functions for API communication and data transmission. There are no functions, variables, or executable code present. The code appears to be part of a larger package designed to interact with Zabbix, a monitoring system. Since it does not perform any data handling, processing, or network operations directly, there are no immediate security concerns or malicious behaviors evident at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is harmless and only imports components necessary for Zabbix API interactions. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are detected within these import statements.",
