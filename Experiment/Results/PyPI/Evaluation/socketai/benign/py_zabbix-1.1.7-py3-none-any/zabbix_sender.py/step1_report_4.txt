{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to import modules related to Zabbix monitoring and issue a deprecation warning indicating that the current module should no longer be used.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'warnings' and 'pyzabbix' modules, and the call to warnings.warn() with a formatted string.",
  "sinks": "The warning message itself, which is a string; no data sink is evident as there is no data processing or network operation.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> Generate warning message",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the warning message is static and formatted with a module name, which is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and issues a deprecation warning indicating that the current module should be replaced with 'pyzabbix'. The warning message is constructed dynamically with __name__, which is a standard practice. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or security issues. The code performs minimal operations and appears legitimate and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious snippet issuing a deprecation warning about the module. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
