{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning for the module, indicating that 'pyzabbix' should be used instead.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name (__name__) and imports from the 'pyzabbix' library.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn function outputs a warning message; this is a benign logging mechanism.",
  "flows": "The code uses the __name__ variable to generate a deprecation message and calls warnings.warn to display it.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code performs a straightforward deprecation warning. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from the 'pyzabbix' library and issues a deprecation warning indicating that the module is deprecated. The warning message dynamically includes the module name using __name__. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or data leakage beyond standard logging of a deprecation notice. The structure is simple and typical for deprecation notices, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard deprecation warning implementation with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to inform users about the deprecation of the module and recommends an alternative. There are no signs of malware or security issues.",
