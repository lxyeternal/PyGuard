{
  "purpose": "The code imports the warnings module and specific classes from the pyzabbix library, then issues a deprecation warning indicating the module name is deprecated in favor of 'pyzabbix'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __name__ variable for module identification and the import statements for 'warnings' and 'pyzabbix' modules.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the warnings.warn() function which outputs a deprecation warning message.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, then executing warnings.warn() with a formatted message including __name__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the warning message is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious content.",
  "analysis": "The script simply issues a deprecation warning about the module name, using standard Python functions and imports. The import of 'pyzabbix' modules indicates intended usage of the Zabbix API, but no malicious or suspicious activity is present. There are no obfuscated elements, external data flows, or harmful code behaviors. The code performs a benign action to inform users about deprecation status.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, primarily serving to warn users about deprecation. It does not contain malware or security risks. The presence of pyzabbix imports suggests usage of Zabbix API functionalities, but nothing malicious is evident.",
