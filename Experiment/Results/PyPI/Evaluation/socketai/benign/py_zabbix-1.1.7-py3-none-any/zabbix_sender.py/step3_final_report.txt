{
  "purpose": "Issue a deprecation warning indicating the module is deprecated and suggest using 'pyzabbix' instead.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'pyzabbix' and the __name__ variable used in the warning message.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn() function outputs the deprecation message; no other sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Import statements provide the context; the warning message flows to the user via standard output.",
  "anomalies": "None; static warning message, no dynamic or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'warnings' and specific classes from 'pyzabbix', then issues a deprecation warning with a message including __name__. The code is static, straightforward, and does not process untrusted data, perform network activity, or contain obfuscation. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are present. The warning is a standard practice for deprecation notices, and the code's purpose is solely informational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a deprecation warning with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward implementation. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
