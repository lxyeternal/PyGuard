  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is minimal, importing specific classes from the 'pyzabbix' library and issuing a DeprecationWarning with a static message that includes the module name.\n- There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The warning is a standard practice to inform users about deprecation.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or manipulate sensitive information.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies that the code imports modules and issues a deprecation warning.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; straightforward warning.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, security risk is 0, consistent with benign code.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Fully consistent. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above; issues a deprecation warning.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent; standard deprecation pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward, benign code.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same, deprecation warning.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (slightly less, but still high)\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same, warning about deprecation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; imports suggest usage of Zabbix API but nothing suspicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores for malware and security risk are all zero, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The deprecation warning is standard and does not introduce any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as there's no security threat.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, and all reports correctly reflect that. No changes to scores or reasoning are necessary.",
