{
  "purpose": "This code imports necessary modules and issues a deprecation warning for the module itself, informing users to use 'pyzabbix' instead.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name (__name__) for the warning message.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not perform any data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from input sources to sinks; only a warning message is generated based on the module name.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard warning and specific classes from the 'pyzabbix' library, then issues a DeprecationWarning indicating that the module is deprecated. The warning message dynamically includes the module's name. There are no data manipulations, network activity, or suspicious behaviors. The code is minimal and standard for deprecation notices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and primarily serves to warn users about module deprecation. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
