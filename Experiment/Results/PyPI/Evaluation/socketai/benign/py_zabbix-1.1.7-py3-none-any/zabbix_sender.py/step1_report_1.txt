{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules and issues a deprecation warning for a module named 'pyzabbix'.",
  "sources": "The source reads the module import statements and the warning message string.",
  "sinks": "The warning function may output to standard error or logs, but no untrusted data is processed or written elsewhere.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; the warning is static and does not involve dynamic data from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The warning message is static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from the 'pyzabbix' package and issues a DeprecationWarning with a static message indicating the module is deprecated. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The warning is standard practice to inform users about deprecation and does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and benign, primarily serving to notify users about deprecation. There are no malicious behaviors or security concerns detected.",
