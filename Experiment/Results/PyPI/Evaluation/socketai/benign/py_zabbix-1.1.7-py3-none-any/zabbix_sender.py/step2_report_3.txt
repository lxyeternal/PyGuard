  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code imports modules (`warnings`, `pyzabbix`) and issues a deprecation warning.\n   - The warning message is static or dynamically generated with `__name__`.\n   - There are no data flows from untrusted sources, no network activity, no data processing, and no user input involved.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and serves solely as a deprecation notice.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies:**\n   - No report indicates any suspicious or malicious behavior.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or code injection detected.\n   - The code does not perform any network calls, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No signs of malware are present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, justified because the code is benign and does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Issues & Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based solely on static code review.\n   - The dynamic warning message does not introduce risks, as it uses `__name__`, which is safe.\n\n5. **Score Recommendations:**\n   - The scores seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n   - Given the benign nature, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code's purpose is solely to warn about deprecation.\n   - No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present.\n   - The use of `pyzabbix` imports indicates intended functionality but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature. No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a simple, standard deprecation warning mechanism with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are needed.",
