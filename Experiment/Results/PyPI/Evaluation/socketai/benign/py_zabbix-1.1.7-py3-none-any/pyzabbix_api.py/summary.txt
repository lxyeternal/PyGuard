  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent Python client for Zabbix API interaction. No malware, obfuscation, or sabotage is detected. The main security concern is the intentional disabling of SSL verification, which should be used cautiously. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3-0.4). These scores are consistent with the analysis and reflect the code's legitimate purpose with a known security trade-off."
