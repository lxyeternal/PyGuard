  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, cryptographically sound implementation of an encrypted socket with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The only notable issue is the improper 'raise' statement, which should be fixed for robustness. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks."
