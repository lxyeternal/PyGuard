  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for distributing a package named 'gogogolokl'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; package metadata defined in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content into long_description; no data flows leading to vulnerabilities",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns; code is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The reports are empty, providing no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The code does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or contain hidden behaviors. The absence of dependencies and the standard structure further reduce risk. Given the lack of findings, the malware, obfuscation, and risk scores should all be zero.",
  "conclusion": "The package is benign, with no detected malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The empty reports do not indicate any issues. The overall supply chain security risk is minimal, and the scores should reflect that.",
