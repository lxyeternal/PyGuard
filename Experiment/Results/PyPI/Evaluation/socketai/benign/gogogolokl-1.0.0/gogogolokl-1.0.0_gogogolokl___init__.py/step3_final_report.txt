  "sources": "Reads from command-line arguments, environment variables, and potentially external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential network connections, file operations, or dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or system commands), possibly via eval/exec or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscated variable names, complex structures, or lack of code clarity.",
  "analysis": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common indicators of malicious intent. Absence of code in some reports limits analysis, but where present, suspicious patterns justify higher malware and obfuscation scores. The scores are consistent with the evidence: benign code receives zero scores, while obfuscated or dynamically executed code receives moderate suspicion scores. The risk scores align with the potential for exploitation based on obfuscation and dynamic features. Confidence levels are moderate to high where evidence is clear; otherwise, they reflect uncertainty.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are generally accurate and consistent. Obfuscation and dynamic execution features justify moderate suspicion scores, while absence of code results in zero scores. Minor adjustments could be made to risk and malware scores for more conservative estimates, especially in ambiguous cases. Overall, the assessments are well-founded and align with the evidence presented.",
