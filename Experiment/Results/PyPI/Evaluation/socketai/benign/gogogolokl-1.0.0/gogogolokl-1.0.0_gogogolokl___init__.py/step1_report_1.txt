  "sources": "The code does not explicitly read input or data from external sources within the visible fragments.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks where untrusted data is processed in a way that could lead to data leaks or security effects, based on the provided code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable due to the absence of actual code or data handling sections.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual language features, are visible in the provided content. The code appears to be absent or incomplete.",
  "analysis": "The provided input contains no executable code, data processing, or logic to analyze. Without actual code, it is impossible to identify sources, sinks, or malicious behavior. All sections of the code are either missing or empty, preventing a meaningful review.",
  "conclusion": "No code was provided for review, and therefore no malicious behavior or security issues can be assessed. The absence of code limits the ability to determine if there are security risks or malicious intent.",
