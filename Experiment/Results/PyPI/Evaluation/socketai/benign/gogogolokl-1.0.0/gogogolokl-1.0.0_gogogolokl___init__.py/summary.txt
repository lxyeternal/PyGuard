  "conclusion": "The reports are generally accurate and consistent. Obfuscation and dynamic execution features justify moderate suspicion scores, while absence of code results in zero scores. Minor adjustments could be made to risk and malware scores for more conservative estimates, especially in ambiguous cases. Overall, the assessments are well-founded and align with the evidence presented."
