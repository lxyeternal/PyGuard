  "purpose": "A utility function to read lines from a file in reverse order without loading the entire file into memory.",
  "sources": "File open(), seek(), read(), tell() operations to access file data from the end.",
  "sinks": "Yield statements output lines; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "File seek to end -> read chunks -> split into lines -> yield lines in reverse order.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard reverse line reader with no obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of reverse reading a file line-by-line using standard Python file operations. It does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or external network activity. The logic correctly handles partial lines at chunk boundaries. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code is well-structured, with no anomalies or suspicious behaviors. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, assign malware scores of 0, and low security risk scores. Confidence levels are high, and the scores are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for reverse reading files. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
