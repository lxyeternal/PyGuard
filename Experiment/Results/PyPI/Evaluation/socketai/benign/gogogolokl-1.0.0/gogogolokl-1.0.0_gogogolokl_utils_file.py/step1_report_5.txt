{
  "purpose": "Read lines from a file in reverse order efficiently using a generator.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a file using the open() function and file.seek() methods.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs lines via yield, which could potentially be used to process untrusted data downstream.",
  "flows": "File is opened -> file.seek() retrieves file size -> file.read() reads chunks from the end -> lines are processed and yielded in reverse order.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious logic are present. The implementation is a known pattern for reverse reading a file. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of reverse file reading, leveraging standard file operations. It uses seek() and read() to process file chunks from the end to the beginning, splitting on newline characters and yielding lines in reverse order. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The functions and operations are typical for file handling. No anomalies like hardcoded credentials or suspicious code flow are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard, legitimate task of reverse reading a file without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and intended for use cases requiring reverse file processing.",
