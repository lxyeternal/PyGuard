  "purpose": "Read a file in reverse line order",
  "sources": "Reading from the file using open() and file.seek() methods",
  "sinks": "File read operations, file.seek(), and string manipulations",
  "flows": "open() -> file.seek() -> file.read() -> string.split() -> yield statements",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures; the logic is a standard reverse line reader",
  "analysis": "The code implements a reverse line reader for files by reading fixed-size chunks from the end of the file and splitting them into lines. It uses standard file operations and string methods without any suspicious behavior. There are no network connections, data leaks, or obfuscated components. It simply performs a known file processing task with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of reading a file in reverse line order. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It relies solely on standard library functions and common programming patterns.",
