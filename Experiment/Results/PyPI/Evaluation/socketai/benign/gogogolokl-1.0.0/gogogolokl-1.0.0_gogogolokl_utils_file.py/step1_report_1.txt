  "purpose": "Read lines from a file in reverse order, line by line.",
  "sources": "File reading operations: open(), file.seek(), file.read(), file.tell()",
  "sinks": "No direct sink involving untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "File opened -> seek to end -> read buffer -> split into lines -> yield lines in reverse order",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no unusual obfuscation or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a reverse line reader by reading chunks from the end of the file and yielding lines in reverse. It uses standard file operations with no external network or system modifications. The logic appears straightforward and consistent with a common reverse reading pattern. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected, and no secrets or backdoors are present. The code does not perform any insecure operations, nor does it manipulate data in a harmful manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard reverse line reader implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a benign utility function for processing files backwards.",
