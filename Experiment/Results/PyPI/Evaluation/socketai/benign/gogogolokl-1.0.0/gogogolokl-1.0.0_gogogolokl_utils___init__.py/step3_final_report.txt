  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, user input, parameters, or system data; data flows to network, files, subprocesses, or logs.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, subprocess executions, environment variables, logs.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) to sinks (network, files, subprocesses).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or unusual control flow detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign, using standard libraries and patterns. No malicious indicators such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage are present. The absence of obfuscation and suspicious code constructs supports a low malware likelihood. The data flows are typical for legitimate applications. Confidence in benign nature is high (0.9). The security risk score of 0.2 is slightly conservative; given the benign analysis, a lower score (e.g., 0.1) would better reflect minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate, though the security risk could be slightly lowered to better match the benign assessment. Overall, the dependency is considered safe with low risk.",
