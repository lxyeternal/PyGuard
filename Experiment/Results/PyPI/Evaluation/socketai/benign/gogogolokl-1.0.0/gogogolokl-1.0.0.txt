      "conclusion": "The reports are generally accurate and consistent. Obfuscation and dynamic execution features justify moderate suspicion scores, while absence of code results in zero scores. Minor adjustments could be made to risk and malware scores for more conservative estimates, especially in ambiguous cases. Overall, the assessments are well-founded and align with the evidence presented."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, cryptographically sound implementation of an encrypted socket with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The only notable issue is the improper 'raise' statement, which should be fixed for robustness. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks."
