{
  "purpose": "Provide a utility function for error handling and formatting error messages with optional line number information.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the Exception object (`error`) and system traceback information via `sys.exc_info()`.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present. The function formats error messages but does not output or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Exception data is processed within the function; no external data flows or untrusted data to sinks are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and typical for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The function captures an exception object, extracts its class name and message, and optionally appends the line number where the exception occurred using traceback info. It employs try-except blocks to handle potential errors in accessing traceback data. There is no indication of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The code appears to be a standard error handler with no malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for formatting exception messages, with no signs of malware or security risks. It is a typical pattern for error reporting in Python applications.",
