{
  "purpose": "The function 'errors' formats and returns a string describing an exception, including its type, message, and optionally the line number where it occurred.",
  "sources": "Reads exception object 'error' and system traceback information using sys.exc_info()",
  "sinks": "Formats error message string, potentially for logging or display",
  "flows": "Error object is used to extract details; traceback info is retrieved for line number if 'line' is True",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The traceback extraction is standard for debugging purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a utility to generate a human-readable error message, extracting exception type, message, and optionally the line number. It uses standard library functions sys.exc_info() and traceback.extract_tb() in a typical manner. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is present. The function appears to be a straightforward error handler intended for debugging or logging. The use of exception handling around traceback extraction adds robustness but does not introduce any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe error formatting function with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any dangerous operations or data leaks.",
