  "sources": "Reading exception information (__class__.__name__, args, sys.exc_info(), traceback.extract_tb())",
  "sinks": "Constructed error message string returned by the function",
  "flows": "Exception occurs -> error class and args are read -> traceback info is extracted -> message is constructed and returned",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard exception handling logic",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that formats exception details into a string. It accesses exception class name, arguments, and traceback info to include line number if available. All data accessed are from the exception object itself or standard sys and traceback modules. No hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The purpose is to generate error messages, with optional line number inclusion. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The logic is straightforward and standard for error reporting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error message formatter with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely accesses exception details and constructs a descriptive message without executing any harmful actions.",
