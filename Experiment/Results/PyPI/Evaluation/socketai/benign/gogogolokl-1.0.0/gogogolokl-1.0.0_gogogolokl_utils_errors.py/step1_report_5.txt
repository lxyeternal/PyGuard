  "purpose": "The function 'errors' provides a formatted error message string for exceptions, including optional line number details.",
  "sources": "Reads the exception object 'error' and optionally retrieves traceback information using sys.exc_info() and traceback.extract_tb().",
  "sinks": "Formats and returns the error message string; no untrusted data is written or transmitted outside the scope.",
  "flows": "Exception object -> error class and message; traceback info -> optional line number in message.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious logic; the code is straightforward error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that captures an exception, extracts its class and message, and optionally appends the line number where the exception occurred. It uses sys.exc_info() and traceback.extract_tb() to obtain traceback details. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious data flows. The function is a standard error formatting utility, with exception handling for its own internal calls. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical error handling utility designed to format exception information, including optional line numbers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
