{
  "purpose": "Support for resumable, simple, multipart, and XML multipart uploads to Google APIs, managing request preparation, transmission, and response handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as data, metadata, stream objects, and request configuration; transport.request method for network communication.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests via transport.request; response processing functions (_process_response, etc.).",
  "flows": "Parameters are used to prepare request data and headers, which are sent via transport.request; responses are processed to determine success or handle errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SDK classes for managing various upload types with request retries and response validation. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. The request flows are typical for API clients, and response handling appears safe. No anomalies or suspicious network activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of Google API upload support classes. It exhibits no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks beyond typical SDK operations.",
