{
  "purpose": "Support for various types of Google API media uploads, including simple, multipart, resumable, and XML multipart uploads.",
  "sources": "Input data from function arguments (e.g., data, metadata, stream), HTTP responses from transport.request, request headers, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests via transport.request, request headers, and request URLs, potentially transmitting data over the network.",
  "flows": "Input data (data, metadata, stream) is used to prepare request payloads; these are sent via transport.request to specified URLs, with responses processed internally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or malicious functions. The code primarily wraps HTTP requests with retry logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for managing various upload workflows with network requests, including initiation, transmission, recovery, finalization, and cancellation. It uses standard request retry patterns, relies on external modules for actual HTTP requests, and processes responses internally. There are no signs of malicious payloads, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The functions handle typical upload tasks without executing or evaluating untrusted code, and no suspicious behaviors or anomalies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation for managing Google API media uploads. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It operates as a request wrapper with retry logic, focusing on safe network communication for uploading data.",
