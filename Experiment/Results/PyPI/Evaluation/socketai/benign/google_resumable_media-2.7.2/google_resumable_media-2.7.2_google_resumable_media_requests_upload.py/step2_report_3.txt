  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes classes for managing uploads (simple, multipart, resumable, XML MPU) with standard request handling, retries, and response processing.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious patterns, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and the logic aligns with standard SDK practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low).\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion that the code is safe and standard appears accurate. The low risk score is justified given the absence of suspicious activity. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the upload process, request handling, and response processing.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard request flows, and no suspicious network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code seems legitimate. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The minimal risk score aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on upload support, request flow, and response handling.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Standard request/response flow.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent; the code appears safe and legitimate. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes upload classes, request flows, and response processing.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. Standard network request handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code seems standard, with no suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, implementing upload workflows with retries and response handling.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code appears legitimate. The slightly higher risk score (0.2) still reflects a conservative approach but is justified given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation, but all low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the detailed analyses.\n- No modifications are necessary based on the provided information.\n- The code, as described, is a standard, well-implemented SDK component for uploads, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated activity.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n**Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, typical for SDK code with no known vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears safe, legitimate, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk scores are justified, and no further action is needed.",
