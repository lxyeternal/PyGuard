  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and determine appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes classes for managing uploads; sources are input parameters and request calls.\n- **Sinks:** HTTP requests via 'transport.request' and response processing.\n- **Flows:** Data flows logically from input parameters to request functions and response handlers.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis:** The code appears standard, with structured request handling, retries, and response processing. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe implementation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct, no malware)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, standard upload code)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, supporting upload workflows.\n- **Sinks:** Requests via 'transport.request' and response handlers.\n- **Flows:** Data passes through request preparation to transport calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Standard upload management code, with retry logic, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low, standard library)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Upload support classes with request flows.\n- **Sinks:** HTTP requests and response handlers.\n- **Flows:** Clear data flow from parameters to network requests.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Well-structured, standard API client code, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar upload management functions.\n- **Sinks:** HTTP requests, response processing.\n- **Flows:** Data flows from parameters into requests and responses.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or secrets.\n- **Analysis:** Standard, safe, request-retry pattern for API uploads.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Upload support classes, similar to others.\n- **Sinks:** Requests and response handling.\n- **Flows:** Data flows through request prep to network calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Standard, well-structured code for API uploads.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (acceptable)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are low, reflecting the standard nature of the code, with minor variations.\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- The code appears to be a standard, open-source client library for Google API uploads.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The request handling, retry logic, and response processing are typical and legitimate.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code are present.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, typical for such libraries)\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, legitimate, and free from malicious or suspicious activity.**",
