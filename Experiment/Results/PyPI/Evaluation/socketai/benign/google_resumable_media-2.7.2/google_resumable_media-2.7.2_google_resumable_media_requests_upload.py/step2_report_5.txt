  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Describes classes managing different upload types, with data flowing from parameters into request methods, then into HTTP requests, and response handlers.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. Uses standard libraries and straightforward retry logic.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears to be a standard, legitimate SDK component for Google API uploads. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low, considering network operations), confidence=0.9.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar structure, focusing on upload workflows, with data passing through request preparation, sending via transport, and response handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. Uses standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard upload support code. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Focuses on upload methods, with data flowing into request functions, then over network, responses processed.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies or suspicious activity. Standard implementation.\n- **Conclusion:** Clearly a legitimate SDK component, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar pattern, with request handling, retries, and response processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets. Standard API request handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe code for upload management.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** As above, upload workflows with request retries and response handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or secrets. Typical patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe SDK code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.95.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, no backdoors, no suspicious network behavior, and no obfuscated code. The malware score should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Clear, readable code with standard patterns. No obfuscation detected; score remains **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** The primary risk is related to network operations. Since the code is a client SDK for uploads, the risk is minimal, especially given the absence of secrets or malicious code. A conservative estimate would be around **0.1 to 0.2**. Given the current reports, I would set it at **0.1** for the overall risk.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: the code is a standard, open-source SDK component with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and minimal security risk in its current form.",
