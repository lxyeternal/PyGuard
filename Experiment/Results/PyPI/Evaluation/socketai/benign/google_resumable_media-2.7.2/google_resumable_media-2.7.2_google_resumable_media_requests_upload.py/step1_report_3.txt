{
  "purpose": "Support for various Google API upload methods including simple, multipart, resumable, and XML multipart uploads.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from parameters in transmit, initiate, transmit_next_chunk, recover, finalize, cancel, and upload methods; reading from transport.request calls; reading headers and URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "transport.request calls where untrusted data (method, url, headers, payload) are used; response processing methods (_process_response, _process_initiate_response, etc.) that handle server responses.",
  "flows": "Input data (data, metadata, stream) flows into request preparation methods, then into transport.request, and responses are processed via internal response handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic present. No suspicious URL manipulation or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements API upload workflows with structured request retry logic, response processing, and error handling. All data inputs are parameters or method calls. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or unauthorized data access. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or privacy violations detected. Usage of third-party libraries is standard for API requests and retries. Overall, this appears to be a legitimate implementation of Google API upload support, with proper structure and no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, legitimate implementation of Google API upload methods. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It safely handles data flow within expected parameters, with no hidden backdoors or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
