{
  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for handling HTTP requests, retries, and exceptions in media upload/download processes for Google services.",
  "sources": "Constants defining retry and sleep parameters, HTTP response status codes, exception classes, and the RetryStrategy class which manages retry logic.",
  "sinks": "The retry mechanism uses input parameters like sleep durations and retry counts; no direct data leaks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Code defines configuration and exception handling; no data flows or external input/output operations that could lead to security issues are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code is standard for handling HTTP retries and exceptions, with no hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility module for managing HTTP retries, exceptions, and constants related to media upload/download processes. It includes classes for custom exceptions and a retry strategy that controls retry logic based on configurable parameters. No external inputs, data leaks, or malicious patterns are present. All logic is straightforward, with proper use of constants and error handling. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility module for retry and error management in HTTP-based media operations. It contains no malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious activities. It appears to be safe and intentionally designed for robustness in request handling.",
