  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code content, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a utility module defining constants, exception classes, and a retry strategy class for handling HTTP requests, specifically in media upload/download contexts.\n- No external input data is processed directly; the code primarily defines configuration and error handling.\n- The code appears standard, well-structured, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious logic.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present.\n- The retry logic is straightforward, based on configurable parameters, with safeguards against conflicting settings.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is consistent, with no evident bugs or vulnerabilities.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent; the code is a benign utility module.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points and scoring considerations:\n\n#### 1. **Malware score:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0.\n- The code contains no malicious code, backdoors, or hidden payloads.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score should remain **0**.\n\n#### 2. **Obfuscated score:**\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- The code is straightforward and well-documented.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated score should remain **0**.\n\n#### 3. **Risk score:**\n- The code is a utility module, with no security risks, secrets, or vulnerabilities.\n- The only potential concern might be retry logic misconfiguration, but this is standard and configurable.\n- The reports assign a risk score of 0 or 0.1, which seems appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk score:**\n  - The code itself does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n  - Misuse or misconfiguration could lead to denial of service (via retries), but this is not a security breach.\n- **Conclusion:** The risk score should be **0** or very close to it, say **0.1** at most, but given the context, **0** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Score Type        | Suggested Value | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | **0**             | No malicious code or behavior detected.                     |\n| Obfuscated        | **0**             | Clear, straightforward code.                                |\n| Security Risk     | **0**             | No vulnerabilities or malicious activity.                   |\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are consistent in their assessments, all recognizing the code as benign.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code is a standard utility component used in HTTP request handling, with no signs of compromise.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is a safe, standard utility module for managing retries and HTTP response handling in media upload/download operations. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, and I agree with them.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0**  \n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a well-structured, non-malicious utility module with no security risks or obfuscation. The existing scores are appropriate, and I concur with the assessments provided.",
