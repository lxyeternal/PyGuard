  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Utility functions, constants, exception classes, and retry logic for HTTP requests in Google media operations.\n- **Findings:** No external input, no untrusted data processing, no suspicious patterns. Constants and classes are standard.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Both scores are 0.\n- **Assessment:** Completely benign, standard utility code. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar to Report 1—utilities for handling media uploads/downloads, including retry logic.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data, no anomalies, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Both scores are 0.\n- **Assessment:** Standard, safe utility code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Utility constants, exception classes, retry strategy for Google media operations.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Both scores are 0.\n- **Assessment:** Benign, standard utility code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar utility functions, constants, exception classes, retry logic.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — Slightly above zero, but likely due to the nature of retry logic which can be exploited if misused, but in this context, it appears standard.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent; the slight security risk score reflects the inherent nature of retry mechanisms, not malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Common utilities for media uploads/downloads, including exception handling and retry logic.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Both 0.\n- **Assessment:** Standard, benign utility code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** No. All reports describe utility modules with standard patterns.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently 0 across reports, indicating no malicious behavior.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with a minimal 0.1 in one report, likely due to the inherent risks in retry logic (which is standard in network code but can be exploited if misused). This is not evidence of malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The code is a well-structured, standard utility module for handling HTTP retries, exceptions, and constants in media upload/download operations.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- The minimal security risk score is appropriate given the context; retry logic can be a vector if misused, but nothing in the code indicates such misuse.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (confirmed benign)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (due to inherent retry logic, but not malicious)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
