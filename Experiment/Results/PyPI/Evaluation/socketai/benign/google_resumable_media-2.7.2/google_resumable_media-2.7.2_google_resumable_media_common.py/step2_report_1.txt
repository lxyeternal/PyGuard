  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It correctly notes that the code defines constants, exception classes, and a retry strategy, all standard for HTTP request handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Sound; no issues detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it finds no malicious behavior, just utility code for retries and exceptions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is characterized as standard utility code with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Sound.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher confidence (0.95) and a minimal security risk (0.1), but still no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable given the cautious note.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others, standard utility code with no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Final Step: Cross-Analysis & My Expert Estimation\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on zero, and the code is straightforward utility functions. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on zero; code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's benign nature, I agree with zero or near-zero scores. The only minor point is the securityRisk of 0.1 in one report, which is cautious but not indicative of actual risk.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for cautiousness, but overall very low)\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured utility module for HTTP retries and error handling.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is safe and benign.",
