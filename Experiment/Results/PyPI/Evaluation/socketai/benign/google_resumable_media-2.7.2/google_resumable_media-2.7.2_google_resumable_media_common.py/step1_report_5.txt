  "purpose": "Provide common utilities for Google Media Downloads and Resumable Uploads, including exceptions, constants, and retry logic.",
  "sources": "Imports from http.client; usage of constants for HTTP status codes; class constructors and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Exception handling and custom error classes; configuration attributes; retry logic conditions.",
  "flows": "Code reads HTTP response objects and status codes; handles errors; manages retry conditions based on sleep times and attempt counts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual logic observed. Use of constants and straightforward exception classes is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility constants for HTTP status codes and retry parameters, along with custom exception classes for handling HTTP response errors and data corruption. The RetryStrategy class manages retry logic with configurable parameters. All components are standard for HTTP request handling and retries, with no signs of malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The overall structure is typical for a utility library supporting media uploads/downloads. No anomalies indicating sabotage or malware are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for handling HTTP-based media transfer retries with robust error handling. There is no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It functions as a supportive helper for media upload/download operations without exposing security risks.",
