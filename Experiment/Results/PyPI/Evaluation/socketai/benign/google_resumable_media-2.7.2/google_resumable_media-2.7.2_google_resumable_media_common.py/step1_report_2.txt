{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and constants for handling media uploads/downloads, including retry logic, HTTP status codes, and custom exceptions.",
  "sources": "Imports 'http.client' to access HTTP status codes; no external data inputs observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; code primarily defines constants, classes, and exception handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code establishes configurations and exception classes without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed. All constants and class designs appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for HTTP status codes, retry parameters, and two custom exceptions for response and data corruption errors. The RetryStrategy class manages retry logic with configurable parameters and safeguards against conflicting settings. The code appears to be standard utility code for robust HTTP request handling without any signs of obfuscated, malicious, or maliciously intended code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for managing HTTP retries, status codes, and exceptions. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. Its purpose is to support media upload/download operations with configurable retry logic. No security risks are evident.",
