  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues detected; the code is standard utility code.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The confidence is high (1).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues; the code is a typical utility module.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical flaws or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code’s purpose is clear, standard, and benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues; standard retry and exception handling.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the security risk is very low, possibly due to the nature of retry logic, which by itself isn't risky.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity is detected; the slight security risk score is acceptable given the nature of retry logic.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues; standard utility functions.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The code is benign, and the low security risk score reflects the typical nature of such utility code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues; typical retry and exception classes.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports are 0, which aligns with the analysis — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1), reflecting the benign nature of retry logic and exception handling.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- The code is a typical utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- No changes needed.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very low, just acknowledging that retry logic can sometimes be misused, but in this case, it’s standard)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and does not pose security risks.",
