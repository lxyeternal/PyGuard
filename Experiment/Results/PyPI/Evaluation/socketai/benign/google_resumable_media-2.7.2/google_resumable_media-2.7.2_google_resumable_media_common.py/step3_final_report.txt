  "purpose": "Provides constants, exception classes, and a retry strategy class for handling HTTP requests in media upload/download operations.",
  "sources": "Constants and class definitions, including http.client status codes and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; primarily configuration and error handling.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters flow into the RetryStrategy class; exceptions are raised during error conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward utility code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard constants, exception classes, and a configurable retry strategy for HTTP requests. It does not process external input or contain any obfuscated or malicious code. The retry logic is typical and configurable, with safeguards against conflicting parameters. No hardcoded secrets or network activity are present. The code is well-structured, documented, and aligns with common patterns for network request handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for managing HTTP retries and error handling in media operations. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The minimal security risk score (0.1) assigned in one report is appropriate given the nature of retry mechanisms, but overall, the code is safe.",
