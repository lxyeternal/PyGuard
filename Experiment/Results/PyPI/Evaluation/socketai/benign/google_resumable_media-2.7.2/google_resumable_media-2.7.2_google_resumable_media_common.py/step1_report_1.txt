{
  "purpose": "Provides common utility functions, constants, exception classes, and retry logic for handling HTTP requests in Google media upload/download operations.",
  "sources": "Reads data from imported modules (http.client), internal constants, and class attributes; no external input data is explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations are present; the code mainly defines classes and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code establishes configuration and exception handling for HTTP request retries.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward, defining constants, exception classes, and a retry strategy without any obfuscated or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility constants related to HTTP status codes, retry configurations, and custom exception classes for handling HTTP response errors and data corruption. It also includes a RetryStrategy class for managing retry behavior based on total sleep time and retry counts. The implementation appears standard and intended for robust HTTP request handling without any signs of malicious behavior or malicious code insertion. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are detected. The code appears to be a well-structured utility module used in larger Google media processing tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It provides standard retry and exception handling for HTTP requests. The structure and content are typical for such utility functions, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
