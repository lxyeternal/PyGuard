  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is a benign utility module defining constants, exception classes, and a retry strategy for HTTP requests in media operations.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is straightforward and typical for such utility modules.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no security issues identified.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard utility functions, constants, and retry logic.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns or malicious intent; the code is standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility classes and constants for HTTP retries, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — very low, as the code is purely utility.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility code with exception classes, constants, and retry logic.\n- **Findings:** No malicious or suspicious patterns; standard implementation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very minimal, likely due to the nature of retry logic, which is common.\n- **Justification:** Retry mechanisms are inherently risky if misused, but here, they are standard and safe.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard utility functions for media uploads/downloads, with no malicious indicators.\n- **Findings:** No obfuscation, no backdoors, no suspicious data handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Very low, consistent with the code's purpose as a utility module.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0 — the code's functionality is safe, with only a minor note on retry logic (which is inherently low risk).\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, well-structured utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score assigned in report 4 is appropriate, given the nature of retry logic.\n\n**No further action needed.**",
