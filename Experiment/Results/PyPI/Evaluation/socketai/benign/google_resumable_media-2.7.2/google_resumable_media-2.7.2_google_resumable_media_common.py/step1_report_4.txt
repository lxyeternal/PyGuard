{
  "purpose": "Provides utility constants, exception classes, and a retry strategy class for managing HTTP request retries and handling specific response errors, primarily for Google Media download and upload operations.",
  "sources": "Imports 'http.client' and defines constants, exception classes, and a class for retry logic.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sink locations that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code sets up configurations and exception handling for HTTP requests but does not process or pass untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments are present. The constants and classes are standard for retry logic and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical utility module for managing HTTP request retries, error handling, and constants related to HTTP status codes. It includes exception classes with response object storage, configuration for retry limits, and a list of retryable HTTP status codes. The constants and class attributes follow standard practices without any malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of hidden backdoors, data theft, or malicious network activity. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, benign utility component used in larger Google Media operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for HTTP request management with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain suspicious code, backdoors, or malware indicators. The code is straightforward and aligns with common patterns for handling retries and errors in HTTP operations.",
