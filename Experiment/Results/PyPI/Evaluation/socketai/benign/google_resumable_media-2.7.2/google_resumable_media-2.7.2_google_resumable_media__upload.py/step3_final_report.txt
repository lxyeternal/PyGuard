{
  "purpose": "Provides base classes and utility functions for various media upload strategies to Google APIs, including stream handling, response validation, checksum verification, and multipart request construction.",
  "sources": "Stream reading functions, response headers, response bodies, JSON payloads, boundary generation, checksum objects.",
  "sinks": "Response status code checks, header parsing, checksum validation, stream seeking, response JSON processing.",
  "flows": "Input streams are read to produce payloads; response headers and bodies are parsed for validation; checksum objects are updated and verified; multipart bodies are constructed for upload requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets; no obfuscation; standard regex and secure random usage for boundary creation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard upload helper classes with well-structured methods for preparing requests, handling responses, and managing streams. Virtual methods indicate that actual network I/O is handled externally. Checksum validation and header parsing follow best practices. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code is consistent with SDK components designed for secure, reliable uploads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK component for media uploads, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It employs standard security practices and has a very low security risk profile.",
