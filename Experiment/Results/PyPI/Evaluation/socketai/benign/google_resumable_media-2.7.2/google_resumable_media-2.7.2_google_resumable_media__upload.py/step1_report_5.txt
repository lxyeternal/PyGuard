{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions for uploading media files to Google APIs, supporting simple, multipart, resumable, and XML multipart uploads, including handling of upload initiation, chunking, and finalization.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration and parameters from input arguments, stream objects, response headers, and response bodies; accesses environment variables indirectly via imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Makes HTTP requests through transport objects (though actual request methods are virtual and meant to be implemented elsewhere). Uses response headers and bodies to process upload progress and checksum validation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input streams (file or other IO) through reading functions, into request payloads and headers, then to HTTP requests; responses are processed to update upload status and verify integrity; checksum calculations occur during payload preparation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of regular expressions for byte range parsing is standard; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed. Some methods are placeholders raising NotImplementedError, indicating virtual methods intended for extension.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement standard upload logic with support for various upload types, handling streams, multipart boundaries, checksum verification, and HTTP response validation. No signs of malicious behavior, such as system info exfiltration, network data theft, reverse shells, or sabotage. The modules and functions focus solely on the upload process, and the network interactions are abstracted for implementation. Checksum functions and request preparations are standard security measures. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of upload helpers for Google APIs, with no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It is a standard component for media uploads with no security risks beyond typical upload handling. All functions and classes are consistent with expected upload workflows, and no malicious patterns are detected.",
