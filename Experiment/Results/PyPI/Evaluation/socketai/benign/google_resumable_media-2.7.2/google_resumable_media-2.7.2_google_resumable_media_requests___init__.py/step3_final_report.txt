{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility classes and functions for managing Google Cloud Storage media uploads and downloads, including resumable, simple, and multipart uploads, as well as download handling. It facilitates authenticated HTTP requests using the 'requests' library and 'google-auth' credentials.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from test mocks, response headers, and URL templates. It constructs request URLs and reads response headers such as 'Content-Length', 'Content-Range', and 'location'.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with HTTP response objects, request methods, and response headers. No untrusted data is directly written to files or executed; primarily constructs requests and processes responses.",
  "flows": "Input streams or mock responses serve as sources; data flows through request objects, response handling, and response headers to determine download/upload status and progress. No untrusted data reaches dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive test scaffolding with mock responses and request objects, which is standard for testing. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured utility module for Google Cloud Storage media operations, with clear documentation and test setups. It does not process untrusted data into dangerous sinks nor contains malicious or obfuscated code. The extensive test mocks are typical for open-source libraries and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility module for handling media uploads and downloads with Google Cloud Storage. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
