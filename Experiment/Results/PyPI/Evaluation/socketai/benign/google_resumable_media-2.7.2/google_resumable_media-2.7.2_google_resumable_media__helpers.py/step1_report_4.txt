  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling HTTP responses, checksums, headers, and retries in Google Cloud Storage resumable media operations.",
  "sources": "Reading response headers, response status codes, URL parsing, checksum digest bytes, environment variables (warnings), random number generator.",
  "sinks": "Checksum calculation, header validation, exception raising, URL modification, warnings for slow CRC32c implementation.",
  "flows": "Input data (response headers, URLs) flows into checksum validation, header checks, or URL query modifications; checksum objects are created from response headers; exceptions raised on invalid headers or status codes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random.randint for jitter in retries, warnings about slow crcmod, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for media response validation, checksum handling, and URL parameter management. It employs standard libraries and Google's API best practices. No suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity is evident. Use of warnings and logging is appropriate for debugging and performance notes. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic detected. The code's overall design aims at robust media transfer handling without security compromises.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured utility module for media response handling in Google Cloud Storage, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It includes some warnings about performance but no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
