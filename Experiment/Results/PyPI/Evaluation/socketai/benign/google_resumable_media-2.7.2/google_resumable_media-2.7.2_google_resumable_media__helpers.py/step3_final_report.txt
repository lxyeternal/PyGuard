  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling HTTP headers, checksum validation, URL manipulation, response validation, and retries in Google Cloud Storage media operations.",
  "sources": "Headers from HTTP responses, checksum bytes, URL query parameters, response objects.",
  "sinks": "Header validation, checksum computation, URL modifications, response status checks.",
  "flows": "Input data from response headers or URLs flows through validation and parsing functions, with no external data exfiltration or malicious network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Warnings about slow crcmod implementation are benign; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions used in cloud storage media handling, with proper error handling and validation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External checksum libraries are used with fallbacks, which could be supply chain risks but are not evidence of malicious tampering. The use of random jitter for retries is benign. Overall, the code is clear, well-structured, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign, standard utility functions for media handling in Google Cloud Storage. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage detected. The supply chain risk is minimal, and the assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
