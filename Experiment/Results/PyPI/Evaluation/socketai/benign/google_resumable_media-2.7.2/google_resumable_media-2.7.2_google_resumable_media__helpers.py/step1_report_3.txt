  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling HTTP responses, checksums, headers, and URL modifications in media download/upload processes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from HTTP response headers, URL parameters, and input arguments such as response objects, URLs, and checksum types.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include handling untrusted headers (like X-Goog-Hash), constructing URLs with user input, and checksum computations which could be misused if misconfigured.",
  "flows": "Data flows from HTTP response headers or URL parameters into checksum verification, header validation, and URL modifications; these can be manipulated if inputs are untrusted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code includes warnings about slow CRC implementations, which are benign. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard utility functions: header validation, checksum parsing, response status checks, URL query modifications, and checksum object creation. It uses safe libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious behavior. Warning about slow CRC implementation is benign and meant for performance optimization. No suspicious data exfiltration, network connections, or hidden backdoors are present. The code's logic appears consistent with normal operations for a media handling utility.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a set of standard helper functions for media response handling, checksum validation, and URL manipulation. It does not contain malicious or sabotage code. Its functions are safe, with no evident malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
