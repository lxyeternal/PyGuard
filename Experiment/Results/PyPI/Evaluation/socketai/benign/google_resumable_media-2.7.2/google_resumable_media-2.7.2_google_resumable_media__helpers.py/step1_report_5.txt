  "purpose": "Shared utility functions for handling HTTP headers, checksum calculations, URL modifications, and response validation in Google resumable media operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (base64, hashlib, random, warnings, urllib.parse), internal functions, and constants.",
  "sinks": "Header access functions, checksum calculation functions, URL modification functions, and response validation functions.",
  "flows": "Input data from HTTP response headers and URLs flows through checksum parsing, header validation, and URL query parameter modification functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `random.randint()` for jitter calculation introduces nondeterminism; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; functions appear standard for media transfer handling; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of utility functions for media transfer operations, including header validation, checksum processing, URL parameter handling, and response status checks. No parts of the code perform network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications. Use of `random.randint()` is benign and intended for jitter in retries. The code employs standard Python libraries and adheres to expected patterns for media handling and validation. No anomalies or malicious behavior indicators are present. The functions serve their intended purpose without executing untrusted code or sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of utility functions for managing media transfer responses, checksums, and URLs. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The use of randomness is for retry jitter and not suspicious. Overall, the code appears benign and suitable for production use with no supply chain security concerns.",
