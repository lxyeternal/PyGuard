  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward utility module, mainly importing constants and classes from an internal package (`google.resumable_media.common`) and exporting them via `__all__`.\n- No reports mention any dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or other behaviors that could be malicious.\n- The code is primarily documentation, licensing, and import/export statements—standard boilerplate for a Python package's `__init__.py`.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Are there any errors or flaws?**  \n  **No.** The reports correctly identify that the code is a standard package setup, with no suspicious or malicious elements.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, justified given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or below, since there's no evident security risk or malicious activity.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes. They are consistent with the code's content and the analysis.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- The reports assume that importing from `google.resumable_media.common` is safe. Given that this is an internal module, unless there's external tampering, this is a reasonable assumption.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis correctly states that the code is standard boilerplate.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code does not contain any dynamic or executable code beyond imports and exports.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The license headers and comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the provided code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always monitor for future updates or dynamic behaviors, but based on the current static code and reports, this package segment appears safe.",
