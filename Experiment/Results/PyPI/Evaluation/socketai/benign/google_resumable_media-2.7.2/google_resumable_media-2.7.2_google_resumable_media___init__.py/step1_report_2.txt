  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily documentation, licensing information, import statements, and module exports. It imports specific classes and constants from a common module without any dynamic or malicious behavior. No user input handling, no network calls, no code execution, or other suspicious activities are present. The structure is standard for a Python package's __init__.py file, and there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initialization file with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports and exports specific utilities and constants, accompanied by licensing and documentation comments.",
