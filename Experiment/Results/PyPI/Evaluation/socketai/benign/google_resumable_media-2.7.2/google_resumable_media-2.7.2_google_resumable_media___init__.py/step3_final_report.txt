  "purpose": "This module provides utility constants and classes for Google Media Downloads and Resumable Uploads, serving as an import hub for common components used in resumable media operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'google.resumable_media.common' such as DataCorruption, InvalidResponse, PERMANENT_REDIRECT, RetryStrategy, TOO_MANY_REQUESTS, UPLOAD_CHUNK_SIZE.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; purely static import/export statements.",
  "flows": "Import statements from internal module to local namespace, with no data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard boilerplate with licensing, documentation, and straightforward import/export structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package initialization file, importing constants and classes from an internal common module and exposing them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, user input handling, network activity, or obfuscated constructs. The licensing and documentation are standard. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for a Python package, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
