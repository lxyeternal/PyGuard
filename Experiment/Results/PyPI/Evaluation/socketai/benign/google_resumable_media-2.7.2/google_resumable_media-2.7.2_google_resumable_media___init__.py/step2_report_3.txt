  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward utility module, mainly consisting of licensing info, documentation, import statements, and an __all__ list.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is standard for a package's __init__.py or module setup, importing constants and classes from an internal common module.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n**Confirming the code's security posture:**\n- The code does not process untrusted input, does not perform any network operations, nor executes any dynamic code.\n- The imported classes and constants are from an internal module, likely part of the package, and there is no evidence they are malicious.\n- The licensing and documentation are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious activity or code injection detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is clear, well-documented, and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or lower. The code is benign, serving as a utility setup, with no evident security risks.\n\n**Any inconsistencies or questionable claims?**\n- All reports are consistent and agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is purely setup and import statements.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a minimal risk score, just to reflect that it's a utility setup, but practically negligible)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard utility module for a Python package, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate, and there is no need for concern based on this code snippet.",
