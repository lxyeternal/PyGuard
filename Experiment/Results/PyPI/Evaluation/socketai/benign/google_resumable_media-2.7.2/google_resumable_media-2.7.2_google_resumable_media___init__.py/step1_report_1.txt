{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and constants for handling Google Media Downloads and Resumable Uploads within the google-resumable-media package, mainly for internal use in managing upload/download processes.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.resumable_media.common module, which presumably contains shared constants and classes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external outputs; primarily imports and exports of constants and classes.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior are present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code includes licensing information, descriptive comments about package structure and installation instructions, and a straightforward import/export setup for constants and classes from a common module. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for a Python package, with no dangerous functions or data flows identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It mainly defines and exposes constants and classes related to Google media upload/download utilities.",
