  "purpose": "Shared utility classes and functions for handling HTTP requests and retries, specifically tailored for 'requests'-like transports in resumable media operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (`http.client`, `requests.exceptions`, `urllib3.exceptions`) and Google modules (`google.resumable_media.common`, `_helpers`). No external user input or data sources are directly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code primarily defines classes and functions for HTTP response handling and retry logic. No direct data leaks, system modification, or malicious sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A — The code does not process untrusted data through source-to-sink flows; it defines reusable components for HTTP operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The retry logic and response handling are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code contains utility classes (`RequestsMixin`, `RawRequestsMixin`) for extracting response data (status, headers, body) from HTTP responses, and a retry function that handles retriable errors with exponential backoff. It relies on external exceptions and common retry strategies but does not perform any network connections itself. There are no hardcoded secrets, hidden backdoors, or suspicious data flows. The retry function only deals with known connection errors and HTTP status codes, adhering to standard patterns. No obfuscated code or malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for HTTP request handling and retry logic with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as part of a larger system for resumable media uploads/downloads and appears trustworthy.",
