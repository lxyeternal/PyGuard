  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling HTTP responses and implementing retry logic in network communications.",
  "sources": "Response objects from HTTP requests, specifically response content, headers, and status code.",
  "sinks": "Response content and headers; no external data sinks or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Response data flows from response objects to utility functions that extract status, headers, and body; retry logic controls request retries based on response status.",
  "anomalies": "Use of private attribute '_content' in RawRequestsMixin could be unsafe but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard HTTP response handling and retry mechanisms. It includes functions to access response status, headers, and body, as well as a retry function that handles transient network errors. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The use of private attributes is noted but not malicious. The retry logic appropriately handles retriable errors with exponential backoff. Overall, the code appears to be benign utility code with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a legitimate, standard utility for HTTP response processing and retry management. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The minor concern about private attribute usage does not constitute malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
