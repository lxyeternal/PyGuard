  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes utility functions for HTTP responses and retries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identifies response data flow and retry logic.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard utility code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded; no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 (reasonable, minimal risk)  \n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; utility functions and retry handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous sinks; response data is handled normally.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified; no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes response handling and retries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious sinks; standard error handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well justified.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; utility functions for response and retries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Response content handling via private attributes (_content). This is potentially unsafe but not malicious.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of private attributes could be unsafe, but no malicious intent. No external connections or secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, just a note on potential unsafe practices.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, though the note on private attribute use is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; utility classes and functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard utility code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 (very low, standard utility code)\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as standard utility functions for HTTP response handling and retries.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The only minor concern is the use of private attributes (_content) in one report, which is more about unsafe practices than malicious intent.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Given the code's benign nature, I agree with a score of **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear and straightforward; I agree with **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** The overall security risk is minimal; I would assign **0.1 to 0.2**.\n\n### My estimated scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis code appears to be a legitimate, standard utility module with no malicious intent.",
