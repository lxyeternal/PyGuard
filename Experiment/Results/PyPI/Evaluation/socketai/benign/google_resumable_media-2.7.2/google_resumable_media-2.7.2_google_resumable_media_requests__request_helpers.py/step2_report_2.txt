  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes utility functions for HTTP responses and retries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data flow; response content is handled safely.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded, high confidence, no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is benign utility code.  \n**Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar utility functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct malicious sink; response handling is standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious intent; standard pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent.  \n**Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, standard utility functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious sinks; response content is accessed normally.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity; standard exception handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct; benign code.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate assessment.  \n**Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, standard utilities.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Response content access via private attributes (_content) could be unsafe but not malicious.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of private attributes is potentially unsafe but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Overall benign, with a note on unsafe practices but no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is not malicious but could be unsafe if misused.  \n**Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; no external data sources or malicious behaviors.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious sinks; standard utility functions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct; trustworthy utility code.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.  \n**Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. I agree with 0 across the board.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is evident; all reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the potential unsafe use of private attributes (_content). While not malicious, this could be considered a minor security concern if misused.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The **malware scores** are correctly assigned as 0.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are correctly assigned as 0.\n- The **security risk scores** could be marginally increased to reflect the unsafe use of private attributes, perhaps to 0.3, but given the benign nature, staying at 0.2 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.2-0.3 (minor concern due to private attribute usage, but not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and well-reasoned. The code is a standard, benign utility module with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
