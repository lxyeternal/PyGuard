{
  "purpose": "The code provides shared utility functions and classes for handling HTTP requests, responses, and retry logic in the context of Google resumable media operations, specifically tailored to requests-like transports.",
  "sources": "Reads include access to response objects' status codes, headers, and content via methods like _get_status_code, _get_headers, and _get_body. The wait_and_retry function reads and handles response objects during retries.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve response content access and the execution of user-defined functions within wait_and_retry, which could potentially lead to injection or unintended behavior if misused, but no direct dangerous sink is present in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from response objects via utility methods to facilitate response analysis, while wait_and_retry calls a user-provided function repeatedly, monitoring responses and errors to control retries.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets are evident. The code follows standard patterns for HTTP response handling and retries. There is proper separation of concerns, and no obfuscation or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for handling HTTP requests and retries, with no signs of malicious intent. It uses common exception handling and retry mechanisms aligned with typical network request practices. No suspicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code's structure and functions are consistent with legitimate, safety-oriented libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, legitimate utility module for handling HTTP responses and retries in the context of resumable media uploads/downloads. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and adheres to common patterns for network request handling.",
