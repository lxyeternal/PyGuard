  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is utility functions for HTTP response handling and retries, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which aligns with the benign analysis.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, indicating minimal concern.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, consistent with the clear code.\n- **Comments:** The analysis is sound; no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident. The code is standard and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard utility functions with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is solid; no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard utility functions for HTTP response handling and retries.\n- **Malware score:** 0, matching the benign description.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns; the code appears safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions with potential points of concern regarding private attribute access (`response._content`) and retry logic.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which is consistent with the lack of malicious intent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, reasonable given the potential unsafe use of private attributes but not malicious.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The mention of private attribute usage is noteworthy but not malicious. No backdoors or data exfiltration are present.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility classes and functions with no external data sources or malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1, reflecting low concern.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious signals.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, matching the clear code.\n- **Security risk scores:** Ranging from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low risk, which is appropriate given the code's utility nature and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The overall security posture of this code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk, primarily due to private attribute access and retry logic, but these are standard in such utility code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured utility module for HTTP request handling and retries, with no security concerns.",
