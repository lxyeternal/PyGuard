{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for handling HTTP requests, responses, and retries, specifically tailored to the 'requests' library, for use in resumable media operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from HTTP response objects, imports modules related to network communication, exceptions, and retries, and reads configuration constants such as timeout values.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data could be read from HTTP responses or exceptions, but there are no direct data leaks or system modification functions. The code handles network responses and errors.",
  "flows": "Data flows from HTTP response objects (response content, headers, status codes) through methods like _get_body, _get_headers, and _get_status_code. These are used in the wait_and_retry function to determine whether to retry based on response status or errors.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard utility code for managing HTTP requests and retries. There are no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No obfuscation or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for handling HTTP responses and exceptions, with methods to extract status codes, headers, and response bodies. It also implements a retry mechanism that retries network requests based on error types and response status codes, with exponential backoff. The use of standard library modules, clear exception handling, and absence of suspicious activity suggest this is a benign utility module. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network connections, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for HTTP request handling and retry logic, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger library for resumable media operations. Overall security risk is minimal.",
