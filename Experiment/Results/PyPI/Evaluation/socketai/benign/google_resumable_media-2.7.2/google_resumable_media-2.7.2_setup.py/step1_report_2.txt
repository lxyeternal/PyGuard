{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'google-resumable-media', designed to facilitate package installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README file for long description. It also defines dependencies in REQUIREMENTS and EXTRAS_REQUIRE. The setup function gathers package data and configuration.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; the script primarily handles package configuration and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reads README from filesystem -> configures package metadata -> installs dependencies -> runs setup",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are present. The code strictly performs package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules (os, setuptools), reads a README file, defines dependencies, and invokes setuptools.setup() with package metadata and configuration. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources is evident. The dependencies are version-restricted but legitimate. The code structure is typical for Python packaging scripts. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It properly handles package configuration and dependencies without any suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
