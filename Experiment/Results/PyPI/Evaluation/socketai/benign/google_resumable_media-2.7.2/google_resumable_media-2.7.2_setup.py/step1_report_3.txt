  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file for long description; importing os and setuptools modules; reading requirements from a list; calling setuptools.setup() with package configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sink points for untrusted data or inputs. The code primarily performs package setup tasks.",
  "flows": "Reading README content -> passing configuration parameters to setuptools.setup() -> package installation and distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures; no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code. Use of standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup script for packaging a project. It reads a README file, defines requirements, and calls setuptools.setup() with various metadata. There are no external input points, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns detected.
