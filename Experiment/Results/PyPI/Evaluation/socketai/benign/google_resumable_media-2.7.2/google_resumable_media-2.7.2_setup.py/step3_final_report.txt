  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'google-resumable-media', configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README file; static dependency lists; static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools, reading a local README, defining fixed dependencies, and calling setup() with static parameters. No dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk, consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign Python package configuration script with no malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
