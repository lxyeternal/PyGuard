  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'google-resumable-media' Python package, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file, static import statements, and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; setup configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python project. It reads a README file for the long description, defines dependencies, and calls setuptools.setup() with project metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or user input handling. The dependencies are version-restricted but benign, and the script excludes test and documentation packages from distribution. No suspicious or malicious code features are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical Python package setup file with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. It performs standard package configuration tasks safely.",
