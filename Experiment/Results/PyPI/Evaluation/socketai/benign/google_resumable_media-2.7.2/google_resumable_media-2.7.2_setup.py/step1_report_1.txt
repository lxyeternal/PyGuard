{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'google-resumable-media' Python package, including dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long description, importing 'os' and 'setuptools' modules, and defining requirements lists.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external data usage beyond standard setup procedures.",
  "flows": "Reading local files for package description; defining static requirements; calling setuptools.setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. Uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard package setup: reads a README file, defines dependencies, and calls setuptools.setup(). There is no code execution based on untrusted input, no network communication, and no suspicious behavior. The dependencies are static and version-locked, and the metadata is straightforward. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution with specified dependencies and metadata.",
