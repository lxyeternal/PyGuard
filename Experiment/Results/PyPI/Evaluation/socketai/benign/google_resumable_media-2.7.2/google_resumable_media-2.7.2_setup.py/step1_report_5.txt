{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'google-resumable-media', including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long description, importing os and setuptools modules, and defining requirements.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or transmits data, or interacts with untrusted sources at runtime.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows identified; static setup script reads a local README file and defines package dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs observed. Usage of standard setup pattern.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup procedures: reading a README file, defining requirements, and calling setuptools.setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no network connections, no credential handling, and no suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward, primarily for package configuration. The reading of a local file ('README.rst') is standard and safe. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely configures package metadata and dependencies.",
