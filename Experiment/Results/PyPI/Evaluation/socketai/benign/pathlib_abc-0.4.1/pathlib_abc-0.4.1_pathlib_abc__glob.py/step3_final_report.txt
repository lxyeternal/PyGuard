  "purpose": "Filesystem globbing utility implementing pattern matching, recursive traversal, and hidden file handling.",
  "sources": "Pattern parameters, filesystem APIs (os.scandir, os.stat, os.path functions)",
  "sinks": "Regex compilation, filesystem access functions, pattern matching logic",
  "flows": "Pattern inputs flow into regex translation and filesystem API calls; pattern matching results influence filesystem traversal",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, standard implementation of globbing functions with pattern translation, recursive directory traversal, and hidden file handling. It uses standard modules and practices, with security auditing via sys.audit. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious data flows are present. The pattern translation and filesystem access are typical for such utilities and do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure globbing utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and can be considered safe.",
