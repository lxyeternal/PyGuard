{
  "purpose": "The code provides low-level OS functionality wrappers used by pathlib, including file copying, opening, and path status checks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include file paths for open(), os.stat(), os.lstat(), os.path.exists(), and os.path.isdir(); also os.DirEntry objects.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to files via target file objects in copyfileobj(); system calls like fcntl.ioctl, posix._fcopyfile, os.copy_file_range, os.sendfile, and _winapi.CopyFile2 are used for copying data between files.",
  "flows": "File paths or file-like objects act as sources; data flows through system calls or read/write loops to targets; specific system calls (ioctl, _fcopyfile, copy_file_range, sendfile, CopyFile2) are used as high-performance copy sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual obfuscated code. Use of platform-specific system calls is expected. Exception handling is standard. No suspicious behavior like data exfiltration or network activity is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily wraps native system calls and OS functions for file copying, opening, and path status. It handles platform-specific differences (Windows vs POSIX). The functions use standard OS features, such as copy-on-write (fcntl.FICLONE), macOS's _fcopyfile, Linux's copy_file_range, sendfile, and Windows CopyFile2. The code includes exception handling for expected system errors and attempts fallback methods when high-performance options fail. No indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection, are present. The functions seem to serve legitimate system-level file management tasks with no hidden or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of OS file operations with platform-specific optimizations. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage signals. All observed behaviors are consistent with legitimate system utilities. No malware or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
