  "purpose": "Provides filename pattern matching using shell wildcards, translating patterns into regex for matching.",
  "sources": "Pattern input (PATTERN), filename input (name), environment normalization (os.path.normcase), pattern translation (translate), regex compilation (_compile_pattern).",
  "sinks": "Regex matching (re.compile(res).match), pattern translation cache, pattern matching results.",
  "flows": "Pattern input -> translate() -> regex compilation -> match() -> match result.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation or suspicious code; potential for regex-based ReDoS if patterns are maliciously crafted, but no malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard filename pattern matching by translating shell patterns into regex, caching compiled regex for efficiency. It normalizes case based on OS, supports wildcards, character classes, and negations. No malicious code, backdoors, or external data leaks are present. The main security concern is potential ReDoS via complex patterns, which is acknowledged but not actively exploited. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and risk is around 0.2 due to pattern complexity potential. The implementation is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign filename matching utility with no malicious behavior. The primary security risk is the potential for regex ReDoS if patterns are maliciously crafted, but no active malicious code or obfuscation exists. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
