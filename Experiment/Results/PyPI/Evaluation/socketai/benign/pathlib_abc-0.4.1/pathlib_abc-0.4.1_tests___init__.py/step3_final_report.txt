  "purpose": "Load test modules from the directory of the current file using the test support utility.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), load_package_tests",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication",
  "flows": "load_tests calls load_package_tests with the directory path derived from __file__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward use of standard library functions without obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a test utility, then defines a function to load tests from its own directory. It does not handle user input, network data, or perform any malicious actions. The pattern is typical for Python test setups, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with its benign nature. No vulnerabilities or anomalies are present, and the code's simplicity reduces false positives.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe test loader with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
