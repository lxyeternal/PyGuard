  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward test loader, using standard library functions.\n- There are no signs of data leaks, external communication, or malicious behavior.\n- The code only reads its own directory and passes it to a test utility.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code is present as provided.\n- The logic is simple and correct.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The code is a typical pattern used in Python testing frameworks.\n- The use of `__file__` and `load_package_tests` is standard.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware score: 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is appropriate; code is clear.\n- Risk score: 0 is appropriate; no security risk.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed in the scoring or conclusions.\n- The code is safe, benign, and standard.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard test loader with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are thorough and accurate. No further action is necessary.",
