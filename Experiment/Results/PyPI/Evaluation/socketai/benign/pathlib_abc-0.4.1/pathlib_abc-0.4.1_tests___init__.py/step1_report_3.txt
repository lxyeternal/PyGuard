{
  "purpose": "The code loads test cases from a package directory, likely for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), load_package_tests",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or insecure operations",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted source to sink",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code, uses standard libraries and functions",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' and a specific testing support function. It defines 'load_tests' which calls 'load_package_tests' with the directory of the current file. This is typical for setting up test suites. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or suspicious code constructs. The code appears to be benign and intended for testing purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test loader function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
