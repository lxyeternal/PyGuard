  "sinks": "No untrusted input, data leaks, or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code consists solely of static assignments and list definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets other than metadata, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static configuration variables for a documentation build process. It only sets project metadata, extensions, exclude patterns, and theme, with no external inputs, dynamic execution, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely configuration for a documentation system and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
