  "purpose": "Configuration settings for a Python documentation project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of project name, copyright, author, extensions, exclude_patterns, and html_theme variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no data leaks or external communications involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to critical sinks; all values are statically assigned within the code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements; all code is straightforward configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration script with hardcoded project metadata and setup parameters. No dynamic execution, user input, or external data handling is observed. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code is purely static configuration, which is common in documentation setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign Sphinx configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. It only sets up project metadata and appearance settings for documentation generation.",
