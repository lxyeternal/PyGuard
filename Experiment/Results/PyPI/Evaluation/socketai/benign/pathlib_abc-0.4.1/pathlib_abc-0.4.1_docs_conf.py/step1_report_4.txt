  "purpose": "Configuration settings for a documentation project, specifying project name, author, extensions, and themes.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements for variables such as project, copyright, author, extensions, exclude_patterns, html_theme.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no direct data outputs, network calls, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. All variables are straightforward and typical for configuration files.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple set of configuration variables for a documentation generator (likely Sphinx). There are no external inputs, data manipulations, or dynamic code executions. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard setup for project documentation with no security concerns.",
