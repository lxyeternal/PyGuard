  "purpose": "Import various stream and collection utility functions and classes from a local module named 'streams'.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module in the same package ('streams').",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing logic; only imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns detected; code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import of multiple functions and classes from a local module named 'streams'. There are no data processing, input handling, or security-sensitive operations visible. The imports seem to relate to stream handling and collection utilities, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Since the code is only importing and not executing any suspicious logic, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a benign import statement for various utilities within a package. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based solely on this snippet.",
