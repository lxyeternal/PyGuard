{
  "purpose": "The code imports various stream-related functions and classes from a local module named 'streams'. Its primary purpose appears to be setting up or utilizing stream data structures and utilities for processing data streams.",
  "sources": "Local module 'streams' as the source of imported functions and classes",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows or untrusted data inputs identified in this fragment",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains import statements with no suspicious or unusual constructs; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple functions and classes related to stream processing from a local module. There are no input reading, data handling, or potentially unsafe operations present. Since it only involves import statements, there are no sources or sinks to analyze for malicious flows. The module 'streams' might contain more complex logic, but based solely on this snippet, nothing suspicious is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to be a benign import statement setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical module import pattern with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
