  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential discrepancies.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple import statement from a local 'streams' module.\n- No data processing, input/output, or external interactions are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.\n- The scores assigned are predominantly low, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and security risk scores at 0.1 or 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n1. **Code presence of issues:**  \n   The code is just an import statement, which is benign. No issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic:**  \n   None are evident. The report correctly identifies the code as a straightforward import.\n\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - Malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with benign code.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, which aligns with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - Security risk scores are low (0.1 or 0), which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n   - Confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1.0), appropriate for such straightforward code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1, which is appropriate. The code is non-executing, import-only, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware score reflection:**  \n   Correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious behavior; they recognize the code's benign nature.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code snippet and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Critical Points:\n- Since the code is purely an import statement, the potential for malicious activity is extremely low unless the 'streams' module itself is malicious. However, without its content, we cannot evaluate further.\n- The reports correctly refrain from overestimating risk or malware scores based solely on this import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, should stay very low, around 0.1 or less.\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.**\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.05 to 0.1 (minimal risk, just an import statement)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately. No changes are necessary.",
