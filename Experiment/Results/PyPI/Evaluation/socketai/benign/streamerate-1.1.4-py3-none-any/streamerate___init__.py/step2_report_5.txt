  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a simple import statement from a local module `streams`.\n- No data processing, input/output, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or anomalies are identified.\n- The code appears benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a straightforward import with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 — minimal, considering it's just an import.\n  - Confidence: 0.9 — high confidence.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, consistent and correct.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n  - Confidence: 0.9 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states the code is benign.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 — no risk.\n  - Confidence: 1.0 — very high confidence.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly notes the code as a benign import.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 — acceptable.\n  - Confidence: 0.9 — high confidence.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states the code is just an import, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n  - Confidence: 1 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, all reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None detected; all reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores review:**\n  - Malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n  - Security risk scores are low (0.1), reflecting minimal concern.\n  - Confidence levels are high, consistent with the simplicity of the code.\n- **Potential improvements:** No changes needed; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional considerations:**\n\n- Since the code is only an import statement, **malware risk is effectively zero**.\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious behavior.\n- The `malware` score should remain at 0.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, which is appropriate.\n- The `securityRisk` could be kept at 0 or 0.1; given the code's benign nature, 0 is also acceptable, but 0.1 is reasonable to account for the fact that any import could, in theory, introduce risk if the module is malicious (though unlikely here).\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (confirmed benign)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 or 0.1 (both acceptable; given the reports, 0.1 is fine)\n\n**In conclusion,** all reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security issues. The provided reports are thorough and correct, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.",
