  "purpose": "Import various classes and functions related to stream processing and data structures from the local module 'streams'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module 'streams' via relative import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations are present; this is solely an import statement.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward import statement; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import from the 'streams' module, importing various classes and functions. It does not execute any logic, handle inputs, or perform data processing. The imported names suggest they are for stream and data structure management. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues in this snippet. Since it is just an import statement, the likelihood of malicious activity is extremely low.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply brings in functions and classes for use elsewhere in the codebase.",
