  "sinks": "None.",
  "flows": "None; import statement does not process data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a local module, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 or 0.1) are consistent with the code's nature. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforwardness of the import statement. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No modifications are necessary.",
