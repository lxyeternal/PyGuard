  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe straightforward import statements from a local 'streams' module.\n- No data processing, input/output, or network interactions are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors are identified.\n- All reports assign very low security risk and malware scores (mostly 0), which aligns with the benign nature of import statements.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1.0), indicating that the assessments are well-founded.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's security posture:\n\n**Does the code contain malicious behavior?**  \nNo. Import statements alone do not execute code or handle data, so they cannot be malicious by themselves.\n\n**Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \nNo. The code is syntactically correct and typical for Python modules.\n\n**Are the scores appropriate?**  \nYes. Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, reflecting no malicious activity. Security risk scores are very low (0.1 or 0), which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points and reasoning:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \nAll reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \nAll are 0, which makes sense as the code is straightforward import statements.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \nGiven the lack of any suspicious behavior, the risk scores are appropriately low.\n\n- **Potential assumptions:**  \nSome reports mention \"the module 'streams'\" but do not assume malicious content within it. Since only the import statement is visible, and no further context is provided, there is no basis to suspect malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \nScores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code.\n\n- **Additional considerations:**  \nIf the 'streams' module is malicious or compromised, the risk could be higher. But based solely on this snippet, the import statement itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated security risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but given the cautious approach, 0.1 is acceptable)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code fragment is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI agree with the current assessments. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
