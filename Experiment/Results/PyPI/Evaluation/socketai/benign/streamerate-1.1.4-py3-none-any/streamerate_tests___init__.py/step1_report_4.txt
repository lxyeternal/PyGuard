{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define author metadata, specifically an email address, possibly as part of a larger module or script.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from the hardcoded string '__author__' which contains an email address.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where data flows to or from untrusted sources; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present; the code only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable element is the email address stored as a string, which is common metadata and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, setting an author attribute to an email string. There are no input handling, data processing, or network communication. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present. The code is typical for metadata annotation and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only author metadata with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
