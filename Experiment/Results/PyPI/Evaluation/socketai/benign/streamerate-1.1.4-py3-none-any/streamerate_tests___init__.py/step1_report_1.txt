  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a single metadata assignment with an email address; no unusual or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "This code snippet assigns an email address to the __author__ variable, which is a common practice for Python modules to specify authorship. There are no inputs, outputs, or operations that could be exploited. The email is a standard contact detail. No malware behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple author metadata assignment with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
