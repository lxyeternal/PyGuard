  "purpose": "The code appears to set the author metadata for a Python module, indicating the author's email address.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points; no untrusted data handling or external interactions observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with only author metadata; no suspicious or unusual code constructs, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines the __author__ variable with an email address. It lacks executable logic, external data handling, or network operations. No anomalies, malicious patterns, or security risks are evident in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only as metadata annotation with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
