  "purpose": "Unit testing for the 'stream' function from the 'streamerate' module to verify list conversion.",
  "sources": "Input data: range(1, 4) fed into stream().toList()",
  "sinks": "Assertion check with assertListEqual (not a data sink, but relevant for testing correctness)",
  "flows": "Input range -> stream() -> toList() -> comparison with expected list",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing framework and the 'stream' function, then defines a test case that converts a range to a list via 'stream'. The test asserts the output matches an expected list. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or abnormal data handling. The usage appears straightforward, aiming to test functional correctness.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard unit test for a streaming operation without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It is safe and normal in context.",
