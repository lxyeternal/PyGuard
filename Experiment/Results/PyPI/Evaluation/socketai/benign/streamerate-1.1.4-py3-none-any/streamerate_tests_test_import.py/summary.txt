  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is overly cautious; the appropriate score is 0, given the evidence. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly 0. The slight risk score in report 5 can be justified as cautious but should be set to 0 for accuracy."
