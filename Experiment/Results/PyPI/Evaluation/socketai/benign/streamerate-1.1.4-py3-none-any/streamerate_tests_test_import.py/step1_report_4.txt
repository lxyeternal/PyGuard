  "purpose": "Unit testing code for the 'stream' module, verifying range conversion to list.",
  "sources": "Input source is the range object passed to stream(range(1, 4)).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the range object through the stream function to the toList() method, then compared to a predefined list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing framework and a stream module. It defines a unit test that converts a range into a stream and then into a list, comparing it to an expected list. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage. No external network activity, no use of environment variables, and no risky code patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple unit test for a stream conversion utility, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
