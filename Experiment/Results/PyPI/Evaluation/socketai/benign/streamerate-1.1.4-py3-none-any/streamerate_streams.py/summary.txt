  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, sophisticated utility library with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The risk score reflects the inherent danger of pickle serialization but is appropriate given the context. Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent; no adjustments are necessary."
