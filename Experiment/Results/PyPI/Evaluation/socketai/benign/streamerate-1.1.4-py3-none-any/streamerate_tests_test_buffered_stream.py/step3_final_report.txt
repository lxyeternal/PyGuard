  "purpose": "Unit tests for stream processing classes/functions in streamerate.streams, verifying in-memory data handling and flow correctness.",
  "sources": "Internal data generators (range, list comprehensions) used within test cases.",
  "sinks": "Assertions on in-memory data; no external data sinks or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal generators through stream classes to assertions; no external or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external dependencies executing untrusted code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests for classes imported from streamerate.streams, operating entirely on internally generated data with no external inputs, outputs, or network activity. The tests verify data transformations and buffer behaviors, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward, using standard unittest practices, and does not perform any dangerous operations. The absence of external data handling or dynamic code execution further indicates benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of unit tests for stream classes, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues detected. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to its testing nature. The provided reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
