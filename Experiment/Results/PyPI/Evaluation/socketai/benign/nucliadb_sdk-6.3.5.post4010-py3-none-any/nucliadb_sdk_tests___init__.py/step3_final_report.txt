  "purpose": "The code contains only licensing comments with no executable or suspicious content, serving to inform users of licensing terms.",
  "sources": "The comments themselves are the only source of data; no input or external data is read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to vulnerabilities or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist, as the code is purely comments with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present; the code is straightforward licensing boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of licensing comments, with no executable code, data processing, or input/output operations. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero. The assessments are consistent and accurate, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely licensing boilerplate with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the current scoring is appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
