  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing setup for NucliaDB, with no malicious intent or activity. The security concerns are limited to hardcoded credentials and static environment variables, which are acceptable in a controlled test environment. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical test environment practices. No modifications are necessary."
