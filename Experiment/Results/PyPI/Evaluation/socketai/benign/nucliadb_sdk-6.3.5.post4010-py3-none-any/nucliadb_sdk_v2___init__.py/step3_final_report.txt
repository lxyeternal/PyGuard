{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or export point, exposing specific classes from the local SDK for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports classes from a local module (.sdk).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains only licensing comments, import statements, and an __all__ declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module, primarily consisting of license headers, a single import statement, and an __all__ declaration. It does not process data, execute commands, or perform any dynamic behavior. No signs of obfuscation, embedded secrets, or malicious activity are present. The code's simplicity and static nature make it benign. All reports correctly identify this as a standard, safe module setup with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
