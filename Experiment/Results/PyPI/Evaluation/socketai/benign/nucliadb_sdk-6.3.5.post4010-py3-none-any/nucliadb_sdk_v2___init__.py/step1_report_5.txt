  "purpose": "This code appears to set up and export components of a Python SDK related to NucliaDB, including classes NucliaDB, NucliaDBAsync, and Region.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules from a local package (.sdk) and references publicly available license information comments.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import classes from a local module and define __all__ for module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code contains standard import/export structure with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that imports specific classes from a local SDK module and exposes them via __all__. The licensing comments are standard and do not contain embedded code or secrets. There are no indications of code that reads untrusted input, writes to files, or interacts with network sources. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with licensing comments and class exports. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security risks detected.",
