{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an __init__.py file for a Python package, importing specific classes from a local sdk module and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it primarily imports modules and defines export variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is standard for a package __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from a local module (.sdk) and declares the public API via __all__. It contains licensing comments but no executable or malicious logic. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity. The structure is typical for a Python package initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply exposes certain classes for external use.",
