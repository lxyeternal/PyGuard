{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that exports certain classes or functions related to 'NucliaDB' and 'Region' from an SDK, likely used for database interactions or service configuration.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules from a local package '.sdk' and defines the __all__ attribute for export.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted input or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements, a license header, and an export list. There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python module defining exported symbols. It begins with a license header, which is common in open-source projects, and then imports specific classes or functions from a local SDK module. The __all__ list indicates which names are exported when the module is imported elsewhere. There are no data inputs, no processing logic, no external connections, and no indications of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple module export with a license header. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. The code is straightforward and typical of open-source Python packages.",
