{
  "purpose": "This code defines the module's public API by specifying the classes and objects to be exported.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module (.sdk), specifically NucliaDB, NucliaDBAsync, and Region.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. The comments are licensing notices only.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of licensing comments and a straightforward import statement from a local module. It defines __all__ for export control. No code execution, data input, or external communication is present. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module file, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a module initialization file that declares exports. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security issues.",
