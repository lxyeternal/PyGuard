{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python SDK for interacting with the NucliaDB API, including synchronous and asynchronous clients, request preparation, response parsing, and endpoint configurations.",
  "sources": "Reading user input via method parameters, environment variables for configuration, and headers for authentication.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request sending methods that transmit data over the network, including payloads and headers.",
  "flows": "User-provided data flows into request payloads and headers, which are sent over the network to the NucliaDB API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; endpoint paths are standard; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code properly validates request types and handles responses securely.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured SDK for API interactions, implementing request building, response parsing, and error handling. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration is observed. Use of environment variables for configuration and explicit request handling reduces risk. The request functions are standard, with proper validation and error management. No suspicious network activity, credential leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured API SDK without malicious intent or security risks. It follows best practices for request handling, response validation, and configuration management. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
