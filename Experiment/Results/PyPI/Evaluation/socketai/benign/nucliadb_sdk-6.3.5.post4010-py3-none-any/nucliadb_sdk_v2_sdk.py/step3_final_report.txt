{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Python SDK for interacting with NucliaDB's API, providing methods for resource management, search, configuration, and other API endpoints.",
  "sources": "Network request functions, request builders, response parsers, and configuration parameters such as region, URL, headers, and API key.",
  "sinks": "HTTP network calls to NucliaDB endpoints; no data exfiltration or untrusted data execution observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method calls into network requests, with responses parsed and returned as structured objects; no suspicious data manipulation detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious dynamic code; standard error handling and request validation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured SDK with clear request/response handling, standard error management, and no signs of malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the absence of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage. The malware score is consistently 0, and the security risk scores are very low (~0.1), justified by the network interactions inherent to SDKs but with no malicious activity. No vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe SDK for API interaction, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The analysis and scores are consistent and justified.",
