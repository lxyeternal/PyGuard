{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up and expose classes and modules related to the nucliadb SDK, likely for database interactions or similar functionality.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes and exceptions from the nucliadb_sdk.v2 package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as data output, network communication, or file writing. No untrusted data handling or external communication is visible.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exposes certain modules and classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behavior are present. The code is straightforward and purely declarative with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The script contains only licensing comments and imports of specific classes and exceptions from a package, then defines __all__ for exports. No data input, network activity, or complex logic is present. The code is standard for a module setup, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks. It serves to expose certain components of the nucliadb SDK for use elsewhere.",
