  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code consists solely of licensing comments and an import statement that re-exports specific classes and exceptions from the `nucliadb_sdk.v2` package.\n   - The `__all__` variable explicitly defines the public API for this module.\n   - There are no dynamic code executions, data processing, network communications, or handling of untrusted data.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Risks and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - Given the simplicity and static nature of the code, there are no signs of malicious intent.\n   - The code functions as a module to expose SDK components, which is a common pattern.\n   - The licensing comments are standard and do not impact security.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct since there is no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and only re-exports symbols.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The reports are consistent and correctly identify that the code is benign.\n   - No adjustments are necessary for the scores.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty, which is justified.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is purely structural and serves as an API surface, it cannot be malicious unless the imported SDK itself is compromised, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate.\n- The analysis is consistent and accurate.\n- No further action or adjustment needed.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward, benign module that re-exports SDK components.\n- It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The current scores and analysis are justified and should remain as is.\n\n**Overall Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe and free from malicious intent.",
