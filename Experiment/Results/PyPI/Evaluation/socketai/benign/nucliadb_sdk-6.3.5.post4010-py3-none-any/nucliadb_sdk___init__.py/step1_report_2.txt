  "purpose": "Define public API exports and include licensing information for the nucliadb SDK module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from nucliadb_sdk.v2, licensing comments at the beginning",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as there are only import statements and comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard license comments and straightforward imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of licensing comments and an import statement importing classes and exceptions from a third-party SDK module. The license comments are standard and do not contain executable code. The import statement is direct and does not involve dynamic execution, user input, or data processing. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module definition with licensing information and a simple import statement. There is no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks identified in this snippet.",
