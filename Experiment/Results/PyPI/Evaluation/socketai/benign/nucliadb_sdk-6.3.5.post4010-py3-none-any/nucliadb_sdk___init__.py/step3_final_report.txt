{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that re-exports specific classes and exceptions from the nucliadb_sdk.v2 package, providing a simplified public API surface.",
  "sources": "The import statement from nucliadb_sdk.v2 and the licensing comments; no dynamic input or external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code imports SDK components and exposes them via __all__, with no data flow beyond module import/export.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is static and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module that re-exports SDK classes and exceptions, with licensing comments. It contains no dynamic behavior, no user input handling, network activity, or data processing. The code's purpose is purely structural, serving as an API interface. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The import from a trusted SDK and the absence of external data flows further support its benign nature. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate. The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are justified; no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
