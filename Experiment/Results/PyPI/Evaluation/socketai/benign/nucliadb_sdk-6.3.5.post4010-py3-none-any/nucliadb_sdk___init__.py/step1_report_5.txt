  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no user input, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific classes and exceptions from an SDK package and defines __all__ for exports. It contains licensing comments but no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of malware, obfuscated code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign module solely for defining exports. No malicious behavior or security concerns are evident.",
