  "purpose": "Define and expose public API components for nucliadb SDK, including classes and exceptions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from nucliadb_sdk.v2, and the __all__ declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code primarily imports modules and declares exports without processing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module initializer that imports specific classes and constants from an SDK package and exposes them for public use. It contains no dynamic execution, user input handling, or external data operations. It is well-documented with licensing comments and appears to be a typical, benign package interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module initialization file without malicious behavior. It serves to export SDK components for external use. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
