  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code in detail.\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for client-related errors.\n   - All classes inherit from `ClientError`, which itself inherits from `Exception`.\n   - The only class with additional logic is `RateLimitError`, which has an `__init__` method accepting an optional `try_after` parameter, likely used to suggest when to retry after rate limiting.\n   - The code contains no external data reading, no data processing, no network operations, and no dynamic code execution.\n   - There are no obfuscated elements, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, straightforward, and contains no malicious intent.\n   - The inclusion of a `try_after` parameter in `RateLimitError` is typical for rate limiting scenarios and does not indicate malicious activity.\n   - No evidence of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious code is present.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear class definitions.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, justified by the lack of any security risk or suspicious behavior.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Inconsistencies:**\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable. They correctly identify the code as standard exception class definitions.\n   - The only minor note is the optional `try_after` parameter in `RateLimitError`, which is standard practice and not suspicious.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is benign, well-structured, and typical for error handling in Python.\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and justified.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a clean, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The provided scores are accurate and should remain as is.",
