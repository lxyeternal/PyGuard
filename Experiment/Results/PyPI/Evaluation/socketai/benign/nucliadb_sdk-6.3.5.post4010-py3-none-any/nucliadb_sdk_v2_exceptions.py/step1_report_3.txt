{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various client-side errors in a Python application.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data sources directly.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external sources or causes side effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no input/output flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class definitions with no unusual language features, obfuscation, or hidden behavior. The only notable point is the __init__ method in RateLimitError which includes an optional parameter, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. The RateLimitError class has an optional 'try_after' parameter, which is typical for rate limiting scenarios. No suspicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. No external data sources, network connections, or system modifications are evident. The code appears to be a simple, standard implementation of custom exceptions for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of custom exception classes used for error handling, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves its purpose for structured error management without introducing security concerns.",
