{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various client-related errors in an application",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; only class and exception definitions",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no processing of untrusted data or output",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths present in the code",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; code consists solely of exception class definitions with standard inheritance",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for client errors, including standard inheritance from Exception. The only noteworthy part is the constructor of RateLimitError, which optionally accepts a 'try_after' float, but this is typical for rate limiting logic and not inherently malicious. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward set of exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a standard pattern for error handling in Python applications.",
