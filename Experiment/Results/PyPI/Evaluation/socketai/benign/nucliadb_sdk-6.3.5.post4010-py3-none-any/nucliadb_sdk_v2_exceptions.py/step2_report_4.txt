  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to client errors.\n   - No external data, user input, network activity, or data processing occurs.\n   - The `RateLimitError` class includes an optional `try_after` parameter, which is standard for rate limiting scenarios.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no data flows, external inputs, or outputs.\n   - They note the optional `try_after` parameter in `RateLimitError`, which is typical and not suspicious.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning; the analysis is consistent and thorough.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, aligning with the straightforward, non-malicious nature of the code.\n   - The reasoning and scoring seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any risk above 0.5; all are 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The code is purely for error handling, with no security concerns.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, matching the analysis that there's no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's actual content.\n   - The only notable feature is the optional parameter in `RateLimitError`, which is standard and not suspicious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, straightforward implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, standard class definitions.\n- **Risk:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and serves a typical purpose in error handling. The reports' evaluations are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
