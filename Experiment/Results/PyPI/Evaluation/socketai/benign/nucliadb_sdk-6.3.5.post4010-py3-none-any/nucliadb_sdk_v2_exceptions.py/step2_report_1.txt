  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and applying critical reasoning.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for client errors.\n- All classes inherit from `ClientError`, which inherits from `Exception`.\n- The only class with additional logic is `RateLimitError`, which has an `__init__` method accepting an optional `try_after` float parameter.\n- There are no data flows, external input/output, network activity, or code execution beyond class definitions.\n- The code appears straightforward, well-structured, and standard for error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Reports 1-5** all consistently state:  \n- No external data reading or writing.  \n- No data flows or suspicious patterns.  \n- No obfuscation or malicious intent.  \n- The only notable aspect is the optional `try_after` parameter in `RateLimitError`, which is typical for rate-limiting scenarios.\n\n**Logical assessment:**\n- The code is purely class definitions for exceptions, with no runtime behavior or data processing.\n- The `try_after` parameter in `RateLimitError` is standard and does not imply malicious intent.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **No.** The code is standard, with no vulnerabilities, malware, or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  **No.** The reports correctly identify the code as straightforward and benign.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 0.5, which is appropriate given the content.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  The code contains no malicious code, no backdoors, no suspicious patterns.  \n  **Score should be 0.**  \n  The reports' scores of 0 are justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is transparent and readable; no obfuscation.  \n  **Score should be 0.**  \n  The reports' scores of 0 are justified.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Since there's no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and the code is standard,  \n  **score should be 0.**  \n  The reports' scores of 0 or 0.5 are reasonable; 0 is more precise.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate, and there are no security concerns.\n\n**My recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Work-through reasoning:**  \n- No data flows, external input, or code execution.  \n- Exception classes are simple and conventional.  \n- The only additional parameter is standard practice for rate limiting, not malicious.  \n- No signs of obfuscation or malware.  \n- The overall security risk is negligible.\n\nThis thorough analysis confirms the code's benign nature.",
