  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for client-related errors in a Python application.",
  "sources": "No input or external data read; only class definitions and inheritance.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or output involved.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code only defines exceptions and inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code execution, data handling, or suspicious patterns; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling various client errors. It includes a specialized constructor in RateLimitError to optionally handle a 'try_after' float value, but no external data sources, user input, or network activity is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The code is standard, well-structured, and contains no obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. The structure and content suggest it is purely for error handling, with no indication of malicious intent.",
