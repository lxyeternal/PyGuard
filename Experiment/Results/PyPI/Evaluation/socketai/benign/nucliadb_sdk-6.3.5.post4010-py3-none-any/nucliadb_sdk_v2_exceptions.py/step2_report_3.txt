  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions for handling client errors.\n   - No external data reading, writing, or processing occurs.\n   - The only notable feature is the optional `try_after` parameter in `RateLimitError`, which is standard in rate limiting scenarios.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment: the code is standard, well-structured, and contains no malicious patterns.\n   - They correctly identify that the `try_after` parameter is typical and not suspicious.\n   - No logical errors or overlooked issues are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Given the absence of any malicious or suspicious behavior, these scores are reasonable.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk here is 0, aligning with the conclusion that there's no security concern.\n   - The code is purely for error handling, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified.\n   - No malicious activity or code is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward analysis, with no unwarranted assumptions.\n   - The reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all are zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for a Python application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis indicates the code is safe, benign, and serves its purpose without any security concerns.",
