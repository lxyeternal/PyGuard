  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of individual reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes for client error handling.\n- They note the presence of a constructor in RateLimitError with an optional 'try_after' parameter, which is typical for rate limiting logic.\n- No external data sources, input reading, or data processing are involved.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware and security risk scores at 0.\n\n**Confirming the code's content:**\n- The code is purely class definitions inheriting from Exception.\n- The only notable feature is the optional 'try_after' parameter in RateLimitError's constructor, which is standard for rate limiting scenarios.\n- No code execution, data handling, or network activity is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Logical and scoring considerations:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, matching the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The security risk score is 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Potential for higher risk scores:**\n- Given the content, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The code does not contain any logic that could be exploited or used maliciously.\n- The optional parameter in the constructor does not introduce security concerns; it is standard practice.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of custom exception classes.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code snippet appears to be a standard, non-malicious component of a larger application’s error handling system. No further action is necessary.",
