  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling client-related errors in a Python application.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as this code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various client error exceptions, including a custom constructor for RateLimitError that allows an optional 'try_after' parameter. There are no input reads, external data processing, or security-sensitive operations. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and typical for exception handling in Python projects. No malicious or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
