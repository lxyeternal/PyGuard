  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various client-related errors in an application.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; code defines classes and imports typing.Optional.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow from untrusted sources or to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only declares exception classes without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions inheriting from Exception, with one class (RateLimitError) having an __init__ method that assigns an optional try_after parameter. All classes are standard custom exceptions with no external data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious patterns. The code is typical for a Python application to handle error states. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes for client errors, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
