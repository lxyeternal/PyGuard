  "purpose": "This code serves as a licensing header and version identifier for a Python module, containing no executable logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it consists solely of comments and a static variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects, as the code is purely static metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code does not process or transfer data dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign licensing header with a version string. It contains only comments and a static variable assignment, with no functions, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is typical for a module header and does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign licensing header with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
