{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set metadata for a Python package or module, including licensing and versioning information.",
  "sources": "The only source is the file header comments and the __version__ variable assignment.",
  "targets": "There are no identifiable sinks or data flow targets; no untrusted data sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as there are no input handling or processing operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior are present; the code is straightforward and only contains metadata comments and a version variable.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard license header followed by a version variable assignment. It does not contain executable logic, input/output operations, or data handling. The comments specify licensing terms, and the version string is a static variable assignment, which is common in package versioning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only licensing information and version metadata. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
