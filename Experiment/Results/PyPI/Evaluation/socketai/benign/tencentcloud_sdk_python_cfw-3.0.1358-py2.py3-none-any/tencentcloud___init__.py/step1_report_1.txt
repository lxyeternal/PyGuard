  "purpose": "The code appears to be a licensing and version declaration for a Python module, likely part of a larger project or library.",
  "sources": "No active input or data reading; the code only contains comments, license, and version assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as there are no executable statements or data manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is solely composed of licensing comments and a version variable assignment, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily license and copyright comments, followed by a version string assignment. There are no functions, no data processing, no external data reads, or executable logic that could be malicious. It appears to be a standard header for a source file. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard licensing header with version info and contains no malicious or security-related issues. It is a benign part of a larger codebase.",
