  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks exists in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward and standard for licensing headers.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of licensing comments and a version variable assignment. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or contain executable logic that could be malicious.
