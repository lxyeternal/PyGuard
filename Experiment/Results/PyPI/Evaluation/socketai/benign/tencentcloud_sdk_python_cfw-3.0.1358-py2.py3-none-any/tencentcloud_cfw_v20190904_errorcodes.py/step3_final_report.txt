{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of string constants representing various API error codes and messages for use in error handling and response interpretation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the static constant definitions; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code consists solely of static assignments without dynamic data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of constant string definitions for error codes, with licensing and comments. It contains no functions, input/output, or dynamic logic. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The code serves as a static reference for error handling, typical in SDKs or API clients. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's benign and straightforward nature. No further security concerns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign constants module for error codes, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk features. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
