  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code in detail.\n\n**Code Content Review:**\n- The code is a straightforward collection of string constants representing various error codes and messages.\n- It contains only static assignments, comments, and licensing information.\n- There are no functions, data flows, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are present.\n- The code serves as a constants module, likely for an SDK or API client.\n\n**Assessment of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- They correctly identify that the code is purely declarative, with no data processing or external interactions.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent are detected across all reports.\n- The confidence levels are all high (1.0), and the analysis aligns with the code content.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable since there's no security risk or malicious activity.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n- The only notable aspect is that these are constants for error handling, which by itself doesn't pose security risks.\n- No assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent and justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately assess the code.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n- No further action or adjustment is necessary.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the actual code content. The code is benign, standard, and poses no security risks.",
