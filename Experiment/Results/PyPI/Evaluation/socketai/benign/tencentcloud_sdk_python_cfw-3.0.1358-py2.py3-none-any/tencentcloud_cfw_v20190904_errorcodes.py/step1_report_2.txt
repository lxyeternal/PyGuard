{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of string constants representing various error codes and statuses related to an API or SDK, likely for handling error responses and status checks.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code only contains constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows; the code is a static set of constant assignments without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and consists solely of string constant definitions. No obfuscated or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple collection of error code constants, possibly used for error handling in an API SDK. It includes license information and a list of predefined string constants with descriptive names. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors. The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or contain suspicious logic. The only notable aspect is the presence of license and copyright comments, which are standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of constant definitions for error and status codes, with no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. It is a typical boilerplate for API error handling.",
