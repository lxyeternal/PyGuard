{
  "purpose": "Define a set of constant string variables representing various error and status codes used in Tencent Cloud's API responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads from predefined constant assignments; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations; the code is purely defining constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as this code only contains constant declarations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard for defining error codes; no suspicious or unusual behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of string constants for various error conditions and status codes related to Tencent Cloud services. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, or external interactions. The only potential concern is that these constants are defined at the top of the file, but they do not perform any malicious actions. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical constants definition file for error codes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign and likely part of a larger SDK or API client implementation.",
