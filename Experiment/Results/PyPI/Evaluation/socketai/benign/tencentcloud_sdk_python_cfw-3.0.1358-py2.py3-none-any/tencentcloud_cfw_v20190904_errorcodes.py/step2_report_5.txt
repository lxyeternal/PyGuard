  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is solely a collection of string constants defining error codes and messages. There are no functions, input/output handling, dynamic code execution, or any form of data processing. The code is static and declarative.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**  \n   The reports consistently state that the code is benign, standard, and typical for an SDK or API client library. No logical flaws or suspicious patterns are identified. The analysis is thorough and aligns with the code content.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a higher risk score. The code is purely static, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Claims About Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make any assumptions about vulnerabilities; they simply state the code's purpose and content.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Report Content:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis—no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.**  \nThere are no grounds for raising the malware, obfuscation, or risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate after review:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**This aligns with the reports and the code content.**",
