  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward set of constant definitions for error codes and messages.\n   - No input handling, data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - No obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious logic are detected.\n   - The code is standard for SDK or API client libraries.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The reports do not identify any errors or flaws.\n   - The code appears syntactically correct and logically appropriate for its purpose.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward constant definitions.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since there is no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Claims about Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n   - They recognize the code as purely declarative.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n   - The conclusion that the code is benign and poses no security risk is justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a benign constants module with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the detailed reviews and the nature of the code, I concur with the provided assessments. No additional risks are identified.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is purely a set of constant definitions for error handling.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or vulnerable aspects are present.\n- Scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\nNo changes needed. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
