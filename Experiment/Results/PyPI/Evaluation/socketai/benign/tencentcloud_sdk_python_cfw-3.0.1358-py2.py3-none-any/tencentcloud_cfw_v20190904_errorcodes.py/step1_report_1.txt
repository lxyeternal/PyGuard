  "purpose": "Define and standardize error codes and messages related to authentication, parameter validation, resource management, and operation statuses for Tencent cloud services.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines constants and string messages.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external output that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "None; the code is purely declarative, setting constants for error codes.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward collection of constant definitions representing various error codes and messages used for API responses or internal error handling. It includes only string assignments with no functions, input/output operations, or data flows. There are no indications of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior. The structure and content are typical of a standard SDK or API client library for cloud services. No suspicious or anomalous code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a constants module for error handling messages. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
