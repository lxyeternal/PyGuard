  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple collection of string constants defining error codes and messages.\n   - There are no functions, input/output operations, data flows, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code contains only static assignments, standard comments, and licensing information.\n   - No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious or Security Risks**:\n   - The reports explicitly state that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, data leakage, or malicious behavior.\n   - Given the nature of the code, which is purely defining constants, this assessment is consistent and reasonable.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence level is 1.0, reflecting certainty in these assessments.\n\n4. **Any Logical Flaws or Inconsistencies**:\n   - No issues found; the reports are consistent with each other.\n   - The reasoning is sound: static constant definitions pose no security threat.\n\n5. **Overall Justification**:\n   - Since the code is a straightforward constants module, the risk scores should remain low.\n   - The malware score should be 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score should be 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The overall security risk is 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nBased on the provided reports and analysis, I agree with the current scores. The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the content.\n\n**Note**: No further action is necessary. The code is safe and standard for error code definitions in SDKs or API clients.",
