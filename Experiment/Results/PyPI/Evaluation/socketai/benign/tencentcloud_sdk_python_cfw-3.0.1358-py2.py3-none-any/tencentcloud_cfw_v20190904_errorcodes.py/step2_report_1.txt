  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of constant string definitions representing error codes and messages.\n   - There are no functions, input/output operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious patterns, or hidden logic are present.\n   - The code is purely declarative, serving as a constants module for API error handling.\n\n2. **Malicious or Security Risks:**\n   - All reports unanimously state that the code is benign, with a malware score of 0.\n   - No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious intent are identified.\n   - The code does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain any dynamic or executable logic that could be exploited.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Flaws:**\n   - No vulnerabilities are evident; the code is straightforward and standard for defining error codes.\n   - The presence of license headers and descriptive comments is typical and does not introduce security issues.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security concern.\n\n5. **Consistency and Justification:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features, no score adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign constants module, with no security risks or malicious intent. It is typical boilerplate code used in SDKs or API clients for error handling.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. No further action or concern is warranted.",
