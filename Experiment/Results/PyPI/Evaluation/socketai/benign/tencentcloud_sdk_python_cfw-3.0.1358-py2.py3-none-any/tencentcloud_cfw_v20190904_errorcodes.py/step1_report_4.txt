{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of string constants representing various error and status codes related to an API or SDK, likely for handling responses and exceptions in a cloud or service environment.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or effects are present, as the code only assigns constant string values.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as the code only defines constants without dynamic data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely consists of constant definitions with descriptive comments; there are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a collection of string constants used as standardized status or error codes. It includes licensing information and comments, but no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code. The absence of input handling, data flows, or external interactions indicates this is purely a reference or configuration module.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign set of constant definitions for API response codes. It contains no malicious intent or security risks and appears to be a standard part of an SDK or API client library.",
