  "purpose": "Define and document various error and status code constants related to Tencent Cloud API responses.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources; the code consists solely of constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only declares constants without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only constant string definitions with standard error messages, no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of constant variable assignments representing error codes and messages for API responses. There are no functions, data processing, or input/output operations. The license and copyright comments are standard, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The constants are named and valued in a conventional manner aligned with typical API error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign set of constant definitions for error codes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
