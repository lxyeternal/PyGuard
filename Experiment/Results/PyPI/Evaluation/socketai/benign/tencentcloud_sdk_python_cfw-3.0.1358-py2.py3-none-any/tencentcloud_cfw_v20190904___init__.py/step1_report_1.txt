  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a basic Python script that performs some data processing or utility functions. No explicit intent for malicious activity is apparent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and possibly from user input or external files, depending on specific functions used.",
  "sinks": "Data may be written to files, printed to stdout, or sent over network connections if present. No direct untrusted sinks are evident in the snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or user inputs (sources) to outputs like files or network (sinks), but no suspicious flow is evident from the code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are observed. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features are present. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with standard Python constructs. It does not include dynamic execution, obfuscated segments, or suspicious patterns. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration activities. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The usage of libraries appears typical for utility scripts. Based on the visible code, there are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears benign, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It functions as a typical utility script without security issues. Given the limited context, the confidence is high that this code is safe.",
