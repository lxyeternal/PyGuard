  "sources": "Potential sources include reading input from user input, environment variables, or reading files; however, no specific data sources are identifiable without code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be network connections, file writes, or executing system commands; but no explicit sinks are visible in the provided code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks can be established as the code content is absent.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are detected due to lack of code provided.",
  "analysis": "Unable to perform step-by-step analysis due to absence of code. Without specific code snippets, no source, sink, or flow can be identified. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies are observable.",
  "conclusion": "No code provided for review; therefore, no malicious behavior or security risks can be identified. The code appears benign or unobservable without actual code content.",
