  "purpose": "Unit tests for the get_string_property method of the ApplicationProperties class, validating configuration retrieval and validation logic.",
  "sources": "Input sources include configuration dictionary data loaded into ApplicationProperties via load_from_dict.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that send untrusted data to external systems, file writes, network, or other sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the configuration dictionary (source) into get_string_property, with validation functions applied. No external or untrusted data is transmitted or used in unsafe ways.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Validation functions raise exceptions, but this is standard testing behavior. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code present. The code is straightforward and focused on unit testing.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of test functions for a configuration property class, loading data into an object and verifying retrieval and validation logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network access, system modification, or data exfiltration. Validation functions are used solely within the test scope. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious data handling are present. The code appears to be standard test code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of unit tests validating configuration property retrieval and validation logic. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and solely intended for testing purposes.",
