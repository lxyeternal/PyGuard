  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the ApplicationProperties class, verifying configuration loading, property retrieval, and validation logic.",
  "sources": "Static dictionaries within test functions, method calls on ApplicationProperties instance",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external system interactions or data leaks",
  "flows": "Loading configuration data into ApplicationProperties, then retrieving and validating properties through method calls",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard validation and exception handling only",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests that load static configuration dictionaries, perform assertions, and handle exceptions for invalid inputs. There are no external data sources, network activity, or system modifications. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and only intended for validation purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The exception messages and validation logic are standard and do not indicate any malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a safe, standard unit test suite for configuration management with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
