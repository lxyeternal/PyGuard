  "purpose": "Unit tests for the ApplicationPropertiesFacade class, verifying behavior with different inputs and configurations.",
  "sources": "Reading input from hardcoded dictionaries (`config_map`) and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network operations, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input data loaded into ApplicationProperties, then accessed via ApplicationPropertiesFacade methods, with no untrusted data flowing into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test functions validating the behavior of ApplicationPropertiesFacade with various configurations. It uses local data structures and standard assertions. No external inputs, outputs, or potentially malicious operations are present. The code's logic is straightforward, focused on validation, and does not involve any suspicious or harmful activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be safe, standard unit testing code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
