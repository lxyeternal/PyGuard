{
  "purpose": "The code implements file change reloading mechanisms for Python applications, primarily using polling or inotify (Linux-specific) to monitor file modifications and trigger callbacks, typically used in development environments for auto-reloading.",
  "sources": "Reads module.__file__ for loaded modules, os.path and os.stat for file paths and modification times, environment variables (sys.platform), and extra_files provided during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Invokes the callback function upon detecting file changes; no direct untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Gets file list from sys.modules, checks file modification times, invokes callback if changes detected; in inotify mode, monitors directories for events, triggering callbacks on events.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard; no suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. Uses standard modules for monitoring files. No malicious or privacy-intrusive code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical implementation of a file watcher for reloading purposes, using polling and optional inotify support on Linux. It gathers module file paths and monitors their modification times to trigger callbacks on changes. The inotify implementation sets up directory watches and responds to filesystem events. No code indicates malicious intent, backdoors, data theft, or system harm. The only external dependency is the inotify library, which is checked for and used if available.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate file watcher used for development reloading, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions as intended for its purpose, and there is no evidence of malicious or security-compromising code.",
