  "sources": "sys.modules file paths, extra_files set, environment variables (indirectly via os.stat), inotify filesystem events.",
  "sinks": "The callback function invoked upon file change detection, which could execute arbitrary code if malicious.",
  "flows": "File paths obtained from sys.modules and extra_files → modification time checks via os.stat or inotify events → callback invoked on change.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Standard implementation of file monitoring.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard file reloader using polling and optional inotify support on Linux. It gathers module file paths, monitors their modification times, and invokes a user-defined callback when changes are detected. The inotify integration is properly handled with fallback behavior. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The callback's external nature is typical but introduces potential risk if the callback is malicious, which is outside the code's scope. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the code's benign purpose and external callback dependency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard development utility for file change detection. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of the callback function, which is external. The scores and assessments across reports are consistent and justified.",
