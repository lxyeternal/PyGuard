{
  "purpose": "The code implements file change detection for a reloader, typically used in development servers to automatically reload code when source files change.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ attribute of modules, sys.modules, os.stat, os.path, environment variables, and user-provided filenames.",
  "sinks": "os.stat to check file modification times, inotify module (if available) for filesystem event monitoring, and callback invocation upon file change detection.",
  "flows": "Modules' __file__ attributes -> get_files() or get_dirs() -> os.stat() or inotify event -> callback execution upon detecting file changes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Use of standard modules and typical reloader logic. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Conditional import of inotify based on platform and availability.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: Reloader (polling-based) and InotifyReloader (event-based, Linux-specific). The Reloader tracks file modification times to trigger callbacks. The InotifyReloader uses the inotify library for efficient filesystem event monitoring, if available. The code conditionally sets preferred reloader based on platform support and presence of inotify. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code performs standard development reloading functions with proper error handling for missing modules. No hardcoded secrets, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a file change reloader used for development purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its functionality aligns with typical development tooling, and there are no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
