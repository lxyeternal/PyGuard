  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for server control and configuration errors in a Python application.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading sources present).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output or external communication present).",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks due to lack of input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code defines standard custom exceptions with no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes: HaltServer, ConfigError, and AppImportError. HaltServer inherits from BaseException and includes a custom __str__ method for displaying reason and exit status. The other two are simple subclasses of Exception with descriptive docstrings. There are no input, output, network operations, or obfuscated code. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard exception class definitions for server and application error handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
