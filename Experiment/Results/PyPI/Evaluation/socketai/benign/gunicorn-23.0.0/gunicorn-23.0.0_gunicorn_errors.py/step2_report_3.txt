  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes, including HaltServer inheriting from BaseException with a custom __str__ method, and two other simple exception subclasses.\n- The code is straightforward, with no input/output, external data handling, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The comments clarify design choices, but do not introduce malicious intent.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.\n- The code appears to be part of a server framework (notably Gunicorn), serving as internal exception classes.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The inheritance from BaseException for HaltServer is intentional to prevent application-level catching, which is a common pattern for critical control flow exceptions like server shutdown signals.\n- No external data, secrets, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code is standard, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no adjustments needed.\n- The reasoning is sound, and the conclusions align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a straightforward, benign implementation of custom exceptions for server control and error handling. The detailed reports correctly identify the lack of malicious or suspicious behavior. No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
