  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes: HaltServer (inherits from BaseException with custom __str__), ConfigError, and AppImportError.\n- No external data, network activity, or input/output flows involving untrusted data are present.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors.\n- The purpose is clearly to facilitate error handling within a server or application framework, likely Gunicorn.\n- The comments and structure indicate standard, benign code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **HaltServer** inherits from BaseException intentionally to prevent application-level catch, which is a common pattern for control flow during server shutdown. Its __str__ method is standard.\n- **ConfigError** and **AppImportError** are simple subclasses of Exception, with no additional logic or data.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or malicious activity.\n- The comments clarify design choices but do not introduce suspicious behavior.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5. Given the benign nature, a score of 0 is justified. No security risks or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only slight point to consider is the inheritance of HaltServer from BaseException, which is standard for control flow exceptions that should not be caught by application code. This is a common pattern in server frameworks and not malicious.\n- No assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is standard, benign, and intended for internal error handling.\n- The scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n- No malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The code is safe, with no security risks.",
