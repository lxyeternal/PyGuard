  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and standard for a server framework like Gunicorn.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Obfuscated: 0  \n   - Malware: 0  \n   - Security Risk: 0  \n   - Confidence: 1\n\n   These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   Since all scores are 0, there's no need to justify higher risk scores. The code is clearly safe.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on direct code analysis, noting the absence of dynamic or suspicious features.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report Content**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nThis code is a standard, well-documented set of exception class definitions for internal use within a server framework. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The consistent high confidence scores and zero malware/obfuscation scores are justified.\n\n**Summary**:  \n**Malware**: 0  \n**Obfuscated**: 0  \n**Risk**: 0\n\nNo changes are necessary; the code is benign and secure.",
