{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for server control and configuration errors in a Python application, specifically related to Gunicorn server operations.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and methods with no input reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; classes are used for exception handling only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code contains straightforward class definitions and comments explaining design choices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes (HaltServer, ConfigError, AppImportError) for specific error handling scenarios in a server environment. HaltServer inherits from BaseException to prevent it from being caught at application level unintentionally. The class implementations are simple, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. No data is read from external sources or written to external systems. The code adheres to Python conventions and contains helpful comments for maintainers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for server management and error reporting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues.",
