  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for server control and configuration errors.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of custom exceptions, especially HaltServer which takes reason and exit status.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data used in a way that affects system security.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes: HaltServer, ConfigError, and AppImportError. HaltServer inherits from BaseException to avoid being caught at application level, which is intentional for control flow during server shutdown. The __init__ and __str__ methods are standard, with no dynamic code execution or unsafe behaviors. The other two classes are simple exception declarations without additional logic. There are no hardcoded secrets, external data reads, or malicious constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, safe exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
