{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for internal server control and error handling, specifically HaltServer to signal server shutdown without application-level catching, and ConfigError and AppImportError for configuration and application import issues.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for HaltServer, ConfigError, and AppImportError; no external data or input sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; exception classes are used internally for control flow and error reporting.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow involving untrusted sources; exception raising and handling are standard control flow mechanisms.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with clear intent. The inheritance of HaltServer from BaseException is a deliberate design choice for control flow, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with HaltServer inheriting from BaseException to prevent application-level catching, and two simple subclasses of Exception. There is no input/output, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. Comments clarify design choices. The code is standard for server frameworks like Gunicorn. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and justified based on the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of internal exception classes for server control and error handling. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
