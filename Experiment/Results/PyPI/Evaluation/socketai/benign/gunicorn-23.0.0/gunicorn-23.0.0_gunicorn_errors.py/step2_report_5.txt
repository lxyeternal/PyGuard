  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining three custom exception classes: `HaltServer`, `ConfigError`, and `AppImportError`.\n- The `HaltServer` class inherits from `BaseException` with a custom `__str__` method, intended to prevent it from being caught by application-level exception handlers.\n- The other two are straightforward subclasses of `Exception`.\n- No input/output, network activity, or data handling is involved.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The comments and code structure are standard and align with typical server or framework exception handling.\n\n**Confirmation of code correctness and security:**\n- The code matches the description and appears to be standard, benign exception class definitions.\n- There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- The design choice for `HaltServer` inheriting from `BaseException` is intentional for control flow during server shutdown, not suspicious.\n- The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, data parsing, or external interactions.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n- These are consistent with the analysis and seem appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues or points of critique:**\n- The only notable aspect is the inheritance of `HaltServer` from `BaseException`. While this is a common pattern in server frameworks to prevent such exceptions from being caught accidentally, it could be misused if someone introduces malicious exception handling elsewhere. However, in this context, it appears to be a deliberate, benign design choice.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent.\n- The analysis correctly identifies the benign nature of these exception classes.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for server control and error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
