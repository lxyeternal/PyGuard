  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions: `HaltServer`, `ConfigError`, and `AppImportError`.\n- `HaltServer` inherits from `BaseException` with a custom `__str__` method, intended to prevent it from being caught at application level.\n- The other two are simple subclasses of `Exception`.\n- No input/output, external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- Comments clarify design choices but do not introduce suspicious behavior.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- The code appears to be part of a server framework (like Gunicorn), serving as internal exception handling classes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of malicious activity or malware:** No, the code is benign.\n- **Obfuscation or hidden behavior:** No, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Vulnerabilities or security risks:** None apparent; exception classes are standard.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n\n- No logical flaws are evident. The code is simple, well-structured, and comments clarify design choices.\n- The decision to inherit `HaltServer` from `BaseException` is intentional for control flow, not suspicious.\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0 for all, as there are no security risks.\n\n### Potential issues with the reports:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify the purpose and benign nature of the code.\n- The high confidence scores (1) are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' conclusions.** The code is standard, safe, and intended for internal exception handling within a server framework. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a benign set of custom exception classes, with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
