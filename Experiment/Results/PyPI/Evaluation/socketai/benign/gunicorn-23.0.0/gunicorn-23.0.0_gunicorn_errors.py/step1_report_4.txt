  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for server control and configuration errors",
  "sources": "None; no input or external data reading",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or external system interaction",
  "flows": "None; no data flow paths present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definitions with comments",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes: HaltServer (inherits from BaseException), ConfigError, and AppImportError (both inherit from Exception). The HaltServer class is designed to be used for controlling server shutdowns, and includes a reason and exit status. The other two classes are simple exception subclasses for configuration and application import errors. No input reading, data leaks, insecure behavior, or suspicious activity is present. The code contains licensing comments and explanatory comments about exception handling. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or external connections.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious or security issues.",
