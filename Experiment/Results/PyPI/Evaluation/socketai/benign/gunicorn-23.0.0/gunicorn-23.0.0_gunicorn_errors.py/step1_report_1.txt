{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for server control and error handling in a Python application, likely related to a server or application framework.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user inputs are read in this code.",
  "targets": "No data sinks or output channels are present; no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no input-output flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class definitions with no unusual language features, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exceptions: HaltServer inherits from BaseException with a custom __str__ method, likely to prevent this exception from being caught by application-level exception handlers; ConfigError and AppImportError are standard exception subclasses for specific error scenarios. The comments clarify design choices but do not introduce suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malicious code, secret backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code appears to be part of a larger server application (notably Gunicorn) and is standard for such contexts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of custom exception classes intended for internal use within a server framework. No malicious activity, malware, or security risks are evident.",
