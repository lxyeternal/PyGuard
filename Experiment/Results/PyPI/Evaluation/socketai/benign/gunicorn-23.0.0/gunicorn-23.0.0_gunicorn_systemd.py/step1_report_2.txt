{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for systemd socket activation and notifications in a Gunicorn environment.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('LISTEN_FDS', 'LISTEN_PID', 'NOTIFY_SOCKET') and socket connection for notifications.",
  "sinks": "Uses socket to send data to systemd via Unix domain socket; pops environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> conditional logic -> socket connection -> sending data; environment cleanup after socket operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no unusual code patterns. Use of socket and environment variables is standard for systemd interaction.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly interacts with systemd socket activation and notification mechanisms. It reads environment variables to determine socket counts and sends notifications over a Unix domain socket, cleaning up environment variables if instructed. No code injections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The socket creation and data transmission are standard for systemd integrations. No obfuscation or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation for systemd socket activation and notifications. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It manages environment variables carefully and uses socket communication appropriately.",
