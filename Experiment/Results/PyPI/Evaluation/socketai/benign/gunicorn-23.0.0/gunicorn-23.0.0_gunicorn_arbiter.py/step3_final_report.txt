{
  "purpose": "The code manages worker processes for Gunicorn, handling signals, reloading, spawning, and shutdown procedures to ensure server stability and control.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., GUNICORN_PID, GUNICORN_FD), signals (HUP, QUIT, INT, TERM, USR1, USR2, WINCH), socket descriptors, command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Process control functions such as os.execvpe, os.fork, os.kill, os.waitpid, environment variable modifications, socket creation and closure.",
  "flows": "Signals received trigger handlers that may spawn, reload, or terminate workers; environment variables influence process re-execution; socket descriptors are passed during reexec; process lifecycle flows from fork to exec and termination.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code uses standard UNIX process management practices; no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical process arbiter for Gunicorn, employing standard signal handling, environment variable management, process forking, re-execution, and socket management. It does not contain any malicious or obfuscated code. The process control mechanisms are consistent with UNIX server process management. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified given the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured server process manager with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It employs standard practices for process control, signal handling, and environment management, and poses minimal security risk.",
