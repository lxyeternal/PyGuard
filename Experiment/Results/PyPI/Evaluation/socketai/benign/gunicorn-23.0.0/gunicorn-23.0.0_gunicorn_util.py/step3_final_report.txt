{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for process management, network address parsing, dynamic module loading, and HTTP response handling within Gunicorn server environment.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input parameters, network address strings, module import statements, system calls.",
  "sinks": "Socket write operations, system privilege modifications (setgid, setuid), module attribute access, environment variable reads.",
  "flows": "Input data from environment variables or parameters flows into socket writes, module imports, and process privilege functions; dynamic imports and attribute access lead to application execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious data flows detected. Use of system privilege functions is standard for server setup routines.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard server utility functions such as dynamic module loading, process privilege management, address parsing, and socket I/O. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The functions operate as expected in a server context, with typical use of environment variables, system calls, and dynamic imports. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified, and the low security risk score of 0.2 reflects inherent risks in privilege modifications but remains appropriate given the controlled environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate server utility code with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis, indicating a safe and standard implementation.",
