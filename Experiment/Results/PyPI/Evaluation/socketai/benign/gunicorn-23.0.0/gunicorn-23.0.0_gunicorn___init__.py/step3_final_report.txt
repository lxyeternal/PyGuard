  "purpose": "Define static version information and server identification strings for a Python application.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version tuple and string formatting for server info.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs involved.",
  "flows": "Static data assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static declaration of version and server info, with no dynamic or external data sources. It performs string concatenation and formatting with fixed values. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is purely informational, serving as metadata for the application. All signals indicate benign, straightforward code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, static, and standard for version and server info declaration. There are no security risks, malicious activity, or obfuscation. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
