  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Concatenation of version parts to form __version__, and string formatting for SERVER_SOFTWARE.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and adheres to common patterns for version and server info.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a version tuple, joins it into a version string, and constructs a server software string with fixed values. No external input, no dynamic data processing, and no sensitive information handling are present. The code appears to be purely informational and standard for package or application version reporting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely defines version and server information without external dependencies or unsafe practices.",
