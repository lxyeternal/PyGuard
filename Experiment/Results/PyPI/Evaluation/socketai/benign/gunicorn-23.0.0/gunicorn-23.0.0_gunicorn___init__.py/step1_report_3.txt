  "purpose": "Define version and server information for Gunicorn server",
  "sources": "version_info tuple and string formatting for __version__ and SERVER_SOFTWARE",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; only internal variable assignments and string formatting",
  "flows": "Assign version_info -> __version__, then format to SERVER_SOFTWARE",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and only involves setting version info and server name",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version tuple, converts it to a string, and constructs server identification strings. All operations are static and based on predefined data. There are no inputs from external sources, no dynamic code execution, no secrets, and no suspicious network activity. The code appears to be part of a standard software component (Gunicorn) setup or versioning, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version declaration and server identification snippet with no malicious intent or security risks.",
