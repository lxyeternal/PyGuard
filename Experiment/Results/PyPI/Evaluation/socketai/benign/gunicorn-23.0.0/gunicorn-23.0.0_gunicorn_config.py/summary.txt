  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign configuration module for Gunicorn, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The potential risks are related to misconfiguration or malicious inputs in class paths and environment variables, but these are typical and controlled through validation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.2 due to potential misuse of inputs, but no active malicious activity is detected."
