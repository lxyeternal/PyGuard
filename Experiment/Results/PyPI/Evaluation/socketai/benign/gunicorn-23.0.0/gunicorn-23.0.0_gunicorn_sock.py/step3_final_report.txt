{
  "purpose": "The code manages socket creation, configuration, binding, SSL context setup, and cleanup for a server environment, supporting TCP, IPv6, UNIX sockets, and SSL/TLS encryption.",
  "sources": "Socket creation functions, configuration parameters (address, SSL cert/key files), filesystem checks for SSL files, environment variables for socket options.",
  "sinks": "Socket options setting, binding to addresses, SSL context wrapping, socket closure, filesystem modifications (removing existing UNIX socket files).",
  "flows": "Input parameters (addresses, SSL cert/key files) → socket creation and configuration → binding and SSL wrapping → socket listening and data handling → cleanup and closure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. SSL files are checked for existence before use. No unusual data flows or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of socket management routines with SSL support, including error handling, retries, and filesystem checks. It uses well-established socket options and SSL context configurations. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality, which is typical for server socket setup routines. External SSL files are validated for existence, and socket options are set securely. The code does not contain any signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and routine socket management module suitable for a server environment like Gunicorn. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The low risk score appropriately reflects the minimal operational risks associated with socket configuration and external SSL dependencies.",
