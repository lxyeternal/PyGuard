  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package 'streamlit-image-coordinates' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; no other external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or external data transmission points detected.",
  "flows": "Read file (README.md) -> package setup configuration; no data flows to external systems or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and a popular packaging library. It reads a local README.md file for long description, which is common in setup scripts. The setup() function uses hardcoded package metadata, dependencies, and configuration settings. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or data leaks. All operations are straightforward package setup procedures. No suspicious or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It follows typical patterns for publishing a Python package on PyPI.",
