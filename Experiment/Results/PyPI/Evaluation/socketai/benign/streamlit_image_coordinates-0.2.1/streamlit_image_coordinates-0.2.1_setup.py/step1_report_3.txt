  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python Streamlit component that displays an image and returns coordinates upon click.",
  "sources": "Reads __file__ to determine the directory, reads README.md for long description, and package requirements from install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or data leakage points are present.",
  "flows": "Path: __file__ -> Path operations / README.md reading; install_requires influences package dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious dynamic code execution observed. The code is standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations: determines current directory, reads a markdown file, and configures package setup parameters via setuptools. No external input is processed in a way that could lead to code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity. Dependencies are explicitly listed, and no network calls or hidden behaviors are present. The structure adheres to common packaging practices, and there are no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup.py file for packaging a Python project, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and intended solely for packaging purposes.",
