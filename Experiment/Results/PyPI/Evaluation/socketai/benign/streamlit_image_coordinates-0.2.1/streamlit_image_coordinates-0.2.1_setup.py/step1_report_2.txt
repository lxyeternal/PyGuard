{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Streamlit component that displays an image and returns click coordinates",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and gathers package data from the 'src' directory",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, no network or file manipulation beyond setup",
  "flows": "Reads description from a file and specifies package metadata and dependencies, with no runtime data flow",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs; standard setup routine",
  "analysis": "The script imports pathlib for file path management and setuptools for packaging. It reads a markdown file for long description and configures the package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are typical for Python package setup and do not include any code injection, network activity, or other malicious behavior. The code structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks. No suspicious activity or malware indicators are present.",
