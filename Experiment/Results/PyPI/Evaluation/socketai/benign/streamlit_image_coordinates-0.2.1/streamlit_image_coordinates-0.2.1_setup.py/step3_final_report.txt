{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads README.md for description and configures package metadata using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description, uses static package metadata, and imports from pathlib and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network calls, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> passes static data to setuptools.setup() -> completes package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a local README file and supplies static metadata to setuptools. No dynamic or malicious code is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk scores. The only minor discrepancy is report 5's securityRisk score of 0.1, which should be adjusted to 0 for accuracy, as the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, safe packaging script with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate; only report 5's risk score should be corrected to 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
