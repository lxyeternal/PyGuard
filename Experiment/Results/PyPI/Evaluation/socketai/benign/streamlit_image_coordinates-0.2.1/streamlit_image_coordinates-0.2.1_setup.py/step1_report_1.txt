{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'streamlit-image-coordinates' Python library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__file__' variable to determine the current directory and reads the content of 'README.md' for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the setup configurations do not involve untrusted data execution or external calls that could be malicious.",
  "flows": "Reads the file path to load package description → Passes data into setuptools.setup() → Packages and metadata are configured for distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. The code performs standard package setup routines.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes paths and reads the README file for description, then calls setuptools.setup() with standard package metadata and dependencies. There are no dynamic or risky code execution, no external commands, and no handling of untrusted input. The code strictly follows typical Python packaging conventions without anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard setup operations safely.",
