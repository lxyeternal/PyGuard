  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'streamlit-image-coordinates', defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; no other input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions that process untrusted input; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations other than standard setup.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; the code primarily reads a file for description and sets package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Path' from pathlib for file path manipulations and 'setuptools' for package setup. It reads the content of README.md for the long description. The setup() function specifies package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and other configuration parameters, all consistent with normal package publishing procedures. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. All actions are typical for a Python setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard Python package setup file with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not contain any malware, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears safe and conventional.",
