{
  "purpose": "Provides a Streamlit component for displaying images from various sources (URL, local file, numpy array, or object with save method) and capturing click coordinates.",
  "sources": "Reads image data from string URL, local file path, numpy array, or object with save method; reads frontend directory for component declaration.",
  "sinks": "Encodes images into base64 data URLs and passes them to a custom frontend component; captures user click coordinates and timestamps.",
  "flows": "Source data (URL, file, array, object) -> encode to base64 -> embed as data URL -> pass to component -> user clicks -> capture coordinates and time.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles image inputs, encodes them properly, and uses a standard custom Streamlit component. It does not perform network requests beyond referencing local files or URLs, nor does it execute untrusted code. The implementation is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. External URLs are embedded as data URLs, minimizing external risks. The code's structure and libraries are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for image display and coordinate capture in Streamlit. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk stems from accepting external URLs, but since images are embedded as data URLs, actual threat is negligible.",
