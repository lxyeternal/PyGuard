  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for image display and coordinate capture in Streamlit. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk stems from accepting external URLs, but since images are embedded as data URLs, actual threat is negligible."
