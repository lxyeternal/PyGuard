{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Streamlit component to display images from various sources and capture click coordinates, returning click events and related data.",
  "sources": "Image sources include URLs, local file paths, and objects with a 'save' method; these are read or processed to generate image data URIs.",
  "sinks": "Generated base64-encoded image data URIs; the code outputs data for a custom Streamlit component but does not directly send data externally or to untrusted endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input sources (URLs, local files, numpy arrays) are converted into base64 data URIs, which are passed to a custom frontend component; no external data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Use of third-party libraries is standard and expected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles image input by supporting common formats and sources, converting them into data URIs. It defines a custom Streamlit component for image interaction, with parameter validation. There are no evident malicious behaviors, such as network communication to unknown domains, data exfiltration, or code injection. The only external interaction is the declaration of a custom component, which is typical for Streamlit extensions. No suspicious or harmful code constructs or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign implementation of a Streamlit image coordinate capturing component. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this code. It is a straightforward, well-structured utility for image display and interaction.",
