{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Streamlit component for displaying images and capturing user click coordinates, supporting various image sources and formats.",
  "sources": "Reads image data from file paths, URLs, numpy arrays, and objects with a save method.",
  "sinks": "Encodes image data to base64 strings for display, passes data to a custom frontend component.",
  "flows": "Image source -> encoding to base64 -> passing to frontend component; user clicks -> coordinates sent back from frontend.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No use of insecure functions or eval-like dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image processing and streamlit component declaration with typical libraries (base64, PIL, numpy). It reads images from local files or URLs, encodes them, and displays them via a custom component. No network or system-level malicious behavior is observed. The component appears to be a visualization tool for image coordinate selection, with no indication of data exfiltration, command execution, or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign image display and coordinate capture utility for Streamlit with no malicious intent or malicious code identified. It is securely implemented, and no security risks are evident.",
