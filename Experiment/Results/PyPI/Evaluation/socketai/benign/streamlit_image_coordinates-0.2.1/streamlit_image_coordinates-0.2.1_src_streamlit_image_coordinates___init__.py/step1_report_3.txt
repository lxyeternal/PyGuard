{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Streamlit component for displaying images and capturing click coordinates, supporting images from various sources and formats.",
  "sources": "Image source inputs from URLs, file paths, numpy arrays, or objects with a save method; user interactions via the Streamlit component.",
  "sinks": "Base64-encoded image data strings, passing image data to a frontend component, and returning user click data.",
  "flows": "Image data is read from source, converted to base64-encoded string, passed to frontend component; user interactions generate coordinate data sent back to the Streamlit app.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden functionalities. The code correctly handles different image sources and formats.",
  "analysis": "The code carefully handles various image input types, converting them to base64 strings for frontend display. No data leaks, insecure data handling, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code does not perform any network requests beyond referencing a local frontend directory. No obfuscated code or misleading variable usage is present. It uses standard libraries and safe methods for data handling. The frontend component is declared via Streamlit's declare_component, which is typical for custom components. The overall flow is straightforward and does not exhibit malicious patterns or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears safe and free from malicious behavior. It implements a standard image display and interaction feature for Streamlit, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
