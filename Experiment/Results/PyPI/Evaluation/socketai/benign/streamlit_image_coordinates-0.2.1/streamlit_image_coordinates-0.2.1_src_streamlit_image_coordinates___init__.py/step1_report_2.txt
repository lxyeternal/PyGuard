{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Streamlit component to display images and capture click coordinates, supporting various image sources and formats.",
  "sources": "Reads image data from file paths or URLs; loads images via the PIL library; accepts image data as numpy arrays or objects with a save method.",
  "sinks": "Outputs a base64-encoded image string used in a custom Streamlit component, and possibly logs click data returned from the component.",
  "flows": "Image data is read from source inputs, encoded in base64, and passed to the custom component; user interactions in the component send coordinate data back to the app.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code processes images securely and does not execute untrusted code. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code handles image sources safely by encoding image data to base64 for display, with proper format validation. It uses standard libraries (numpy, PIL, base64) and streamlit components without executing any untrusted code. The custom component is declared but not shown, and its implementation is assumed to be secure. No malicious behaviors such as network transmission of sensitive data, backdoors, or cryptomining activities are detected. The flow is straightforward: load image, encode, display, and capture clicks. The code does not include any suspicious or hidden operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an interactive image coordinate capture tool for Streamlit, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It handles image inputs securely and uses standard practices.",
