  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging 'python-redis-cache', reading README.md for description, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, static assignment of version, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sources involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, conventional setup script with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script performing static configuration for packaging. It reads a local README file, sets package metadata, dependencies, and version info. There are no dynamic operations, user inputs, network activity, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign with high confidence, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices support this conclusion. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present, and the scores are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and appropriate.",
