  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of XML utility functions used for traversal, comparison, and debugging. There is no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the potential for internal structure exposure, but it does not constitute a security threat. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0."
