{
  "purpose": "Provides diff, match, and patch functions for text comparison, diff computation, and patch application.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, regex matches, and string operations within the code.",
  "sinks": "Performs local string manipulations, encoding, and decoding; no external system or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows through diff computation, line-to-character conversions, and patch serialization/deserialization within the code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious external calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard diff-match-patch algorithms, with functions for diffing, matching, and patching texts. It uses regex for parsing patch formats and standard libraries for encoding. No external system calls, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The structure is clear, well-documented, and follows typical implementation patterns for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-known diff-match-patch implementation used for text processing. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are accurate and justified.",
