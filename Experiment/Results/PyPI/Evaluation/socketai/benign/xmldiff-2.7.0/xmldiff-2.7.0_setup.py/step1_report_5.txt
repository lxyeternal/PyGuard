  "purpose": "To set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or send data to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the setup() call is straightforward and does not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no unusual logic, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from setuptools and executes it with default parameters. There are no parameters provided to configure or customize the setup process. It appears to be a minimal, boilerplate setup script. No suspicious code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The absence of additional setup parameters or scripts reduces concern for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. It performs a standard package setup with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
