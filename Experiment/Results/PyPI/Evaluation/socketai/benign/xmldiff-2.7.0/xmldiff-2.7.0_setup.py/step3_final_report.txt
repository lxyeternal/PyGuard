  "purpose": "Minimal setup script importing 'setup' from setuptools and calling it with no arguments.",
  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools; call to setup() with no parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of configuration parameters; extremely minimal code, but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, minimal package setup script. It imports 'setup' and calls it without arguments, which is often used as a placeholder or starting point. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not process external input, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. The simplicity and lack of configuration make it benign. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. It is a minimal placeholder setup script. The scores should reflect this benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and security risk also at 0.",
