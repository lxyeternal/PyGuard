{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for representing XML diff actions such as node deletion, insertion, renaming, moving, attribute updates, and namespace modifications.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code only defines namedtuples.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code is static and does not process input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code merely declares data structures without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of namedtuple definitions used for XML diff operations. It is static, simple, and contains no executable or malicious components. The provided reports are empty, indicating no analysis or findings. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities. The absence of report content suggests either missing data or no issues detected. Based on the code and reports, the security risk and malware likelihood are minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious intent. The empty reports do not indicate any vulnerabilities or malicious activity. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
