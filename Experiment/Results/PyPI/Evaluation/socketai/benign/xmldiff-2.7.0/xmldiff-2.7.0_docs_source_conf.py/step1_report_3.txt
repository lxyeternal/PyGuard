{
  "purpose": "This is a configuration file for Sphinx documentation, used to set parameters for generating project documentation.",
  "sources": "Commented out import statements (`sys`, `os`) and the static files path (`html_static_path`). No active input sources for code execution or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no code executes untrusted input, writes data, or performs network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the file is purely declarative configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; all content is standard configuration syntax with no obfuscated code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The entire file is a static configuration script for Sphinx documentation. It contains only variable assignments, comments, and standard configuration options. No input handling, no data processing, no code execution or external communications. The commented import statements suggest potential extension points but are inactive. The static paths and options are safe. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Sphinx configuration file with no malicious behavior, no security threats, and no obfuscated or suspicious code. It solely defines documentation build parameters.",
