  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation build, defining extensions, paths, and output options.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments, comments, and list definitions within the configuration file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external data handling, or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; purely declarative assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; all code is static and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Sphinx configuration file with no executable logic, external data input, or network activity. It contains only variable assignments, comments, and lists defining documentation parameters. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or supply chain attack vectors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The code does not pose any security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration file with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening content. The scores of 0.0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate and accurate.",
