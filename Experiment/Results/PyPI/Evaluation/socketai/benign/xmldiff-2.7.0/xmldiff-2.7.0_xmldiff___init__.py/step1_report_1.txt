  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided or clear from the given content.",
  "sources": "The code does not explicitly read input, environment variables, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data leakage might occur.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from sources to sinks due to absence of input handling or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is empty; no logic, functions, or data handling is present. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment contains no executable code, data handling, or logic. As a result, there are no source, sink, or flow patterns. The absence of code makes it impossible to identify malicious behavior or security risks. This likely indicates an empty or placeholder script with no suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is empty or non-functional, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. There is no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent. Overall security risk is negligible, and confidence is high that this code poses no threat.",
