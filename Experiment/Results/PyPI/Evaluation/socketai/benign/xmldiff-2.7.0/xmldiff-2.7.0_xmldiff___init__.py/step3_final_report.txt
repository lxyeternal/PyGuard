  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data read from code files, environment variables, network connections, and module imports.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through network transmission, file writing, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "From data sources such as input functions or environment variables to sinks like network sockets or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, minimal or empty scripts, lack of comments, or unclear purpose; potential obfuscation or incomplete code.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify code presence or absence, with scores reflecting the lack of malicious indicators. When code is minimal or unclear, risk scores are cautiously elevated to 0.2-0.3, justified by uncertainty. Malware and obfuscation scores are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of suspicious patterns. The reasoning is cautious yet appropriate, with minor overestimations in risk scores in some ambiguous cases. Overall, the assessments are accurate and well-founded.",
  "conclusion": "All reports accurately evaluate the code's benign nature, with appropriate low malware and obfuscation scores. Slightly elevated risk scores in uncertain cases are justified. No significant issues or malicious activity are detected, and the scoring is consistent with the analysis.",
