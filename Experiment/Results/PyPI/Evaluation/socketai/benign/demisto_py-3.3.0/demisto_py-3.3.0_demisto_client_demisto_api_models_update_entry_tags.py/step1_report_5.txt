  "purpose": "Defines a data model for updating entry tags via a REST API in a security incident management system.",
  "sources": "None; this code does not read external input directly.",
  "sinks": "None; this code does not perform data output or external calls.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only class and property definitions, no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with attributes for 'id', 'investigation_id', 'tags', and 'version'. It includes getter/setter methods and serialization functions. There are no external data reads, no network calls, and no execution of untrusted data. The class appears to be a plain data container used for API interactions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The only potential concern could be misuse of this model if the data it holds is not properly validated elsewhere, but that is outside the scope of this code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data model for API communication, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
