{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for updating entry tags via a REST API, including serialization methods.",
  "sources": "Input data for class instantiation (id, investigation_id, tags, version).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; code does not write data externally or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters to internal attributes, then through to_dict() for serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward data model with properties, getters, setters, and serialization methods. It appears auto-generated from a Swagger specification, which is common for API client models. No network activity, cryptographic operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is evident. The class is used to structure data for API requests, with no evidence of malicious payloads or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API data model class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves its purpose of data encapsulation and serialization without introducing vulnerabilities.",
