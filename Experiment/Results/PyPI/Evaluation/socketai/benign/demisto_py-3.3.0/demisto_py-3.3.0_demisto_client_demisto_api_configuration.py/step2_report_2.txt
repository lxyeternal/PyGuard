  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code is for configuration setup, with no external data reading.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No actual data flow or request execution, only configuration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes it's standard auto-generated code with no malicious intent, confidence at 1.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, with emphasis on potential exposure via logging.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that sensitive data could flow into headers or logs if misconfigured.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, just configuration management.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states benign SDK setup, with low security risk if secrets are mismanaged externally.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — acceptable, given potential misconfiguration risks.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity detected; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar overview.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted input flow; only internal attribute usage.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of backdoors or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies this as standard configuration code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external untrusted input; configuration attributes are internal.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Properly states this is benign configuration code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Notes that sensitive data could be exposed via logs or debug reports.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states this is standard configuration code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward, auto-generated code.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code. Minor concerns about potential misconfiguration or exposure via logging are acknowledged but do not elevate the risk significantly.\n\n### Final personal estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 — minimal, mostly related to misconfiguration or logging exposure, not malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately score the code. The code appears to be standard SDK configuration code, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors. The scores reflect this well.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores; no changes needed.",
