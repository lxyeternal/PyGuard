  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the issues, scores, and conclusions are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Configuration class for API client setup.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is a standard auto-generated SDK configuration class. No signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident. The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** SDK configuration for Demisto API.\n- **Findings:** Potential exposure of sensitive data via logging, but no malicious code.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nWhile the code handles sensitive data, it does so in a standard manner. The potential security risk stems from misconfiguration (e.g., logging secrets), but there's no malicious intent. The security risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable given the possibility of accidental data leaks if logs are misused.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** SDK configuration class.\n- **Findings:** Similar to above; no malicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, this is standard configuration code. The minimal security risk score is justified, considering potential misconfiguration but no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** SDK configuration class.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, but potential exposure via `to_debug_report`.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is straightforward, with no malicious activity. The `to_debug_report` could leak sensitive info if misused, but this is typical for debug functions and not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** SDK configuration class.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, manages various connection settings.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, standard configuration code with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 - 0.2), justified by potential misconfiguration or logging exposure, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential for accidental data leaks through logging or misconfiguration, I would assign a slightly higher but still low risk score overall, perhaps around **0.1** to **0.2** for the entire code, which aligns with the current assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are thorough and accurate. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature. No modifications are necessary.",
