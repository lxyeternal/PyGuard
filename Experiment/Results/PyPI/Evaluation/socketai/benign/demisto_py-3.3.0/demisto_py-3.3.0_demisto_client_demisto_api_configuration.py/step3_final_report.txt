  "purpose": "Configuration class for API client setup, managing authentication, logging, SSL, and connection pooling.",
  "sources": "Attributes such as api_key, username, password, environment variables, and configuration parameters used in headers and logging.",
  "sinks": "Headers for API requests, logging outputs, debug reports, and internal attribute usage.",
  "flows": "Attributes used to generate headers and logs; no external untrusted input flows directly into network requests or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. Standard auto-generated SDK code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK configuration class with no network activity, no code injection, and no obfuscation. Sensitive data is stored in attributes but not transmitted insecurely. No signs of malicious backdoors or sabotage. The potential security concern is exposure of secrets via logs or debug reports, but this is typical for SDKs and not malicious. The code's structure and content are benign, with no anomalies indicating sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated SDK configuration class with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and primarily related to secret management outside this code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1-0.2). No modifications are necessary.",
