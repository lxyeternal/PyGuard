{
  "purpose": "This code imports a default API class from a specified package, likely to interact with an API endpoint related to 'demisto_client'.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'demisto_client.demisto_api.api.default_api' indicates data or command flow from external library/package into the application.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in the provided code snippet; it is only an import statement.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing 'DefaultApi' for use elsewhere in the application; no runtime data flow or untrusted input handling is shown here.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward, importing a known module.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a future import and a single import statement. The import is from a known package structure, indicating the setup for API interactions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious code activity. The minimal code does not include any execution, data handling, or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, legitimate application setup.",
