  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple import statement:\n     ```python\n     from __future__ import absolute_import\n     from demisto_client.demisto_api.api.default_api import DefaultApi\n     ```\n   - No runtime logic, data processing, network communication, or data sinks are present.\n   - The code is standard for setting up an API client library, not executing any actions or data flows.\n\n2. **Potential for Malicious Activity:**\n   - The code only imports a class from an external package; there are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The `__future__` import and `flake8: noqa` comment are common in Python projects for compatibility and linting purposes.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, environment variables, or dynamic code execution is evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, no obfuscation detected.\n   - **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity is indicated.\n   - **Security risk score (0):** Appropriate, as the code is benign.\n   - The reports consistently assign high confidence (1) and zero for anomalies, malware, and security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n4. **Critical Evaluation:**\n   - Since all reports agree on the benign nature, and the code is a straightforward import, there is no reason to adjust the scores.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified here; the code is simply a setup import.\n\n5. **Final Assessment:**\n   - The code snippet is benign.\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** This code is a harmless import statement with no security concerns.",
