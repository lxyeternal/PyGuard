  "purpose": "The code imports a default API class from a Python client library for interacting with the Demisto API.",
  "sources": "Import statement from demisto_client.demisto_api.api.default_api",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs in this code",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports a class without executing logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a future import statement and an import of a class from a third-party library. There are no functions, data processing, or network operations. The import is straightforward and typical for a client library setup. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement for a Python API client library with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
