  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports describe a simple import statement:\n     ```python\n     from __future__ import absolute_import\n     from demisto_client.demisto_api.api.default_api import DefaultApi\n     ```\n   - No additional code, data handling, network activity, or runtime execution is present.\n   - The code is standard for setting up an API client in Python, importing a class from a third-party library.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Activity or Anomalies:**\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected.\n   - The import statements are straightforward, with no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n   - The reports correctly identify that this is benign setup code.\n\n3. **Potential Risks & Scores:**\n   - Given the simplicity and benign nature, the malware score should be 0.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score should be 0, as there's no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities in this fragment.\n\n4. **Reasoning about the risk score:**\n   - The current scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - No reason to increase the risk score since the code does not perform any harmful actions.\n\n5. **Consistency & Justification:**\n   - The reports are consistent, all indicating benign, straightforward import statements.\n   - The confidence level is 1, which is appropriate given the clarity and simplicity.\n   - The absence of any suspicious activity justifies the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores being 0.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type        | Recommended Value | Justification                                                                                     |\n|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score     | 0                   | No malicious behavior detected; import is standard and benign.                                |\n| Obfuscated Score  | 0                   | No obfuscation present; code is straightforward.                                                 |\n| Risk Score        | 0                   | No security risks or vulnerabilities evident in this code fragment.                            |\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a simple, benign import statement from a third-party API client library.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The current scoring aligns with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Final note:** The overall assessment confirms this code fragment is safe and poses no security threat.",
