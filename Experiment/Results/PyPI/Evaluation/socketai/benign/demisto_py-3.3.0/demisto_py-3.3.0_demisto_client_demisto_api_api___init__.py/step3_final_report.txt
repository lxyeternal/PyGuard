  "purpose": "The code imports a class from a third-party API client library, serving as setup code for API interactions.",
  "sources": "The import statement sourcing 'DefaultApi' from 'demisto_client.demisto_api.api.default_api'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only performs a static import with no runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with standard import statements, no obfuscation, no dynamic code, and no secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing 'DefaultApi' from a third-party library. It contains no malicious code, no data handling, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The presence of '__future__' import and 'flake8' comment are standard practices. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all correctly set to 0, reflecting the benign nature. The confidence score is 1, as the code is clear and straightforward. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
