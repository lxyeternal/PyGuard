  "purpose": "This code imports a default API class from the 'demisto_client' package, likely for interacting with an external API.",
  "sources": "Import statement from an external package 'demisto_client.demisto_api.api.default_api'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a future import statement and a flake8 directive, which are standard in Python projects. No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports a class from an external library, which is a common practice. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The presence of 'absolute_import' ensures compatibility and clarity in module imports. The 'flake8: noqa' comment disables linting for style checks but does not introduce security issues. Overall, the code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project setup and does not contain any suspicious behavior.",
