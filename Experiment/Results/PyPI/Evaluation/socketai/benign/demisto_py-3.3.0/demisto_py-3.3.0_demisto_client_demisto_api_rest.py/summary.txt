  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-driven REST API client with no signs of malware, sabotage, or obfuscation. The only security consideration is the optional detailed logging controlled via environment variables, which could expose sensitive data if misused. This is a feature, not malicious behavior. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
