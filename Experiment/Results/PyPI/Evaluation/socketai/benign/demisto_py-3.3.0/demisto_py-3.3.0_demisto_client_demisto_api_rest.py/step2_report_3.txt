  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard REST API client implementation using urllib3, with SSL, proxy, and request/response handling.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.\n- Environment variables control logging verbosity, which could leak sensitive info if misconfigured, but this is a feature, not malicious.\n- No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- The code does not perform any data exfiltration or malicious network activity.\n- The request construction and error handling are typical for such clients.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Validates the code is a REST API client for Demisto.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, low security risk, potential info leak via logging if misconfigured.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The low risk score is appropriate given the minimal concern about misconfiguration.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, standard API client.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, environment variable for logging could leak info.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The very low risk score reflects the benign nature.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. Slightly higher risk due to potential info leaks, but overall still low.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same purpose.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, standard SSL/proxy handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- **Malware score:** All zero, consistent with the analysis. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the potential for info leaks via environment variable-controlled logging but no actual malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correct at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential info leak via environment variable, a slightly higher risk score (e.g., 0.2) is justified, but not higher.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a legitimate, standard REST API client with no malicious or sabotage behavior. The only minor concern is the optional detailed logging controlled by an environment variable, which could leak sensitive info if misused. This is a known and manageable risk, not malware or sabotage.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Final note:** No evidence suggests any supply chain compromise or malicious intent. The code appears safe, purpose-driven, and aligned with standard practices.",
