{
  "purpose": "Define a data model class 'OutputType' for API responses, providing methods for serialization and comparison.",
  "sources": "Class constructor (__init__), to_dict method, and attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data processing or external outputs; mainly internal data handling and serialization.",
  "flows": "Initialization of object -> conversion to dictionary via to_dict -> string representation via to_str.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; the class appears to be a standard auto-generated data model with no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical auto-generated Swagger model class. It defines an empty attribute map and types, with methods for converting object data to dictionary and string formats, as well as comparison operators. No external data inputs, command execution, or network activity is present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious data handling are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated data model with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides serialization and comparison methods for a data structure.",
