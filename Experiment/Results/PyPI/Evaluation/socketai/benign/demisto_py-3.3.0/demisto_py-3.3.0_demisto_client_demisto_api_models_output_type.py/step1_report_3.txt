  "purpose": "Define a data model class 'OutputType' for Swagger-generated API client, primarily for serializing and deserializing API data.",
  "sources": "Class constructor (__init__), to_dict method, attribute accessors, and internal properties.",
  "sinks": "Serialization methods (to_dict, to_str) that convert object properties to dictionaries or strings.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes through serialization methods for output or API communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network connections, and no unusual code patterns. The class is a standard data model with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple Python class representing a data model with serialization capabilities. It contains methods for converting its attributes to dictionaries and strings, as well as equality comparisons. There are no network calls, input/output operations, or code injection mechanisms. The 'six' library is used for compatibility. The class is straightforward, auto-generated, and designed for API data handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, auto-generated data model class with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It solely provides data serialization functionalities for API interaction.",
