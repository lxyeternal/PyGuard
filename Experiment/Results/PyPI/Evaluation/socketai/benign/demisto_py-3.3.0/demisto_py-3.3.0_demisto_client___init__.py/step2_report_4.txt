  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose:** API configuration and login handling for Demisto (Cortex XSOAR).  \n- **Sources:** Environment variables, response headers, function parameters.  \n- **Sinks:** Cookies, environment variables, request bodies.  \n- **Flow:** Standard configuration retrieval → HTTP login requests → token extraction → API client setup.  \n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, standard regex for headers, typical login flow.  \n- **Analysis:** The code performs standard API client setup, login with cookie and CSRF token handling, and request abstraction. No signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate client library, no malware or sabotage.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 (low), Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose:** Configuration and utility functions for Demisto API, including setup, login, version-specific URL handling.  \n- **Sources:** Environment variables, function parameters, response headers.  \n- **Sinks:** API keys, tokens, session cookies, API requests.  \n- **Flow:** Configuration from env/params → login requests → session tokens → API requests.  \n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, straightforward handling, potential risk if env variables are compromised, but no malicious code.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard API client code, handles tokens securely, no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Typical API client, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for Demisto API, including authentication, request handling, version-based URL retrieval.  \n- **Sources:** Environment variables, function inputs.  \n- **Sinks:** API calls, session tokens, request bodies.  \n- **Flow:** Configuration → login → session token management → API requests.  \n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, standard session handling, URL adjustment based on server version.  \n- **Analysis:** Legitimate client code, no malicious patterns, proper token/session management.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard API client, no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for Demisto API, configuration, request handling.  \n- **Sources:** Environment variables, function parameters.  \n- **Sinks:** API requests, headers, cookies.  \n- **Flow:** Configuration setup → API request execution.  \n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, standard handling, potential exposure if env variables are mishandled, but no malicious code.  \n- **Analysis:** Proper API client setup, session token management, no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Conclusion:** Typical, secure API client code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose:** Configuration and interaction with Demisto API, including setup, authentication, requests.  \n- **Sources:** Environment variables, function parameters.  \n- **Sinks:** API requests, headers, cookies.  \n- **Flow:** Configuration → login → session token handling → API requests.  \n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, standard handling, sensitive data via env vars.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard API client code, no malicious activity or sabotage.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure client code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2, Confidence 0.9.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, all reports describe standard API client configuration, login, and request handling routines.  \n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes:** None evident; environment variable handling, session management, and URL selection are appropriate.  \n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with their analysis. Risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minor configuration or exposure concerns but no actual malicious activity.  \n- **Malware justification:** None of the code snippets exhibit malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of environment variables for secrets is standard but should be handled carefully outside this code.  \n- **Assumption-based vulnerabilities:** No, the reports do not make unsupported claims. They correctly identify the code as typical for API clients.  \n- **Score consistency:** The scores are consistent with the analysis and code behavior.\n\n### Overall Final Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward, no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — minor concerns about environment variable handling, but overall low risk.\n\n**In conclusion,** this code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client for Demisto/Cortex XSOAR, with no malicious or sabotage features detected. The low risk score is appropriate given the environment-variable reliance, which is standard practice but warrants secure handling outside the code.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the risk score at 0.2, malware and obfuscated scores at 0.",
