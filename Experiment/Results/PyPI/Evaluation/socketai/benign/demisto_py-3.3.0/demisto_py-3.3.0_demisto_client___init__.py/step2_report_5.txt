  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided details.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate client library for Demisto/Cortex XSOAR API. It retrieves configuration from environment variables, performs login with cookie and CSRF token handling, and provides a generic request function. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The logic is standard for API clients. The handling of environment variables, cookies, tokens, and URL versioning is typical. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (low, given the context of environment variable handling and login procedures)\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. The confidence is high (0.9), and no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing configuration via environment variables, session token management, and version-based URL selection. No malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's flow is standard, with session management via cookies and tokens, and API request abstraction. No suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on configuration, login, session tokens, and request handling. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's approach is typical for API clients. It handles tokens, cookies, and version-specific URLs securely and appropriately.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights configuration, session management, and request handling. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code manages environment variables, tokens, and API requests securely, following standard practices.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing configuration, request handling, and session management, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's logic is standard, with proper handling of sensitive data via environment variables and session tokens.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code appears to be a legitimate, standard API client implementation for Demisto/XSOAR, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws:** The environment variable handling and session management are appropriate. No logical flaws or security issues are evident.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** All malware scores are correctly set to 0, as no malicious activity is detected. Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code clarity. The risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting typical configuration and login procedures, which are not inherently risky but depend on environment security.\n\n- **Potential Risks:** The only concern is reliance on environment variables for sensitive data, which is standard but requires secure environment management outside this code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (appropriate for configuration code handling sensitive data, but not inherently risky)\n\n**Summary:** The reports accurately reflect the code's nature. No malicious or obfuscated activity is present. The scores are reasonable and justified. The overall security posture of this code is benign, serving as a typical API client library.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure environment variables containing secrets are securely managed outside of the codebase to prevent leaks.",
