{
  "purpose": "Provides configuration, login, and request functions for interacting with Demisto (Cortex XSOAR) API, handling environment variables, session tokens, and version-specific URL adjustments.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., DEMISTO_BASE_URL, DEMISTO_API_KEY, DEMISTO_HTTP_HEADERS), response headers (cookies, set-cookie), function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Cookies, session tokens, API request headers, environment variables for credentials.",
  "flows": "Configuration retrieval from env/params → login HTTP requests → cookie and token extraction → API request execution.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, standard regex for headers, typical login flow, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client setup for Demisto/Cortex XSOAR, performing configuration via environment variables, managing session cookies and CSRF tokens through multiple HTTP requests, and providing a generic request function. It handles version-specific URL adjustments based on server response. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The environment variables are used for sensitive data, which is common but should be securely managed outside this code. The logic and structure follow best practices for API clients, with proper token/session management and request abstraction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for Demisto/Cortex XSOAR, with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with its functionality: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, low security risk score 0.2 due to environment variable handling. Overall, it presents a low-risk, standard configuration and login utility.",
