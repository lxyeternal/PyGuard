  "purpose": "Static import statements for Demisto SDK models and API components, serving as setup code for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'demisto_client.demisto_api' package, including models and API classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; static code with no runtime data handling or external data input.",
  "flows": "None; purely static import statements with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated SDK boilerplate, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and descriptive comments. It lacks executable logic, network calls, or data processing. The extensive imports suggest auto-generated SDK setup code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is to facilitate API interactions, not to perform any runtime operations. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0 are appropriate and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static SDK setup code with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores accurately reflect its safe nature. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
