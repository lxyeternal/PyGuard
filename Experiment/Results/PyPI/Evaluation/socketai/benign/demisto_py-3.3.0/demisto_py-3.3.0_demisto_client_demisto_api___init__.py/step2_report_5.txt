  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as primarily consisting of static import statements for models and API classes related to the Demisto SDK.\n- The code contains extensive comments and documentation, typical of auto-generated SDK modules.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing is evident.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are reported or apparent.\n- The code does not perform any operations, only imports, which are benign.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code appears to be boilerplate or auto-generated SDK setup code.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.\n- The malware score is consistently reported as 0, aligning with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the static nature of the code.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The risk scores are 0, justified by the benign, static import-only nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only notable aspect is the large number of import statements, which is unusual but not malicious—likely auto-generated.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The code is safe, with no security risks or malware indications.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (benign static imports, no vulnerabilities)\n\nThis code is a standard, auto-generated SDK setup module with no malicious or security-compromising elements.",
