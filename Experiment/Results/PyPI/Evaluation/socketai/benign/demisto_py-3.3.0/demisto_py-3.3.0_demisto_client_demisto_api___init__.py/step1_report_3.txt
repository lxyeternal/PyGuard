{
  "purpose": "The code primarily sets up import statements for a Python SDK interacting with Demisto's REST API, including importing models, API clients, and configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from imported modules, especially models and configuration classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or output directly within this code.",
  "flows": "The code flows involve importing modules and models; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. The code is straightforward, mainly imports and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a descriptive docstring. It imports various modules related to the Demisto API SDK. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated logic, or malicious constructs are detected. The initial comment block describes API usage, versioning, and examples, which are standard documentation practices. There are no signs of malware or security risks based on the visible code. The lack of any runtime logic or external data handling further reduces suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK setup with imports and documentation, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be an auto-generated or template-like SDK import module with no malicious intent.",
