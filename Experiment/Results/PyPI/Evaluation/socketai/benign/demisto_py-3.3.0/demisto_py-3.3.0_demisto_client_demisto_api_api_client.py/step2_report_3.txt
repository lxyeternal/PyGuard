  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the described code behavior with the provided source code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correctly describes a standard auto-generated Swagger API client, reading environment variables, files, and constructing headers.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious activity detected. Use of secure nonce and hashing for authorization is standard. File handling via temporary files and regex for filename extraction are routine.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attack evident. Risk is low.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (low, appropriate).\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard API client behavior.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Use of nonce and sha256 hashing is typical for secure API requests.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, supply chain attack, or sabotage.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate, consistent, and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Same general description.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Highlights the use of secrets.choice for nonce, sha256 for signing, and dynamic header creation. All are standard security practices. No code injection or malicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Describes the code as a Swagger client handling serialization, request building, and environment variables.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns. Use of secrets for nonce and sha256 for hashing is standard.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious or sabotage behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar description, emphasizing request construction and response handling.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of secrets for nonce, dynamic header creation, and temporary file handling are routine. No malicious patterns or backdoors.  \n- **Conclusion:** Very low risk, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is a standard auto-generated Swagger API client, with no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or sabotage.  \n- **Malware score justification:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code's behavior. No evidence of malicious activity, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports indicate no obfuscation, which is accurate given the code's clarity.  \n- **Risk score:** The overall risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.  \n- The code is a typical, auto-generated SDK with standard security measures.  \n- No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)  \n\n**Rationale:** The code handles secure API requests, uses nonce and hashing appropriately, reads from environment variables and files, and deserializes responses safely. No signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code appears safe. The scores are justified and aligned with the source code's behavior. No further action required.",
