  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling string conversions, Thrift attribute extraction, and byte string manipulation within HappyBase.",
  "sources": "Input data originates from function parameters such as 'name', 'obj_or_cls', and 'str_or_bytes'. No external data sources or user input reads are present.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed internally; no external sinks like network connections, file writes, or system commands are used.",
  "flows": "Transformations occur within functions: string conversions and byte manipulations, with no external data flows or untrusted data propagation to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscation or unusual code behaviors. Use of dynamic features is minimal and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for string and byte handling, such as converting camel case to PEP8, Thrift attribute extraction, and byte string incrementation. It includes compatibility code for older Python versions and handles data type conversions securely. No external network, file, or system commands are invoked. No malicious or suspicious behaviors identified. The functions operate on provided inputs without side effects or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of utility functions intended for internal data handling within HappyBase. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation appears safe, straightforward, and compatible across Python versions.",
