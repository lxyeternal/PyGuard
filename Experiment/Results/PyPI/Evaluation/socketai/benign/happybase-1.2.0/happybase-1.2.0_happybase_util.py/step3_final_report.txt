  "purpose": "Utility functions for string case conversions, Thrift attribute handling, byte manipulations, and compatibility support within the HappyBase library.",
  "sources": "None; functions operate on input parameters, regex patterns, or class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or untrusted data handling beyond internal processing.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through conversion functions; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard library usage and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for string case conversions, Thrift attribute extraction, byte string incrementation, and compatibility fallback for OrderedDict. It performs safe operations, with no external data handling, network activity, or system modifications. The fallback for OrderedDict raises an error if unavailable, which is standard. Byte manipulation functions are safe and do not perform any malicious actions. The regex-based string conversions are benign. Overall, the code is clear, well-structured, and free of malicious or security-compromising elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0, which are appropriate given the code's nature.",
