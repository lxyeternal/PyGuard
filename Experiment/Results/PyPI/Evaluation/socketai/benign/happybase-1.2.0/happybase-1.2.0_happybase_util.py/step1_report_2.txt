  "purpose": "Utility functions for string manipulation, Thrift data handling, and byte operations within the HappyBase library.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (re, six), regex pattern, and standard libraries. Functions operate on input parameters such as strings, objects, and byte strings.",
  "sinks": "The code processes data but does not write or transmit untrusted data externally; no external network or file system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (strings, objects) flow through conversion functions without external influence. No data flows to insecure sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides string conversion utilities, Thrift attribute extraction, and byte manipulation. It safely handles types, performs conversions, and increments byte strings for sorting. No external network access, data leakage, or suspicious behaviors are present. The only potential concern is type checking and conversion routines, but they are standard and safe. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module focused on data manipulation and type conversions. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified based on the provided code.",
