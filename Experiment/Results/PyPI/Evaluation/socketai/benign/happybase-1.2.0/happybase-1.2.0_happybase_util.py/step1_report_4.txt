  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling string conversions, Thrift attribute extraction, and byte manipulation in HappyBase.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read untrusted input directly; code relies on external inputs to be passed as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions perform data leaks, network communication, or execute untrusted data as code.",
  "flows": "N/A - no source-to-sink data flows that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed; functions perform standard data manipulation and conversion tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for string conversions (camel case to PEP8 and vice versa), Thrift attribute handling, and byte string manipulation. It includes safe handling of binary and text data, with no operations that process external inputs directly or perform dangerous actions such as executing code, network access, or handling secrets. The only complex operation is bytes_increment, which safely increments a byte sequence for sorting. The import fallback for OrderedDict is standard and includes error handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs safe data conversions and handling routines without any suspicious operations.",
