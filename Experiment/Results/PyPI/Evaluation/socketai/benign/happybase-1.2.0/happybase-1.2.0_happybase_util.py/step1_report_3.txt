  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling string conversions, Thrift data, and byte manipulations in HappyBase.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (re, six, collections, ordereddict), no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling points; functions process data but do not interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "Function inputs are processed locally; no external data flow or untrusted source-to-sink paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code uses standard libraries and typical utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for string conversion and data handling, including safe encoding, byte manipulation, and Thrift attribute processing. It includes fallback mechanisms for ordered dictionary import, which is benign. No external data input or network interaction is present. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard data processing tasks typical of utility functions, with no suspicious activity.",
