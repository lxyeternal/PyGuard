      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard batch mutation handler for HBase, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The low security risk scores in previous reports are justified by the external API interactions, but overall, the code is safe and does not pose any security threat."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration snippet with a known pattern for dynamic version loading. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The main security concern is the use of exec() on an external file, which could be exploited if the file is compromised. The current scores are appropriate, but the risk score could be marginally increased to better reflect the potential for malicious code execution if the version file is tampered with."
