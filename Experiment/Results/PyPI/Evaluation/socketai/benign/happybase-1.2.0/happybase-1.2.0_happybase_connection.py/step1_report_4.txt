  "purpose": "This module provides a Python class for managing connections and operations with an HBase Thrift server, including table creation, deletion, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters, connection setup data, table names, method inputs for table operations, and potentially untrusted input via method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Network communication via Thrift socket, method calls to HBase server, and potential data serialization/deserialization.",
  "flows": "Input parameters for connection and table management flow through methods to the underlying Thrift client, resulting in network calls to the HBase server.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are observed. No obfuscated code features are present. Usage of standard libraries and conventions consistent with a typical HBase client.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard connection and table management interface for HBase via Thrift, utilizing well-known libraries. No suspicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms are detected. All data flows are confined to legitimate configuration, connection, and table management functions. The code does not handle or store sensitive information insecurely. No malicious or suspicious code constructs are present. The code's purpose appears to be legitimate management of HBase tables with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical HBase Thrift client wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected operations for managing HBase tables and connections. No malware or security threats are identified.",
