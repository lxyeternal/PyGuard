  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard HBase client wrapper, with no suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscated code. It handles data securely, with proper validation and no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the assessment.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high confidence given the thoroughness.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's scoring appears reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a typical HBase client implementation with standard data access patterns. No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — slightly above zero, possibly reflecting minimal inherent risks in networked database code, but still low.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Conclusion:** The scoring is consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Also a standard HBase client wrapper, with no signs of malicious activity. Proper resource handling, input validation, and no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—standard implementation, no malicious indicators, well-structured, with proper validation and resource management.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, reflecting minimal inherent risk.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n- **Conclusion:** The scoring aligns with the report.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a typical HBase API wrapper, with no suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. Proper resource cleanup and validation are observed.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — consistent with previous low-risk assessments.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis indicating no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0, 0.1, 0.2), reflecting the low inherent risk of database client code, which is acceptable and justified.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, considering the code interacts with external systems but is standard and well-structured.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, well-justified, and reflect a benign, standard implementation of an HBase client wrapper. No security issues, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
