{
  "purpose": "This code implements a client wrapper for interacting with HBase tables via Thrift, providing methods for data retrieval, insertion, deletion, and scanning.",
  "sources": "API calls to the HBase Thrift client (e.g., getRowWithColumns, getVer, scannerOpen, scannerGetList, etc.), reading configuration and connection parameters.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from HBase, external network communication with HBase server, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (row keys, columns, timestamps) flow into Thrift API calls; responses are processed into Python data structures and returned to callers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of struct for counters is standard. No external data exfiltration or malicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured client wrapper for HBase, with input validation, resource management, and logging. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The data flows are typical for database access layers. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, which interacts with external systems but does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an HBase client wrapper with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score reflects the inherent network interaction but does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
