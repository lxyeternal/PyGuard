  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward static assignment of the string `'1.2.0'` to the `__version__` variable. There are no dynamic inputs, no data processing, no external calls, and no suspicious or obfuscated code. This pattern is standard in Python package version declarations.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:  \n   No report indicates any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies. The code does not contain any hidden behaviors, code injections, or external data handling.\n\n3. **Risk and Malware Scores**:  \n   All reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. The `securityRisk` scores are also 0, indicating no security concerns. The `obfuscated` scores are 0, confirming the code is not obfuscated.\n\n4. **Assessment of the Reports' Reasoning and Scores**:  \n   The reasoning in each report is consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as a benign, standard version declaration with no security implications.\n\n5. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Given the simplicity and benign nature, there's no justification for any risk, malware, or obfuscation scores higher than 0.5. The current scores are appropriate.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation**:  \n   The code snippet is a typical, harmless version declaration. There are no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score**: Should remain at **0**.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: Should remain at **0**.  \n- **Risk Score**: Should remain at **0**.\n\n**In conclusion**, the current assessment of the code as safe and benign is correct. The scores are appropriate, and no further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \n- The code is a simple static version string assignment.  \n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.  \n- Scores are accurate and justified.  \n- No changes needed.",
