  "purpose": "Define the package version for the HappyBase module for use in __init__.py and setup.py.",
  "sources": "The line setting __version__ with a string literal.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external output.",
  "flows": "None; the version string is static and assigned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version assignment without dynamic or external input.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment and a static assignment of the version string '__version__ = '1.2.0''. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external calls, and no suspicious patterns. It serves as a simple version identifier, common in Python packages. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely defining a static version string with no malicious intent or security issues.",
