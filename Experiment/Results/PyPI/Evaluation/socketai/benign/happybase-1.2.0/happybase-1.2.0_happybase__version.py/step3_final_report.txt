  "sources": "Static assignment of the string '1.2.0' to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; static version declaration with no external data flow.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a simple static assignment with no obfuscation or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to __version__, a common practice for version declaration. It contains no external calls, input handling, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no security concerns. All assessments are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
