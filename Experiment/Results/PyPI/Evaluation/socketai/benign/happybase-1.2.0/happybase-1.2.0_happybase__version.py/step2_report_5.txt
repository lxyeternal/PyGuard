  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nAll reports describe the code as a straightforward assignment of a static string `'1.2.0'` to the `__version__` variable. The code is minimal, with no input handling, data processing, or external interactions. This is typical for package version modules.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**  \nNo report indicates any suspicious behavior, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or external data handling. The code is consistent across all reports, and all assessments agree that it's benign.\n\n3. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**  \nNo logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident. The reports correctly identify that this is standard version declaration code with no security concerns.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, aligning with the benign assessment.\n\n5. **Potential for Misinterpretation or Hidden Risks**  \nGiven the simplicity of the code, there is no basis for assigning any higher risk scores. The code does not process untrusted input, does not perform any external calls, and contains no obfuscation.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency & Validity**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as a benign, standard version declaration.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string, a common practice in Python packages. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high confidence ratings are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
