  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content**: The code is a straightforward assignment of the string `'1.2.0'` to the variable `__version__`. It contains no dynamic behavior, no input handling, no external calls, and no obfuscation.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**: All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. There are no data flows, no external dependencies, and no signs of obfuscation or malware.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Reports**:  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.  \n   - They correctly state that this is standard practice for defining package versions and that no security concerns are present.\n\n4. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.  \n   - The obfuscated score is 0, aligning with the absence of obfuscation or hidden behavior.  \n   - The security risk score is 0, which is correct.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**:  \n   - There are no assumptions about vulnerabilities; the code is static and safe.  \n   - No suspicious behaviors are implied or suggested.\n\n6. **Consistency and Justification**:  \n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's content.  \n   - The high confidence levels (mostly 1) are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk associated with static version declaration)\n\n**My own estimate** matches the reports: the code is benign, standard, and contains no security issues.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \n- No changes needed to the scores.  \n- The code is safe, and the reports correctly reflect its benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThis is a typical, harmless version declaration snippet with no security concerns.",
