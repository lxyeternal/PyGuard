  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a static string to the `__version__` variable. There are no signs of malicious code, dynamic behavior, or external data handling. The code is standard for package version declarations.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:  \nNo errors or flaws are identified in any of the reports. The logic is simple and correct for its purpose.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and benign nature. The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \nNo report suggests any reason to assign a risk score above 0.5. The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \nAll reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, which is justified since the code does not contain any malicious payloads or suspicious behaviors.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \nAll reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as a standard version declaration.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \nThe scores are consistent with the code's nature. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign and standard for package versioning.**  \nNo changes to the scores are necessary. The reports are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Note:\nWhile the current code is harmless, always ensure that in larger or more complex modules, dynamic versioning or external inputs are handled securely to prevent injection or other vulnerabilities. But in this isolated snippet, there are no concerns.",
