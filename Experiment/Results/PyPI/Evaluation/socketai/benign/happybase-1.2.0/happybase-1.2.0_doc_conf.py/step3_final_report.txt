  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on an external file for version assignment, which is a known security risk pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code reads the version information from a file and executes it dynamically, which is a common but potentially unsafe pattern if the file can be tampered with. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The risk stems from the possibility that an attacker could modify '_version.py' to include malicious code, which would then be executed during setup. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.45) are appropriate given the pattern, though the risk could be slightly increased to reflect the potential danger. The code itself is straightforward and benign in its current form, but the pattern warrants caution. Safer alternatives include importing the version as a module or reading the version string directly without executing code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration snippet with a known pattern for dynamic version loading. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The main security concern is the use of exec() on an external file, which could be exploited if the file is compromised. The current scores are appropriate, but the risk score could be marginally increased to better reflect the potential for malicious code execution if the version file is tampered with.",
