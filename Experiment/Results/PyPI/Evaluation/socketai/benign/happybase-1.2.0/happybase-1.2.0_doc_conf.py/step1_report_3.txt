  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building project documentation using Sphinx for the HappyBase project.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from '../happybase/_version.py' file; reads current file content for configuration setup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data is being processed or executed.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from file to assign to variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed; standard configuration file with no suspicious activities.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file for documentation, primarily importing modules, setting configuration variables, and reading version info from a specific file. It does not include any network operations, code execution, or handling of untrusted input. All operations are static and relate to documentation build setup. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration script for documentation generation and shows no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
