  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard batch mutation class for HBase, with no malicious indicators. It uses external client calls (`mutateRows`, `mutateRowsTs`) for data transmission, which are typical for such libraries.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, consistent, and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a typical implementation of batch mutations for HBase, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware suspected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — standard data handling, no vulnerabilities.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code appears to be a standard batch mutation handler. Slightly more cautious with a securityRisk score of 0.2, but no evidence of actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — perhaps reflecting minimal concern over external data transmission, but this is standard for such code.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation. The small risk score may be an over-cautious default.\n- **Conclusion:** The scoring seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard batch mutation logic, with a low security risk.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, perhaps reflecting the external client calls, but these are expected.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Also a straightforward batch mutation class with no malicious signs.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — standard for such code, given the external data transmission.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports agree the code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.\n- **Malware suspicion:** Zero across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** Zero, code is clear.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1–0.2), reflecting the external data transmission, but these are typical for such modules and do not indicate vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final thoughts:\n\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No evidence suggests malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- The risk scores are slightly conservative but reasonable, considering the external API calls.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — considering the external communication points, but these are standard and not inherently risky.\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, with no security concerns beyond typical external API interactions.**",
