{
  "purpose": "To provide a Python library for interacting with Apache HBase, including loading thrift definitions and importing core classes and constants.",
  "sources": "Reading the resource filename for the thrift file using _pkg_resources.resource_filename.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink that would process untrusted data; standard class and constant imports pose no risk.",
  "flows": "Resource filename is loaded from package resources, then classes and constants are imported; no flow of untrusted data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard package resource loading and imports appear normal.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a Thrift interface definition file from the package resources directory, which is a common and legitimate practice for defining service interfaces in Python. It then imports version info and core classes for database connection and table handling. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious data flow, or suspicious logic. The approach is consistent with a standard SDK setup for a database client library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup for a Python client library for HBase, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily loads a Thrift definition and imports core modules. No suspicious behavior or malware is detected.",
