  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign in isolation, with no active malicious behavior detected. The primary concerns are the trustworthiness of the 'yeref' package and the use of wildcard imports, which could conceal malicious functions if present. Overall, the security risk is very low, but further investigation into the package contents is recommended before deployment or execution in security-sensitive environments."
