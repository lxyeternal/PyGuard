{
  "purpose": "Minimal import statements from the 'yeref' package, likely for dependency inclusion or module access.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'yeref.yeref' and 'yeref.l_' modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, function calls, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static import statements without execution or data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') in some reports, which can conceal malicious functions; package name 'yeref' is non-standard and obscure.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, which by themselves are benign. The package 'yeref' is not a recognized standard library, raising suspicion about its origin. Wildcard imports ('*') are discouraged as they can hide malicious functions or code. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code is present. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0—are appropriate. The risk scores are slightly elevated (0.2-0.3) mainly due to the package's obscurity and import style, but without further context or code, these remain low. Confidence levels are reasonable, reflecting the minimal code and lack of active malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign in isolation, with no active malicious behavior detected. The primary concerns are the trustworthiness of the 'yeref' package and the use of wildcard imports, which could conceal malicious functions if present. Overall, the security risk is very low, but further investigation into the package contents is recommended before deployment or execution in security-sensitive environments.",
