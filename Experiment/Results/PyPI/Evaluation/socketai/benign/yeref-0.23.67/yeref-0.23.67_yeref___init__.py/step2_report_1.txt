  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All snippets are just import statements from the 'yeref' package, with no further code.\n- The package 'yeref' is not a standard library, raising suspicion about its origin.\n- Wildcard imports ('*') are used in some reports, which can be a red flag if the package is untrusted.\n- The reports do not provide any evidence of malicious code or behavior; they only note minimal concerns based on structure and naming.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected; code is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.8\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. The high confidence aligns with the benign nature.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; no issues, benign imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.6\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. Slightly lower confidence due to minimal info.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Slight suspicion due to obscure package name and minimal code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3, confidence=0.4\n- **Verdict:** The risk score is slightly higher but still low, given no actual malicious activity is shown. The suspicion is noted but not confirmed.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Use of wildcard imports ('*') is a concern, as it can hide malicious functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.5\n- **Verdict:** The risk score is reasonable. Wildcard imports are discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Similar to above; only import statements with wildcard imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.5\n- **Verdict:** Consistent with the previous, no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking and Recommendations:\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which is consistent with the lack of malicious code in the snippets.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Zero, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly higher where wildcard imports are used, which is appropriate. The highest risk score (0.3) in Report 3 reflects some suspicion due to package naming, but without evidence, it remains low.\n- **Confidence levels:** Appropriately reflect the amount of information and suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code snippets are minimal and do not demonstrate malicious behavior.\n- The scores are reasonable, with minor concerns about package trustworthiness and import style.\n- Wildcard imports are a concern but not inherently malicious; further investigation into the package contents is recommended.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to package trust concerns and import style)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code snippets are benign in isolation. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the 'yeref' package and the use of wildcard imports, which could conceal malicious behavior if the package is malicious. No evidence suggests active malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nFurther investigation into the 'yeref' package's contents is warranted, but based on the provided snippets, the security risk remains low.",
