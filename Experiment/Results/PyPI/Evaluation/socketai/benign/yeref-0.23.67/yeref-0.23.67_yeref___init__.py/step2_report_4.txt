  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the provided code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code snippet is minimal: only two import statements from the 'yeref' package.\n- No functions, data processing, or execution logic are present.\n- The 'yeref' package is not a standard library, raising questions about its origin and contents.\n- Wildcard imports ('*') are used in some reports, which can be a concern for obscuring malicious code, but the original code snippet shows explicit imports, not wildcards.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior; just dependency setup.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 (high confidence that code is benign)\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal)\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; the code is benign. The high confidence is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1; no suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6 (moderate confidence)\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n- **Comments:** Again, only imports, no evidence of malicious intent. Slightly lower confidence seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Slight suspicion due to obscure package name and minimal code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.4 (lower confidence)\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.3 (higher risk score, but still moderate)\n- **Comments:** The suspicion arises from the package name 'yeref' and the minimal code, which could be part of obfuscation. However, with only import statements, there's no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The risk score of 0.3 might be a bit high given the lack of evidence; perhaps 0.2 is more appropriate unless further context is provided.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Wildcard imports are used, which can hide malicious functions.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n- **Comments:** The concern about wildcard imports is valid. Since the code snippet shows explicit imports, but the report mentions wildcard usage, this suggests the report might be referring to a different or extended version. If the actual code uses wildcard imports, the risk is slightly higher, but still, no direct malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports; only import statements.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n- **Comments:** The caution about wildcard imports is valid, but the original code does not show them. If the actual code used wildcard imports, the concern is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scores:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, which aligns with the code snippet.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, but generally low, which is appropriate given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n\n- The code snippet is benign; no evidence suggests malicious activity.\n- The concern about 'yeref' being a potentially malicious package is valid but cannot be confirmed without inspecting the package contents.\n- Wildcard imports should be discouraged, but the original code snippet shows explicit imports, so the reports referencing wildcards might be considering hypothetical or extended code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal context, a risk score of 0.1 to 0.2 is appropriate. The current scores of 0.1 to 0.3 are acceptable but could be slightly lowered for reports with no suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\nBased on the provided code and reports, **the code is benign**. The minimal import statements do not indicate malicious intent. The suspicion mainly arises from the package name and minimal code, but without further evidence, the security risk remains very low.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the current evidence and reasoning.",
