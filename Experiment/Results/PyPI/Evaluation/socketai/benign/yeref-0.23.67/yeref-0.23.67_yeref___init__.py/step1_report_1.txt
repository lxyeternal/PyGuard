{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules from the 'yeref' package, likely for use in further processing or functionality within a larger program.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'yeref.yeref' and 'yeref.l_' modules, which are external dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or output occurs here.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible with only import statements; these set up access to module functionalities.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements without context, which alone is not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements from the 'yeref' package. No data processing, input/output operations, or suspicious code behavior is visible. Without additional context or functionality, it's not possible to determine malicious intent or security risks. The imports suggest dependency setup but do not indicate malicious behavior by themselves.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code simply imports modules, which is standard practice. No anomalies or malware indicators are present in this fragment.",
