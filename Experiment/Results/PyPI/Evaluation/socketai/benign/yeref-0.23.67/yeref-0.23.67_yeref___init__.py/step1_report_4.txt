  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the modules 'yeref.yeref' and 'yeref.l_'.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'yeref.yeref' and 'yeref.l_'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed; only imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') which can hide malicious or unintended behavior, but no malicious code is visible here.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from two modules within the 'yeref' package, using wildcard imports. Without inspecting the contents of these modules, it's impossible to determine if malicious behavior exists. Wildcard imports can sometimes be used to hide malicious code or unwanted behaviors, but in this snippet, no such behavior is evident. No other code or data processing is present to analyze.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not explicitly contain malicious behavior or security risks on its own; it merely imports modules. However, the use of wildcard imports warrants caution, as the actual contents of the modules could be malicious. Further inspection of 'yeref.yeref' and 'yeref.l_' is recommended.",
