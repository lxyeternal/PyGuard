  "purpose": "Import modules from the 'yeref' package, likely for further use within the code.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'yeref.yeref' and 'yeref.l_' modules",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in the provided code snippet",
  "flows": "Imports loaded into the namespace; no data flow or untrusted data processing visible",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomaly; the code only contains import statements without any other logic or data handling",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements from the 'yeref' package. There are no functions, data inputs, or other operations that could suggest malicious intent. Without additional context, these imports alone do not indicate malicious behavior. However, the nature of the 'yeref' package and its modules cannot be assessed from this snippet alone. The code appears benign but is incomplete for a full security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on these import statements, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is minimal and standard in structure. Further context would be needed to determine the overall intent.",
