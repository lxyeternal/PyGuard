  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'yeref' Python package, defining package metadata and data inclusion.",
  "sources": "Static package data specified in setup parameters; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only package metadata configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Commented out code lines related to package installation and upgrades; no suspicious or malicious commands. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The comments include instructions for package build and installation, which are typical and do not indicate malicious activity. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is detected. The commented lines do not execute but show typical package management commands.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
