  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project named 'yeref', including package metadata and a data file. It contains only benign comments related to build and installation commands.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including package_data and comments with shell commands.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no external communication, no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Static configuration without data flows or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of build and install commands in comments, but these are typical and do not execute or pose security risks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static setup script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. Comments are standard instructions, and no secrets or obfuscation are present. No network activity or code injection is detected. All signals indicate a benign package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting its benign nature.",
