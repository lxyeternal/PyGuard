  "purpose": "This module provides backwards compatibility for test skipping and deprecation features in the 'nose' testing framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'nose.plugins.skip' and 'nose.plugins.deprecated' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only imports modules without processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports specific components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated content are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes for test skipping and deprecation from the 'nose' testing framework. It includes comments indicating its purpose for backwards compatibility and future removal. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no execution of untrusted code. The imported modules are standard components of the testing framework and are unlikely to be malicious. The comments clarify the purpose and the potential future removal of this compatibility layer, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility shim for the 'nose' testing framework. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It solely imports classes to facilitate test management and maintains compatibility. Overall, the code is safe.",
