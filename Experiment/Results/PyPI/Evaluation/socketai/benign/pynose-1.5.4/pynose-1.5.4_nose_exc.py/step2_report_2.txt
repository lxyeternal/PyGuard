  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: importing classes `SkipTest` and `DeprecatedTest` from the `nose.plugins.skip` and `nose.plugins.deprecated` modules.\n- The purpose is clearly stated as maintaining backward compatibility with older versions of the `nose` testing framework.\n- No data flows, no untrusted inputs, no network or file operations.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign and purely for compatibility.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- The code only contains import statements with comments; it does not execute any logic, process data, or handle untrusted input.\n- The imported modules are part of the `nose` testing framework, which is a well-known, open-source testing tool.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n\n### Issue Presence:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  **No.** The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Any flaws?**  \n  **No.** The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate reasoning.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports give `0`. This is correct; there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports give `0`. The code is not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** All reports give `0`. Given the benign nature, this is appropriate.\n\n### Any Inconsistencies or Unreasonable Scores?\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n### Potential Risks:\n- The only potential concern might be if the imported modules themselves were malicious, but given they are standard `nose` plugins, this is highly unlikely.\n- The purpose is solely for compatibility, with no dynamic or executable code beyond imports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a simple, safe, and standard compatibility shim. No security issues, no malware, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The reports are accurate and consistent.  \n- The code is benign.  \n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0",
