  "purpose": "Provides backwards compatibility for nose testing framework by importing skipped and deprecated test classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'nose.plugins.skip' and 'nose.plugins.deprecated'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external interactions; static import statements.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements for compatibility purposes. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The modules imported are standard parts of the 'nose' testing framework, which is open-source and well-known. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are present. The purpose is explicitly documented, and the code's simplicity confirms its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static compatibility layer with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
