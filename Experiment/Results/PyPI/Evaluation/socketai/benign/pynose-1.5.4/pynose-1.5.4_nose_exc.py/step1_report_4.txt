  "purpose": "This module provides backward compatibility for skipping and deprecating tests in the nose testing framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing 'SkipTest' and 'DeprecatedTest' from nose.plugins",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code merely imports classes/functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with comments explaining purpose. No data input, no data output, no dynamic code execution. The comments clarify intent, and imports are standard for the nose testing framework. No signs of malicious or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a straightforward compatibility shim.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or security risks. It simply provides compatibility for testing frameworks. No malicious intent or security issues identified.",
