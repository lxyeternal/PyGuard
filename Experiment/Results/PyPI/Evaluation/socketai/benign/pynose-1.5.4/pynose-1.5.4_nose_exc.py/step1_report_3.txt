  "purpose": "Provides backward compatibility for skipped and deprecated test handling in nose testing framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from nose.plugins.skip and nose.plugins.deprecated modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only imports modules.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only imports modules without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The comment is standard documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes for handling skipped and deprecated tests from the nose testing framework. It serves to maintain compatibility with older nose versions. The imports are from well-known, publicly available modules, and there are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No data is read or written, and there are no suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign compatibility layer with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely imports classes from known nose plugins and contains standard documentation.",
