  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe test harness built on Nose and unittest. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation at 0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) due to configuration interactions, which are standard in such tools."
