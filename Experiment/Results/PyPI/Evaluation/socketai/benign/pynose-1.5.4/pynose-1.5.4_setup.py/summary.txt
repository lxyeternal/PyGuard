  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate setup and release script with no malicious activity detected. The primary security consideration is the use of os.system(), which should be replaced with subprocess in production for enhanced security. Overall, the script is safe, with a low to moderate risk profile primarily due to command execution practices."
