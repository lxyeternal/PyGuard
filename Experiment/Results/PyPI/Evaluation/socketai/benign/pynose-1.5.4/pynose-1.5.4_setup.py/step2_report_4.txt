  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the script is a setup and release automation tool for the pynose package.\n- The primary operations involve reading files, user confirmation, and executing shell commands via `os.system`.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The use of `os.system` for executing package management commands is common but can be risky if inputs are manipulated.\n- The scripts do not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the script's purpose.  \n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious activity, notes `os.system` risks but considers them controlled.\n\n**Scores:**\n- malware: 0 (appropriate)\n- obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n- securityRisk: 0.2 (reasonable, given `os.system` usage)\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion is reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.  \n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Also finds no malicious intent, points out `os.system` usage and user input.  \n\n**Scores:**\n- malware: 0 (appropriate)\n- obfuscated: 0\n- securityRisk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Correct.  \n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Similar to others, notes standard package management, no malicious code, mentions `os.system` risks but no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**\n- malware: 0\n- obfuscated: 0\n- securityRisk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Correct.  \n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as above, highlights the standard nature, no malicious intent, but acknowledges `os.system` risks.\n\n**Scores:**\n- malware: 0\n- obfuscated: 0\n- securityRisk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Correct.  \n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Also finds no malicious behavior, notes `os.system` use and potential security considerations but no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**\n- malware: 0\n- obfuscated: 0\n- securityRisk: 0.3 (slightly higher, reflecting the more extensive use of system commands)\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score is justified given the multiple `os.system` calls, but still not indicating malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Justification**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign `0`. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign `0`, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.3, reflecting potential security concerns with executing shell commands via `os.system`. Given the context, these are standard for such scripts but should be used cautiously.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a typical setup and release script with no malicious intent.\n- The use of `os.system` introduces some security considerations but is not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.2** (to account for `os.system` usage, but not higher)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, with no malware or malicious behavior detected. The risk score could be marginally increased from 0.2 to 0.3 if desired, but 0.2 remains appropriate given the context.\n\n**Work-through complete.**",
