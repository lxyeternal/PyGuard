  "purpose": "Setup and release automation script for the 'pynose' Python package, managing description, versioning, and publishing process.",
  "sources": "File reads for README.md and version info, user input for confirmation, system commands via os.system for package management, build, and upload.",
  "sinks": "os.system() calls executing shell commands for package cleanup, build, and upload; user input influencing flow control.",
  "flows": "User confirmation input determines whether publishing proceeds; system commands depend on this flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() for executing multiple shell commands; reliance on external commands without input sanitization; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup and release tasks, reading description and version info, prompting user for confirmation, and executing shell commands for cleaning, building, and uploading packages. No malicious code, backdoors, or secrets are present. The use of os.system() is typical but could pose security risks if inputs are compromised. The code is straightforward and readable, with no obfuscation. The main concern is the potential for command injection if environment or inputs are manipulated, but no such exploitation is evident. The scores reflect low malware and obfuscation risks, with a moderate security risk due to system command execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate setup and release script with no malicious activity detected. The primary security consideration is the use of os.system(), which should be replaced with subprocess in production for enhanced security. Overall, the script is safe, with a low to moderate risk profile primarily due to command execution practices.",
