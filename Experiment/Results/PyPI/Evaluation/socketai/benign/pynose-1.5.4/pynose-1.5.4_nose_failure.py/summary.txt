  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for test failure reporting. The only notable risk is the potential for malicious exceptions to be executed during re-raising, which is a known pattern in testing but should be considered in untrusted contexts. Scores should be adjusted to malware=0.4 and securityRisk=0.3 to better reflect this potential, though in normal controlled environments, the risk remains minimal."
