      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate setup and release script with no malicious activity detected. The primary security consideration is the use of os.system(), which should be replaced with subprocess in production for enhanced security. Overall, the script is safe, with a low to moderate risk profile primarily due to command execution practices."

It poses minimal security risk, primarily related to dependency fetching during testing, which is typical and not malicious. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for test failure reporting. The only notable risk is the potential for malicious exceptions to be executed during re-raising, which is a known pattern in testing but should be considered in untrusted contexts. Scores should be adjusted to malware=0.4 and securityRisk=0.3 to better reflect this potential, though in normal controlled environments, the risk remains minimal."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, controlled import system designed for specific use cases. It does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. However, its capability to execute arbitrary module files without validation introduces a moderate security risk if untrusted modules are loaded. The scores assigned in the reports are generally appropriate, but the potential for malicious code execution warrants a slightly higher malware score (~0.5) and risk score (~0.6). Proper validation or sandboxing would mitigate this risk."

The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation at 0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) due to configuration interactions, which are standard in such tools."

The minor risks associated with threading and global state are acceptable within this context. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's purpose and implementation."
