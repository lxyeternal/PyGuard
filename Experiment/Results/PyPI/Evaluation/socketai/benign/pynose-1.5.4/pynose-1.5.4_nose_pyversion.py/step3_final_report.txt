  "purpose": "Compatibility fixes and utility functions for the 'nose' testing framework, including method handling, exception formatting, and version compatibility.",
  "sources": "Standard library modules (sys, os, traceback, types, inspect, nose.util), internal exception info, function objects, class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Exception formatting functions, string conversions, method attribute access, source code location retrieval.",
  "flows": "Exception info and traceback data flow into string formatting functions; method objects flow through unbound method classes and attribute access.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data handling. Use of deprecated 'new' module is noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides compatibility and debugging utilities, operating solely on internal data and standard library functions. No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. Functions handle exception info and method objects safely, with no signs of malicious behavior. The low risk scores assigned in reports are justified given the code's utility nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard compatibility utility module with no malicious intent. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.2) are accurate and consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
