  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, controlled import system designed for specific use cases. It does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. However, its capability to execute arbitrary module files without validation introduces a moderate security risk if untrusted modules are loaded. The scores assigned in the reports are generally appropriate, but the potential for malicious code execution warrants a slightly higher malware score (~0.5) and risk score (~0.6). Proper validation or sandboxing would mitigate this risk."
