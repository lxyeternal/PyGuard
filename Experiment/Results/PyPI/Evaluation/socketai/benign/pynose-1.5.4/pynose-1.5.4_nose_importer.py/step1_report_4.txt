  "purpose": "Custom module importer for path-specific, isolated imports, primarily to avoid conflicts with test modules with identical names in different directories.",
  "sources": "Reading module files from specified paths, checking for existing modules in sys.modules, accessing environment through os and sys modules, and reading files for encoding detection.",
  "sinks": "Loading modules into sys.modules, executing module code via spec.loader.exec_module, and potentially modifying sys.path.",
  "flows": "Import functions read module files and execute them, then store the modules in sys.modules; importFromDir reads module files and loads modules; add_path modifies sys.path; sameModule checks file paths to prevent duplicate loading.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of internal importlib components is standard. The code re-implements import mechanics with custom path handling, but no suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines Python's import system for path-specific module loading, with functions to locate, load, and manage modules. It reads files from paths, respects module caching, and manipulates sys.path carefully. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or obfuscated code detected. The code's primary purpose is to control module import paths securely. All operations are standard for custom importers and do not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate custom importer designed for controlled module loading from specific paths, with no indicators of malicious intent or supply chain attacks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security risks beyond normal import handling. The implementation appears standard and safe.",
