  "purpose": "Setup and configuration for 'nose' testing framework, including version parsing and compatibility adjustments.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, reads version string (__version__), and performs a compatibility fix for collections.Callable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external input, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Version string is parsed into integers, then reconstructed; the compatibility fix assigns collections.Callable to collections.abc.Callable.",
  "anomalies": "The assignment 'collections.Callable = collections.abc.Callable' for Python >= 3.10+ is a known compatibility workaround, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for the 'nose' testing framework. It imports modules, processes version info, and adjusts for Python version compatibility. No external data handling, no network activity, no code execution, and no obfuscation are present. The compatibility fix is a standard practice. All signals indicate benign, standard code with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
