  "purpose": "A dependency decorator that executes a function only if all specified dependencies return True, otherwise logs a skip message.",
  "sources": "Dependency functions called with 'self' as argument",
  "sinks": "Logging via Environment.get_default_logger().debug",
  "flows": "Dependency functions -> wrapped_f -> logger (if dependencies fail)",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward dependency check with logging",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'depends' that wraps a function to check multiple dependencies before execution. It calls each dependency with 'self'; if all return True, it executes the function. If any return False, it logs a debug message indicating the skip. The code uses a safe logging method and does not process untrusted input or handle secrets. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The logic is simple and standard for dependency management in testing frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency management decorator with no malicious intent or security issues. It only logs skipped dependencies and does not handle untrusted data or perform any suspicious operations. The overall security risk is minimal.",
