{
  "purpose": "Define a decorator to run a function only if certain dependent functions succeed, primarily for managing dependencies in testing or execution flow.",
  "sources": "The decorator inspects the list of functions passed as dependencies, which are executed or checked within the wrapped function. It also accesses Environment.get_default_logger() for logging purposes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or user input; it primarily invokes functions and logs messages.",
  "flows": "The decorator calls each dependency function to determine whether to execute the target function, then conditionally executes it or logs a message.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No unusual or obfuscated language features. The code's logic is straightforward and typical for dependency-based decorators.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a higher-order function 'depends' that creates a decorator to control execution based on dependencies. Inside, it defines a wrapper 'wrapped_f' that iterates over provided dependency functions, executing or skipping the main function based on their return values. Logging is used for skipped executions. The reliance on an external Environment class for logging is standard. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. No external data input handling or data leaks are detected. The code appears to be for orchestrating execution flow in a testing environment, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency-checking decorator used for controlling function execution flow, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply manages dependencies and logs accordingly.",
