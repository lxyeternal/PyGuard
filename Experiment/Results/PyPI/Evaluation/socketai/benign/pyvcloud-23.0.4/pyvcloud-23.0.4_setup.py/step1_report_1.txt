  "sources": "Reads from the import statement for 'setuptools' and the setup() function call with dependency requirements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Imports dependencies, then calls setup() with fixed parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, importing standard packaging tools and specifying build dependencies. No suspicious or malicious code behavior is observed. There are no sources of untrusted input, no sinks that handle untrusted data, and no complex or obfuscated logic. The code is straightforward and follows standard practices for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
