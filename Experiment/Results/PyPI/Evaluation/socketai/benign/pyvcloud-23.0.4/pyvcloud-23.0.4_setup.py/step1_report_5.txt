  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package related to VMware vCloud SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own static configuration data for package setup, including dependencies.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted or external data. The code does not handle user input or network data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script only processes static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward setup script with standard library imports and no obfuscated or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it with fixed parameters to specify build requirements. There are no input sources, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. It is a minimal, conventional package setup script with proper licensing comments. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It merely specifies dependencies for building the package.",
