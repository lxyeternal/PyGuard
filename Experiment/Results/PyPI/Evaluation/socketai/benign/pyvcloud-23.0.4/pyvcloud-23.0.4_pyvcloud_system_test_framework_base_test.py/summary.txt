  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign test environment setup script with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious actions justifies a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for its purpose."
