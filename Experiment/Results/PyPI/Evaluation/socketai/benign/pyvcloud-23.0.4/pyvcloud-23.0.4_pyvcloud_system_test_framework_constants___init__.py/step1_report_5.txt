{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from environment variables, user input functions, or external data files.",
  "sinks": "Data could be written to files, printed to stdout, or sent over network connections if present.",
  "flows": "Potential source-to-sink flows depend on data handling, such as reading input, processing, then output or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual or suspicious code patterns are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python syntax, with typical control flow and data handling. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, obfuscated strings, or hidden behaviors. The code's functions and variables are straightforward, and no external suspicious library usage or malicious payloads are observed. The absence of network connections, file tampering, or credential handling reduces suspicion. Overall, the code seems benign and purpose-driven without malicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a normal, non-malicious Python program.",
