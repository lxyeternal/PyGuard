  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variable reads, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), network activity, input handling.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, system modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data potentially leading to code execution or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of eval/exec, suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code shows signs of obfuscation, environment variable reads, and potential dynamic execution, which are suspicious but not definitively malicious. No concrete malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or payloads is confirmed. The scores reflect moderate suspicion, with a malware score of 0.1-0.2, obfuscation at 0.7, and moderate security risk around 0.3-0.4. The absence of code in some reports justifies zero scores. Overall, the evidence suggests cautious monitoring rather than immediate threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and suspicious patterns but lacks definitive malicious activity. The adjusted malware score for Report 1 is 0.1, aligning with the cautious suspicion. Other reports correctly identify the absence of code or benign patterns. No immediate threats are confirmed, but ongoing vigilance is recommended.",
