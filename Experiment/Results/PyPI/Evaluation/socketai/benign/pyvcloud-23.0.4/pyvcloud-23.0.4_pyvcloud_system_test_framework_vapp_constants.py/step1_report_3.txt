  "purpose": "Define constants related to a vApp configuration in VMware vCloud Director SDK.",
  "sources": "Class attribute assignments (name, network1_name, network1_cidr, network1_ip_ranges, vm1_name). No input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data, no data leaks or insecure operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; all are static attribute assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded values are typical for constants; no suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with static string and list attributes representing configuration constants. It does not perform any dynamic operations, data processing, or external communication. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward constants class used for configuration purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this code.",
