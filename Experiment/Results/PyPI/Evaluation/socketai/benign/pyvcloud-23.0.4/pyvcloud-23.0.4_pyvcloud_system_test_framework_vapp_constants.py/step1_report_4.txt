  "purpose": "Define constants related to a VMware vCloud Director vApp configuration.",
  "sources": "Class attribute assignments for vApp parameters such as name, network, IP ranges, and VM name.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The IP address and network ranges are hardcoded but appear to be standard configuration values.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class defining static configuration parameters for a vApp. It contains only constant string and list assignments with no dynamic execution, user input, or external data handling. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, serving solely as a container for configuration constants without any malicious intent or security risks.",
