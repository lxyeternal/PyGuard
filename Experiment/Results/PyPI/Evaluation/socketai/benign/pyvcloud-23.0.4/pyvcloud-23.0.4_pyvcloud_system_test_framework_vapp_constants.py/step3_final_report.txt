  "purpose": "Configuration constants for VMware vCloud Director setup, defining network and VM parameters.",
  "sources": "Static class attributes assigned at class definition (name, network1_name, network1_cidr, network1_ip_ranges, vm1_name).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external input; no sinks that process external data or perform I/O.",
  "flows": "N/A – static constants without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple class with static configuration constants. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, or external data processing. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The constants are hardcoded configuration values, which pose minimal security risk. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0 or near-zero. The code does not perform any external operations or contain secrets, so the likelihood of malicious intent is negligible. The scores are consistent with the code's static, configuration-only purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration class with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
