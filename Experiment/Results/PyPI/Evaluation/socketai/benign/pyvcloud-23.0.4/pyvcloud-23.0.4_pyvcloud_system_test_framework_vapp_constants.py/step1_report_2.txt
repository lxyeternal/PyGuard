  "purpose": "Defines constants for a VMware vCloud Director SDK, likely used for creating or managing virtual applications (vApps).",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external input or output are evident in this static class definition.",
  "anomalies": "Contains hardcoded values such as vApp and network names, IP ranges, and CIDR blocks; no secrets or credentials are embedded.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class defining static string and list attributes for vApp configuration. There are no functions, input handling, or dynamic execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. It appears to be a simple configuration container without any complex or risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration class with no evidence of malicious intent, no data leakage points, and no suspicious behavior. It serves as a container for constants related to vApp setup.",
