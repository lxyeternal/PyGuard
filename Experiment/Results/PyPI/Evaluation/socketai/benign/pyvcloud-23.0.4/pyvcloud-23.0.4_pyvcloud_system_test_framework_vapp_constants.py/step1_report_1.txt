  "purpose": "Define constants for a VMware vCloud Director SDK operation, specifically related to a vApp and its network and VM names.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string values for vApp name, network name, CIDR block, IP range, and VM name.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input, data leak, or malicious data output points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; static values are used as constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a class with static string and list attributes representing configuration constants. It does not read external data, execute dynamic code, or contain any suspicious activity. No potential security issues or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward configuration class with hardcoded constants, typical in SDK or API wrapper code. No malicious or suspicious behavior present.",
