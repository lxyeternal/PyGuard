  "purpose": "Define constants related to VMware vCloud Director's vApp configuration",
  "sources": "Class attribute assignments (name, network1_name, network1_cidr, network1_ip_ranges, vm1_name)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; static constants only",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources; static data used directly in code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all values are static and predefined",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class with static attributes representing configuration constants. There are no inputs, no dynamic code execution, no external data sources, and no sensitive information handling. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration holder without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration class defining constants for VMware vCloud Director SDK use. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
