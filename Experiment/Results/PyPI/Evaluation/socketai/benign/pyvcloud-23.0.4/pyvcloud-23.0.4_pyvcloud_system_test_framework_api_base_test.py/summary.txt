  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious setup for testing VMware vCloud SDK. No signs of malware or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is the disabled SSL verification (`verify_ssl_certs=False`), which should be addressed in production environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2–0.3 due to the insecure SSL setting."
