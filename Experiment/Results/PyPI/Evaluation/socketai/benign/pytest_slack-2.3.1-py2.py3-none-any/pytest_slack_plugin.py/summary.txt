  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pytest plugin for Slack notifications with no malicious intent or behavior. Its security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the trustworthiness of user-supplied URLs. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's functionality."
