  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Anomalies:**  \n   All reports consistently indicate that the code only assigns a version string to the `__version__` variable, with no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, external calls, or malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that this is a minimal, standard version declaration. No logical errors or flaws are evident, as the code's purpose is straightforward.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasonableness:**  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of obfuscation.  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since the code does not introduce any security concerns.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is a simple version string assignment, there is no reason to assign a higher risk score. The code does not perform any actions that could compromise security or privacy.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions or Claims:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They do not assume malicious intent where none exists. The code is benign.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and correctly reflect the code's nature.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code snippet is a straightforward, benign version declaration with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No further action or concern is necessary for this code snippet.",
