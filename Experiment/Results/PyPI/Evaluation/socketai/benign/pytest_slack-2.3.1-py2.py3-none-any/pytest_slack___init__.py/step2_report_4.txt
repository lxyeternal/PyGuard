  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the code in question:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string (`__version__ = '2.3.1'`) with no additional logic, input, or output. The code snippet is minimal and standard for Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their description. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent.  \n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the summaries or conclusions.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.  \n   - Given the simplicity and benign nature of the code, these scores seem appropriate.  \n   - No changes are necessary unless future context suggests otherwise.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   - Since all reports agree that the code is a straightforward version string assignment with no malicious activity, the risk scores are justified at 0.  \n   - The code does not perform any data handling, external calls, or obfuscation that would elevate the risk.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the code's benign nature.  \n   - No suspicious behavior or malicious code is present.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   - All claims are based on the code snippet provided.  \n   - Given the simplicity, assumptions about malicious intent are unwarranted.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis provided.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \n- The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns.  \n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores are appropriately low (all zero).  \n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
