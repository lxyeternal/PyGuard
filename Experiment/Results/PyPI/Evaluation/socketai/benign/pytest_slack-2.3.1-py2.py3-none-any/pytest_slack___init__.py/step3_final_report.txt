  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code does not process external data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no external inputs, outputs, or complex logic. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version string assignment with no security concerns or malicious intent. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
