  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or control structures.\n   - The code is minimal, standard practice in Python packages, and does not include any obfuscation, external calls, or complex logic.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - All reports explicitly state that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies.\n   - The code does not read from or write to untrusted sources, nor does it perform any operations that could be malicious.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis: a straightforward version string assignment with no security concerns.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Logical Flaws**:\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent; no issues are apparent.\n   - The reasoning that this code is benign is sound.\n   - No assumptions are made beyond the code snippet provided; given the simplicity, this is reasonable.\n\n5. **Final Assessment**:\n   - Since all reports agree and the code is as minimal as shown, the risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should remain at 0.\n   - The confidence score of 1 is justified given the clear and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a standard version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code content.",
