{
  "purpose": "Define version information for a package using setuptools_scm generated code",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, reading from version control metadata (implicitly via generated code)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed or used in security-sensitive ways",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static assignments only",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines version metadata for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm. It includes conditional typing imports and assigns version strings and tuples. There are no input reads, external data sources, or dynamic behaviors. The code is static and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard auto-generated version info snippet with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It simply defines version variables for package management purposes.",
