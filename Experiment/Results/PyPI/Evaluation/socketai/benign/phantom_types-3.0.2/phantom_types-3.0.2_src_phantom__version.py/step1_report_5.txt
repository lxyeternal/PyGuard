{
  "purpose": "This code defines version-related variables for a package, generated by setuptools_scm, to manage version information without manual updates.",
  "sources": "The code assigns version strings and tuples directly within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is used or could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "The flow involves assigning static version strings to variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The use of conditional type hints is standard and harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version variables statically. The 'if TYPE_CHECKING' block is for type hinting purposes and does not execute at runtime. The actual version values are hardcoded as strings and tuples, which is typical for version management. No dynamic code, input reading, or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard auto-generated version file with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply declares version variables for package management.",
