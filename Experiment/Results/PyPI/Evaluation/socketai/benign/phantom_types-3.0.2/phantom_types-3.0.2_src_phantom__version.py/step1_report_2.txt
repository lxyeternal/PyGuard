  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, and conditional import statements for type checking.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version strings and tuples; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING for conditional imports is standard practice; no anomalies or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version-related variables with hardcoded values. It includes a conditional import block for type checking, which is typical for type hints. The version string '3.0.2' is statically assigned, and no dynamic or external data is involved. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, auto-generated version definition snippet with no malicious intent or security concerns. It serves to provide version information for the package.",
