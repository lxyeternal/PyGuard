  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version string and tuple, conditional type checking block.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input used.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version variables; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for version info, no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated version declaration with static values. It uses standard Python practices for type hints and version management. No external inputs, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code serves solely to define version variables and contains no security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and generated by a common tool. It poses no security threat, contains no obfuscation, and has no malicious intent. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
