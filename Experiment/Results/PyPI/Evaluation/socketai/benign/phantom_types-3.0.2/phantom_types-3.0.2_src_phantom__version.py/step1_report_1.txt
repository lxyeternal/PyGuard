  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to be used in version management and package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code assigns a version string and tuple directly within the script; no external input is read.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is used or propagated to sensitive sinks. The code only sets variables.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment of version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed; the code is straightforward and generated by a standard tool.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a version string and a version tuple for package versioning. It uses a conditional to define types for type checking purposes, which is common in Python projects. The version is statically assigned as '3.0.2', with no external data or user input involved. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a standard generated version file used for package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign, automatically generated version definition for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data sources, and no security risks.",
