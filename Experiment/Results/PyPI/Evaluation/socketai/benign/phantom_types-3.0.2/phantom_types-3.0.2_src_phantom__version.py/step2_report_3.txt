  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Overall Code Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward, auto-generated version declaration for a Python package.\n- It assigns a static version string and tuple.\n- It uses a conditional block for type hinting purposes, which is standard practice.\n- There are no external inputs, dynamic behaviors, or suspicious constructs.\n- The code is generated by setuptools_scm, a common tool for version management.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code only contains static assignments, conditional type hints, and no external data or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report?**  \n  **No.** The reports are consistent and accurately describe the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  The code contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, no backdoors, and no suspicious activity.  \n  **Score: 0** is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or complex tricks.  \n  **Score: 0** is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Since the code is purely static, generated by a standard tool, and contains no external inputs or dynamic code, the risk is minimal.  \n  **Score: 0** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent with the code.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all observations are based on static analysis.\n- The code's purpose is solely to define version info, with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' evaluations and the code's actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard, auto-generated version declaration with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
