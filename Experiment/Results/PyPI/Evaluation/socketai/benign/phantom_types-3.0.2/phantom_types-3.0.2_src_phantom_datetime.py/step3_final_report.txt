  "purpose": "Provides datetime types with optional dependency on python-dateutil for parsing strings into datetime objects, and defines custom classes for timezone-aware and naive datetimes with schema and hypothesis strategies.",
  "sources": "Input objects to parse_datetime, class methods parse, and the parse_str function for string conversion.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network activity; data flows from input through parsing functions to internal datetime objects.",
  "flows": "Input objects -> parse_str -> parse_datetime_str -> datetime object; class methods -> parse -> parse_datetime.",
  "anomalies": "Standard dependency fallback raising MissingDependency exception; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code manages optional dependencies gracefully, converting inputs to datetime objects with error handling. Custom classes extend datetime.datetime for timezone-aware and naive types, including schema and hypothesis strategy registration. No external communication, data leaks, or malicious code is present. The fallback for missing dependencies is standard, and the parsing logic is straightforward. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, dependency-managed datetime utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, with appropriate error handling and clear logic. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal dependency handling concerns.",
