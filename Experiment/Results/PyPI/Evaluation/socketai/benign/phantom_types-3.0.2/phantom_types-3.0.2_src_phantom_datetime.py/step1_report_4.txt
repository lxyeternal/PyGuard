  "purpose": "Provides custom types and parsing functions for handling timezone-aware and naive datetime objects, with optional dependency on python-dateutil for string parsing.",
  "sources": "Import statements, try-except block for optional import of dateutil.parser, parse_str function, and class methods that invoke parse_datetime.",
  "sinks": "parse_datetime function calls parse_datetime_str, which may raise exceptions; no data sinks for untrusted input lead to dangerous operations, external connections, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input data (strings or datetime objects) are processed via parse_datetime; parsed data flows through to type validation in TZAware and TZNaive classes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import with fallback raises an exception if dateutil is missing; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data leaks; code structure is standard, no obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom datetime types with schema and hypothesis strategies, conditionally imports dateutil.parser, and raises a custom exception if missing. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are present. The try-except pattern is standard for optional dependencies. No data exfiltration, malicious behavior, or malware signatures identified. The code appears to be well-structured for a types module with no hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a utility for datetime handling with optional external dependency. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks detected. The only notable aspect is the conditional import with exception handling, which is typical for optional dependencies and does not introduce security concerns.",
