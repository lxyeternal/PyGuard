{
  "purpose": "Defines regex-based string validation classes with schema and predicate support.",
  "sources": "Class attribute __pattern__ set during subclassing, pattern compilation via _compile.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data leaks; pattern matching occurs during class definition.",
  "flows": "Pattern is compiled and assigned during class creation; no runtime data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external input handling.",
  "analysis": "The code compiles regex patterns safely, uses standard class inheritance and attribute resolution, and provides schema and hypothesis support. No external inputs or network activity are present. The pattern compilation is standard and occurs during class definition, not at runtime with external data. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are detected. The overall structure is typical for validation frameworks, and no anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of regex-based pattern classes with schema support. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The low security risk score (0.1) is justified due to dynamic pattern compilation, which is typical in such frameworks but could pose a risk if patterns are externally supplied in an unsafe context. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
