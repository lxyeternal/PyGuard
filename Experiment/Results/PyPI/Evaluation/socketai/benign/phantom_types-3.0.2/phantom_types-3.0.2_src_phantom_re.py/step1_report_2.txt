{
  "purpose": "The code defines abstract classes for matching strings against specified regular expression patterns, with support for schema generation and hypothesis strategies.",
  "sources": "Pattern pattern argument in class methods (__init_subclass__, __schema__, __register_strategy__). No external data sources or user input are read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs. The code mainly processes class attributes and compiles regex patterns.",
  "flows": "The pattern provided during class definition is compiled and stored as a class attribute, used by predicates and schema generation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code uses standard Python features and external library calls as intended.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract classes 'Match' and 'FullMatch' for regex-based string validation. Patterns are compiled during subclass creation, with no runtime input processing or network communication. The functions and methods are straightforward, relying on external predicate functions and utils. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No dynamic code execution or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured, standard implementation of regex-based string validators with schema and strategy support. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is safe and does not contain malware or security risks.",
