  "purpose": "Define classes for pattern-matching string types using regular expressions, with schema and validation support.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, class attributes (__pattern__), and imported modules. It also processes patterns via _compile.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include regex compilation and dynamic class attribute resolution, which could be exploited if patterns are malicious or injected.",
  "flows": "Patterns provided during class subclassing are compiled and assigned to class attributes, then used in predicates and schema definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or unusual code. The code uses dynamic class attribute resolution and regex compilation, which are standard but could be risky if pattern inputs are maliciously provided.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract classes for matching strings based on regex patterns, resolving class attributes dynamically. It imports regex utilities and predicates for matching. The _compile function safely compiles pattern strings to regex objects. The classes use __init_subclass__ to set patterns and define schemas for validation. The pattern attribute is resolved dynamically, and the regex is used for matching via predicates. No suspicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The only minor concern is that pattern strings are compiled at class creation time, which could be manipulated if pattern values are externally supplied, but within the context of class definitions, this is typical.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern-matching class definition with no malicious behavior detected. It uses dynamic class attribute resolution and regex compilation securely within typical usage scenarios. No malware or security threats are identified.",
