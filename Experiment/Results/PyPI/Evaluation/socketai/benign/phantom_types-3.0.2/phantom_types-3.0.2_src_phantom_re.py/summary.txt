  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of regex-based pattern classes with schema support. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The low security risk score (0.1) is justified due to dynamic pattern compilation, which is typical in such frameworks but could pose a risk if patterns are externally supplied in an unsafe context. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured."
