{
  "purpose": "Define classes for matching strings against regular expression patterns, with support for schema generation and hypothesis strategies.",
  "sources": "The code reads pattern definitions from class arguments during subclass initialization and imports modules such as re, typing, and internal project modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output occurs that could lead to data leaks or code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Class initialization flows involve pattern compilation and assignment; no flow from untrusted input to critical functions or output.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to use standard regex compilation and class methods. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. Use of __future__ import is benign here.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract base classes with pattern attributes, using regex compilation to enforce string pattern matching. Subclass initialization resolves pattern attributes dynamically and sets up predicates for matching. Schema methods generate descriptive metadata. No external inputs are read at runtime, and pattern compilation uses standard re.compile. No evidence of malicious code such as network calls, file access, or hidden backdoors. The code appears well-structured for schema validation and pattern matching purposes, with no suspicious behaviors or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard pattern-matching class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It relies solely on regex pattern compilation and class attribute resolution. No malware, obfuscated code, or security threats are detected.",
