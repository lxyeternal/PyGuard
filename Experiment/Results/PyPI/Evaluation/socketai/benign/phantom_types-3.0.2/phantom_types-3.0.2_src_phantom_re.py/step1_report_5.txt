{
  "purpose": "Define classes for representing string patterns that match using regex, facilitating pattern matching and validation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially 're', 're.Pattern', and internal modules; class definitions and their methods; __init_subclass__ methods which set class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Regular expression compilation in _compile(), pattern attribute in classes, and potential predicate functions like is_match and is_full_match that utilize regex patterns.",
  "flows": "The pattern argument is processed and compiled in _compile(), then stored in class attribute __pattern__. This pattern is used in predicates and schema generation. No untrusted external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward, primarily for pattern validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two abstract classes, Match and FullMatch, which are designed for regex pattern matching. They compile regex patterns upon subclass creation, store them as class attributes, and set predicates for pattern matching. The __schema__ methods provide schema info, and __register_strategy__ integrates with hypothesis for property-based testing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network access, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The pattern compilation and predicate setup are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured, standard implementation for regex pattern matching classes. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is detected. It performs pattern validation and schema registration securely. Overall security risk is very low.",
