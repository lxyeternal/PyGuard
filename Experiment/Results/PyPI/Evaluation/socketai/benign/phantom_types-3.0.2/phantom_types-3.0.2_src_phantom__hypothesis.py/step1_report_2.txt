  "purpose": "Define type aliases and conditional imports for hypothesis strategies, with optional registration function.",
  "sources": "Reading the __future__ import, type checking conditions, and import statements.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up type annotations and optional imports.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import with fallback to None, but no suspicious or malicious code behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages type annotations and optional integration with the 'hypothesis' testing library. It conditionally imports 'SearchStrategy' for type checking purposes and sets up a type alias 'HypothesisStrategy' for testing strategies. It also defines a placeholder for 'register_type_strategy' and attempts to import a function of the same name, falling back to None if not available. There is no dynamic code execution, data handling, or suspicious activity present. The use of 'TYPE_CHECKING' is standard practice for type hints that do not affect runtime behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a benign setup for type annotations and optional hypothesis library integration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
