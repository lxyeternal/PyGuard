{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and manage optional imports for the 'hypothesis' testing library, ensuring compatibility and type safety.",
  "sources": "Conditional import of 'register_type_strategy' from 'hypothesis.strategies', type alias definitions, and fallback assignment to None.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow from external inputs; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Import attempt flows from 'hypothesis.strategies' to local variables; no data processing or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of fallback to None for optional import is standard; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup for type annotations and optional library integration, employing standard Python practices such as TYPE_CHECKING and try-except for optional imports. It contains no data leaks, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The fallback pattern is common for optional dependencies, and no data flows or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for type safety and optional integration with 'hypothesis'. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores should reflect this benign nature, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a security risk score at 0, indicating no threat.",
