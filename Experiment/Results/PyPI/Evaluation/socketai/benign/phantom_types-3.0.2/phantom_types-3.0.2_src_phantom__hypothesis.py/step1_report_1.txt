  "purpose": "Define type aliases and conditional imports for hypothesis strategies, facilitating type-safe test strategies.",
  "sources": "Conditional import of 'register_type_strategy' from 'hypothesis.strategies'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Conditional import flow from 'hypothesis.strategies' to local variable 'register_type_strategy'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints; no suspicious or obfuscated code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases and conditional imports based on the presence of the 'hypothesis' library. It sets up type annotations for hypothesis strategies and registers. The conditional import safely falls back if the library isn't installed, avoiding runtime issues. No dynamic code execution, no data leaks, and no malicious logic observed. The code structure is straightforward and intended for type hinting support.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard type annotation and conditional import setup for the 'hypothesis' testing library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign utility module for type annotations.",
