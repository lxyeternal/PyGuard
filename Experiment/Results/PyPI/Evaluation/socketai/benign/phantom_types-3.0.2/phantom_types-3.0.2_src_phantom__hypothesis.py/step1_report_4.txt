  "purpose": "Define type aliases and conditional imports for hypothesis strategies, and attempt to assign a function for registering strategies if available.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, typing, typing_extensions, and hypothesis modules; assignment to register_type_strategy based on ImportError.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No data flows to sinks that could cause data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no untrusted data sources or flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional import with fallback assignment; no suspicious or unusual code behavior; the code appears to be for type hinting and compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type aliases and handles optional import of 'register_type_strategy' from the 'hypothesis' package, with a fallback to None if not available. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. No code executes harmful actions, connects to external systems, or performs obfuscated operations. The code appears to be standard for typing and compatibility purposes.\n\nThe presence of conditional import and fallback is normal in Python packages to maintain compatibility across environments. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The logic is straightforward and primarily concerned with type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup for type aliases and optional imports related to hypothesis strategies. It contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
