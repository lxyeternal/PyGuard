{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and conditional imports for hypothesis strategies, with an attempt to import a registration function if available.",
  "sources": "Code reads from __future__ import annotations, imports from typing, typing_extensions, and hypothesis.strategies.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could originate from imported modules, but none are evident in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up type aliases and optional imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses conditional import with a fallback to None, which is standard. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases and conditional imports for hypothesis strategies, including a try-except block to handle missing imports gracefully. It uses standard Python typing and conditional logic. No data input, network access, or untrusted data processing occurs. The code appears to be part of a type hinting or testing framework setup, with no malicious behavior or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard setup for type hinting and optional importing of a hypothesis strategy registration function. There is no malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no security risks present.",
