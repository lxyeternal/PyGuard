  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No issues found; code is straightforward type aliasing and conditional import.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified; reasoning sound.  \n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, securityRisk is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No issues; similar to Report 1, standard pattern for optional imports.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, securityRisk at 0, consistent with benign code.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No issues; code is a typical setup for type annotations and optional imports.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, securityRisk at 0, justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No issues; standard conditional import pattern.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) perhaps due to the mention of potential untrusted data sources, but no actual untrusted data is involved.  \n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, securityRisk at 0.1—this seems somewhat overstated, but not unreasonable given the cautious approach.  \n- **Conclusion:** Slightly conservative but acceptable.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No issues; standard pattern.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, securityRisk at 0, consistent.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior; malware score should be **0** across the board.  \n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; score should be **0**.  \n- **Risk Score:** The code is benign, primarily setting up type aliases and handling optional imports. The minimal securityRisk scores assigned (like 0.1 in Report 4) are cautious but acceptable, though perhaps slightly overestimating the risk.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code does not execute any untrusted data, does not perform network operations, nor does it contain obfuscated or malicious code.  \n- The use of conditional imports and type aliases is standard practice for compatibility and type hinting, with no security implications.  \n- The scores should reflect the benign nature: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0** or very close to zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the actual code content.",
