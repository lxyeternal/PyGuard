{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and export classes and functions related to 'phantom types' in Python, enabling type-like checks with boolean predicates.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_base, _version, bounds, errors, predicates), and module-level definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted. The code does not handle input, output, or network operations.",
  "flows": "The module primarily imports classes and functions and exposes them via __all__, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward, standard for module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical module initialization script: it imports several classes and functions from internal modules, then exposes them via __all__. It includes a sample docstring demonstrating usage but does not execute or process data at runtime. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. There are no network operations, no dynamic code execution, nor any handling of untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python module setup, exporting classes and functions for use elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and solely intended for type and predicate management within a larger codebase.",
