{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python module that implements phantom types using boolean predicates, allowing for type-safe distinctions at runtime based on predicates.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: ._base, ._version, .bounds, .errors, .predicates",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; imports are static and serve as module definitions",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the module primarily defines classes, constants, and imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behaviors are observed. The code primarily consists of imports, type annotations, and module exports",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes and functions from local modules, defines the __all__ export list, and includes a docstring explaining usage. There are no dynamic code execution, external data reads, or suspicious patterns. The module appears to be a straightforward library setup with no embedded malicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard library module that defines types and imports without any malicious intent or security concerns. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malware indicators are present.",
