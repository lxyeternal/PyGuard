{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that provides a framework for creating phantom types in Python based on boolean predicates, enabling type-safe distinctions without runtime overhead.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._base, ._version, .bounds, .errors, .predicates; no external input or data sources are used within this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data, perform I/O, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; the code mainly defines classes, constants, and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward, mostly involving imports and definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several components related to phantom types and versioning, defines an __all__ list for module exports, and provides example usage in the docstring. No dynamic code execution, external inputs, or potentially malicious behavior is evident. The code structure is standard for a Python package interface file, focusing on exposing relevant classes and functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module definition for a phantom types library. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It functions as a straightforward interface for the package's core features.",
