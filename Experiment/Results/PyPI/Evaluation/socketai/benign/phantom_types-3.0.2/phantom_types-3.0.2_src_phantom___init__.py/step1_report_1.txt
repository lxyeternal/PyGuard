{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and export components related to creating phantom types in Python, specifically using boolean predicates to define type conditions.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_base, _version, bounds, errors, predicates) and the code snippet demonstrating usage of phantom types.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data outputs, no network or file I/O; the code mainly deals with type definitions and imports.",
  "flows": "The flow is primarily import-based, with no evident flow of untrusted data; the usage example shows static code with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is straightforward, focusing on type creation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module setup with imports, exports, and a usage example comment. It imports internal components for phantom type creation, version info, bounds, errors, and predicates. The sample usage demonstrates creating a phantom type 'Big' based on a predicate, which is safe and typical for such libraries. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code does not perform any network operations, data leakage, or system modifications. All components appear to be part of a type utility library for enhancing static typing in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign library module designed for type hinting and phantom types. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a standard, well-structured implementation without obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
