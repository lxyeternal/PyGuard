  "purpose": "This module provides utilities for creating phantom types based on boolean predicates, enhancing static type checking.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_base, _version, bounds, errors, predicates) and the usage example defining a predicate function.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present; no untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "The code imports internal components and defines __all__; no runtime data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward import and export setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup for a phantom types library, importing internal components and exposing them via __all__. The usage example demonstrates creating a phantom type based on a predicate. There are no runtime data processing, network operations, or malicious behaviors. The code is static and purely structural, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for phantom types, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No further action or concern is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
