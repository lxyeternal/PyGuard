{
  "purpose": "The code provides imports and setup for a Python library called 'Phantom' that enables creation of phantom types using boolean predicates.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._base, ._version, .bounds, .errors, .predicates.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external network, file operations, or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the code mainly imports modules and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be straightforward module setup with imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components necessary for the 'Phantom' library's operation, such as base classes, version info, bounds, errors, and predicates. It defines __all__ to specify public API exports. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or handling of untrusted input. The content is standard for a Python package's __init__.py or module setup file, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization script that sets up the public API for the 'Phantom' library. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
