  "purpose": "Utility functions for displaying type bounds, creating parsers that validate objects against complex type constraints, and a specific parser for strings.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'instance' in validation functions, external predicate functions ('is_union', 'all_of', 'of_type', 'of_complex_type') used for type checks.",
  "sinks": "Raising 'BoundError' when validation fails; no other data sinks or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into 'get_bound_parser' and 'display_bound', passes through predicate functions for validation, and either returns the validated value or raises an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. External predicate functions are assumed safe and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward runtime type validation utilities, leveraging external predicate functions for complex type checks. It raises standard exceptions on validation failure. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns, and performs no network or side-effect operations. External dependencies are assumed benign based on naming and context. The overall behavior aligns with typical validation modules, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for type validation and parsing, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The external predicate functions are presumed safe. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
