{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of interval classes for numeric types with schema generation and strategy registration, including inclusive, exclusive, and half-open ranges.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, standard typing, contextlib, and internal modules; class attributes (__low__, __high__, __check__); class methods; and functions that resolve class attributes and bounds.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include the use of eval-like patterns in __schema__ methods for schema generation, but no dynamic code execution is observed; class attribute resolution functions modify class attributes; no data sink points such as network or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Class inheritance and __init_subclass__ methods set bounds and check functions; __schema__ methods generate schema representations; __register_strategy__ methods create hypothesis strategies based on bounds.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns; use of suppress for exception handling is standard; no obfuscated code or unusual language features are present; the code primarily handles numeric bounds and schema generation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of abstract base classes for numeric intervals with inclusive, exclusive, and half-open bounds. It uses class attributes to set bounds and check functions, resolving defaults where needed. Schema methods generate JSON schema snippets. Strategy registration methods conditionally generate property-based test strategies based on bounds, using hypothesis strategies for floats and integers. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection are detected. The code appears to be a well-structured, domain-specific library for interval validation and schema generation with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, domain-specific implementation of interval classes for validation and schema purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The structure is consistent with standard patterns, and the functions serve well-defined roles. No security risks or malware are evident.",
