{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of interval classes for numeric validation, schema generation, and property-based testing support, allowing for custom and concrete interval types with inclusive, exclusive, and half-open ranges.",
  "sources": "Class attributes (__low__, __high__, __check__), imported predicate functions, and utility functions for bounds resolution and schema creation.",
  "sinks": "Schema definitions, test strategy registration functions, and class attribute assignments; no external network, file I/O, or system modification.",
  "flows": "Initialization and subclassing of interval classes set bounds and check functions; schema methods generate JSON schema snippets; strategy registration methods produce test data based on bounds.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. Exception handling for bounds validation is standard. No external or malicious data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, purpose-specific library for numeric interval validation and schema generation. It uses class attributes and methods appropriately, with standard exception handling and no external side-effects. Imports are from local modules presumed safe. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The logic is straightforward, focusing on data validation, schema support, and test data generation, with no network activity or external command execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-designed library for defining numeric interval types with schema and testing support. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the utility nature of the code without any signs of compromise.",
