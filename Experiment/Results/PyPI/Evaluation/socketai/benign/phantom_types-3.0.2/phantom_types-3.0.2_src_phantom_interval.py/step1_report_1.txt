{
  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of interval types for numeric ranges with various inclusivity/exclusivity bounds, supporting schema generation and property resolution.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (e.g., .predicates, .schema, ._utils), class attributes (__low__, __high__, __check__), and method parameters (e.g., check, low, high).",
  "sinks": "Class attribute assignment (_resolve_bound), schema methods, and hypothesis strategy registration, which could generate test data for the defined intervals.",
  "flows": "Class definitions initialize bounds via __init_subclass__, setting attributes; schema methods read class attributes for schema output; __register_strategy__ methods generate test data based on bounds.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or backdoors. Use of exception handling around bounds, but no suspicious logic. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs; code is well-structured for defining numeric interval types.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base class 'Interval' with subclasses for different interval types (Inclusive, Exclusive, etc.). It manages bounds through class attributes and uses classmethod constructors for schema and test strategy generation. The logic appears standard for data validation and schema generation, with no evidence of malicious intent. All imports are from local or standard libraries. No suspicious data flows, external network calls, or malicious data handling observed. Exception handling around bounds is standard, and no code injection or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a structured, well-formed library for numeric interval validation with schema support. It contains no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to serve its purpose for defining and validating numeric ranges securely.",
