{
  "purpose": "Define and manage numeric interval types with various inclusive/exclusive bounds, supporting schema generation and property validation.",
  "sources": "Imports of internal modules (. , .predicates, .schema, ._utils), class attribute definitions (__low__, __high__, __check__), method calls within class initializers (__schema__, __register_strategy__), and exception handling blocks.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the __schema__ methods where schema dicts are constructed, and the __register_strategy__ methods where hypothesis strategies are returned. These are generally safe; no data is being passed from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Class attribute resolution flows from defaults or inherited values into class attributes via _resolve_bound, then used in __schema__ and __register_strategy__ methods. The check functions are used during class initialization for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code, network activity, or system modifications are present. Exception handling is limited to raising _NonScalarBounds but does not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of interval classes with methods for schema representation and hypothesis strategy registration. The logic uses class attributes and utility functions to manage bounds, and the exception handling is straightforward. No dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or external network communication occurs. The only notable point is the use of exceptions for bounds validation, which is standard. Overall, the code appears purely structural with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of well-structured interval type definitions for data validation and schema generation, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It adheres to expected patterns for such utility classes and does not contain any suspicious behavior or malware indicators.",
