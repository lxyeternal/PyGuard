{
  "purpose": "This code defines various interval types for numeric values, including inclusive, exclusive, and half-open ranges, with schema support and hypothesis strategies for testing.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries and local modules; class attributes (__low__, __high__, __check__) that define bounds and check functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no code execution or data exfiltration points identified.",
  "flows": "Class attributes (__low__, __high__, __check__) are set during class initialization; schema methods generate schemas based on these bounds; strategy registration functions generate test data based on bounds.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of suppress() for exception handling is benign; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured set of class definitions for numeric interval types with support for schema generation and hypothesis strategies. It uses standard type hints, class attributes, and class methods for configuration. The bounds are dynamically resolved during class subclassing. No external data input, network communication, or malicious logic is present. The code focuses solely on defining data structures and associated schema/strategy methods without any harmful side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate library component for defining numeric intervals with schema and testing support. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The code is well-structured and focused on its purpose without suspicious patterns.",
