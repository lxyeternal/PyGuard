{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of interval-based classes for numeric ranges, including inclusive, exclusive, and half-open ranges, along with utility functions and schema representations, primarily for validation and data modeling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class attributes (__low__, __high__, __check__), class initializers (__init_subclass__), and methods like parse and __schema__.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present that process untrusted input into sensitive actions or data leaks. The code does not perform network operations, file I/O, or external command execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attribute resolution (__low__, __high__, __check__) through class initialization (__init_subclass__), into schema generation (__schema__), and potential data generation strategies (__register_strategy__).",
  "anomalies": "The code includes dynamic class attribute resolution, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. Exception handling is used for type errors. No external or hidden side-effects are observable. No backdoors or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured implementation of interval types with clear class hierarchies and schema definitions. It uses type variables and protocol classes for flexibility. The functions handle bounds resolution and validation checks. No unsafe or malicious behaviors, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection, are present. The only potential concern could be if the interval check functions (e.g., interval.exclusive) are malicious, but these are imported from external modules presumed safe. The code focuses on data validation and schema representation, which are standard in data modeling libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of interval types for data validation purposes, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It primarily defines numeric range classes and related utilities. No malicious intent or suspicious patterns are detected.",
