{
  "purpose": "Defines collection size-bound types for use with immutable collections, supporting schema generation and runtime type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library, typing extensions, and local modules; class initializations; predicate and schema definitions.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is read from untrusted sources or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Class definitions and initializations mainly involve setting size constraints and schemas, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Class methods primarily define schemas and constraints without executing harmful operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on defining collection size-bound types with appropriate validation and schema representations. Uses type hints, predicates, and class inheritance to implement size constraints. No network, file, or environment variable operations are present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic detected. The code appears to be standard for a type/schema system, with no malicious intent or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of class definitions for collection size constraints and schemas, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation for type validation and schema generation in a Python library.",
