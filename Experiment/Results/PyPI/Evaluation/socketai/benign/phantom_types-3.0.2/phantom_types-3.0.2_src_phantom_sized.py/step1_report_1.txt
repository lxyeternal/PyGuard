  "purpose": "Define collection size-bound types for use with immutable collections, supporting schema generation and validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries and internal modules; class attribute initializations; __init_subclass__ methods; __schema__ methods; __register_strategy__ methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe use of dynamic class attributes (__min__, __max__) in predicate construction; use of external libraries such as hypothesis without sanitization; no direct untrusted input handling; no network, file, or system command operations observed.",
  "flows": "Class definitions initialize size constraints based on class arguments; __init_subclass__ propagates size constraints and builds predicates; __schema__ methods generate schemas based on class attributes; __register_strategy__ methods create data generation strategies using hypothesis, dependent on class size attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network calls or file operations. The code heavily relies on class attributes and dynamic predicate composition, but nothing appears malicious or unusual in that pattern. Use of internal and third-party types is consistent with library design.",
  "analysis": "The code implements size-constrained collection types for schema validation, with mechanisms to enforce size bounds and generate data for testing. The use of class attributes (__min__, __max__) and class methods for schema and strategy registration appear standard for such libraries. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. No external data sources, network calls, or system modifications are evident. The only potential concern is dynamic predicate composition, which aligns with typical validation patterns. Overall, the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines size-bound collection types for schema validation and testing, with no indications of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It is a standard implementation pattern for data validation libraries, with appropriate use of internal and external modules. The overall security risk is negligible.",
