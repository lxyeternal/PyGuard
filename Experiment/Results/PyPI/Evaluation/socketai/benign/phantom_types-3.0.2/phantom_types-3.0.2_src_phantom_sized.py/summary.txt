  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation for size-constrained collection types, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low security risk scores are justified, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at zero. The overall assessment indicates the code is safe and appropriate for use."
