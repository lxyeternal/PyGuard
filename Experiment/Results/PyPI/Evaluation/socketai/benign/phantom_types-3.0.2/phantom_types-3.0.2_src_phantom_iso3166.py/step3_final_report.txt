{
  "purpose": "Provides validation, normalization, and type safety for ISO3166 alpha-2 country codes, enabling mixing static literals with runtime parsing.",
  "sources": "Input objects passed to parse_str in normalize_alpha2_country_code and ParsedAlpha2.parse functions.",
  "sinks": "Validation functions that check input against a predefined set of country codes; no data leaks or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input objects -> parse_str -> normalization -> validation against ALPHA2 set -> acceptance or exception.",
  "anomalies": "Accepts arbitrary objects in parse_str, which could be misused if malicious objects are passed, but this is standard validation behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of ISO3166 alpha-2 codes as a Literal union, with functions to normalize and validate codes. It uses phantom types for type safety. No network, file, or system operations are present. Validation is straightforward, raising exceptions on invalid input. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected. The only minor concern is handling untrusted input in parse_str, but this is mitigated by validation and exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for country code validation with no malicious intent or malicious code. It performs input validation and type enforcement without side effects. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to untrusted input handling, which is standard practice.",
