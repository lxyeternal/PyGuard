{
  "purpose": "The code defines types and functions related to ISO3166 alpha-2 country codes, including validation, normalization, and parsing capabilities.",
  "sources": "Input source is the parameter 'instance' in the 'parse' method of ParsedAlpha2 class, which reads external objects to parse as country codes.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the 'normalize_alpha2_country_code' function, which raises an exception if input is invalid, and the 'parse' method that normalizes and casts input to a specific type.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input to the 'parse' method, through 'parse_str', then validated via 'is_alpha2_country_code', and finally normalized and cast as ParsedAlpha2.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present; the code uses standard type validation, casting, and straightforward normalization. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated parts are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a list of ISO country codes via Literal, along with a frozenset for validation. The 'normalize_alpha2_country_code' function ensures input case-insensitivity and validation. The 'ParsedAlpha2' class provides parsing and schema registration, leveraging these utilities. No external network access, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code relies on standard Python libraries and clear validation functions. No backdoors, hidden code, or malicious payloads are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility module for country code validation and parsing. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended without malicious intent or security concerns.",
