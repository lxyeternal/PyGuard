{
  "purpose": "Defines types and functions for ISO3166 alpha-2 country codes, allowing both static literals and runtime parsing with validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (typing, typing_extensions), third-party modules (phantom), and uses constants and class methods for validation and parsing.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data in a way that could lead to data leaks or code execution. Validation functions ensure correct input formats.",
  "flows": "Input strings are normalized and validated in 'normalize_alpha2_country_code' which feeds into 'ParsedAlpha2.parse', ensuring safe use. No untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of 'phantom' for type validation is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive set of ISO3166 country codes as literals and provides a type-safe way to parse and validate country codes at runtime. Functions like 'normalize_alpha2_country_code' ensure case normalization and validation against the predefined set, raising 'InvalidCountryCode' if invalid. 'ParsedAlpha2' class provides parsing and schema registration methods. The use of 'phantom' appears to be for type validation purposes, not malicious activity. There are no indications of malicious code, data leaks, or exploits. The code maintains good validation practices and does not include any suspicious network or system operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured type definition and validation utility for ISO3166 country codes. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. It is safe for use, with standard validation procedures in place.",
