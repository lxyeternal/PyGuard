{
  "purpose": "Defines types and functions related to ISO3166 alpha-2 country codes, including validation, normalization, and schema registration.",
  "sources": "Reads input from objects passed to parse and normalize functions, and from string literals for validation.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed to cause harm or leak data. No network, file, or system modifications are observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through parse_str and normalization functions, validated against static literal sets, with no dangerous operations or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines static types, validation, and schema registration for country codes. It uses type aliases, runtime validation, and schema annotations without any side effects or external calls. No data is transmitted, stored insecurely, or manipulated maliciously. All functions perform expected validation and normalization without risk of injection, leaks, or malicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation for handling country codes with validation and schema metadata. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Overall security risk is minimal, and no malicious intent is evident.",
