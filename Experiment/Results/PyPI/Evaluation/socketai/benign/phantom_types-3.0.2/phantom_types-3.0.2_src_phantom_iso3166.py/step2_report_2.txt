  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines ISO3166 alpha-2 codes as literals and provides validation and parsing functions. It uses `phantom` for type validation, but no malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Security implications:** No suspicious behavior, no data leaks, no code execution, no network activity. Validation functions enforce correct input.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 (since it's a validation utility, but some might argue a minimal risk exists due to the use of `phantom`).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion that the code is safe is justified. The risk score could be slightly above 0, but 0.5 is acceptable if considering potential misuse of validation functions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing validation against static sets, no external network or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 (again, a validation utility with minimal risk).\n\n**Assessment:** Valid conclusion. The risk score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on input validation, normalization, and type safety. No external network or malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5.\n\n**Assessment:** The assessment aligns with the code's purpose. The risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, validation-focused, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Slightly more cautious, noting potential untrusted input flow and validation, but no malicious activity. Mentions a security risk of 0.2, likely due to input validation points.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** This is a reasonable cautious score, acknowledging that input validation is a potential attack surface if misused, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code or payloads. The code is purely for validation and type safety.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, but generally low. The highest is 0.5, which is acceptable given the validation nature. The fifth report's 0.2 reflects a cautious stance on untrusted input.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** — Very low, mainly due to input validation points, but no actual risk present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured utility for ISO3166 alpha-2 country code validation and parsing. No security risks or malware are evident. The scores in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal validation-related risk, but practically negligible)  \n\nThis assessment aligns with the evidence and the purpose of the code.",
