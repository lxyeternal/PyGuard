{
  "purpose": "Defines types and functions for handling ISO3166 alpha-2 country codes, including literal types, parsing, normalization, and validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'instance' parameter in 'parse' method and from 'country_code' parameter in 'normalize_alpha2_country_code'. It also uses 'get_args' to derive valid codes from the Literal type.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the normalization and validation process, which checks input against a predefined set of country codes. No untrusted external data or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (country codes) flows from user inputs or external sources into 'parse' or 'normalize_alpha2_country_code', which validate and cast the data to internal types, enforcing constraints.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for type validation; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. It uses standard libraries and type annotations. No obfuscated or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a type-safe approach to handling country codes, with validation against a fixed set of ISO3166 alpha-2 codes. Functions normalize case and enforce code validity. The use of 'Phantom' and 'Predicate' is for type refinement but does not introduce any malicious behavior. The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or system modifications. There are no hidden or malicious payloads. Overall, the code is well-structured, standard, and appears intended solely for validation and type enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is safe and designed for type validation and normalization of country codes. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. Its purpose is purely to enforce valid ISO3166 alpha-2 codes with no security risks.",
