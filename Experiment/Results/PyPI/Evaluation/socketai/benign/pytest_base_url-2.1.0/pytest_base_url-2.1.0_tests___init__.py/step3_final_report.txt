  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source dependency based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "No code provided; analysis based on descriptions and summaries.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks identified due to absence of code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows possible without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is missing or incomplete, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly acknowledge the absence or incompleteness of code, leading to low or zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The only exception is Report 4, which assigns a high confidence score (0.8) despite no code evidence; this overstates certainty. Adjusting this confidence score downward to around 0.2-0.3 would better reflect the lack of data. The scores are consistent with the descriptions, and no suspicious activity or malicious behavior is indicated in any report.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The assessments are appropriate, with a minor recommendation to lower Report 4's confidence score to better match the lack of code. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears benign.",
