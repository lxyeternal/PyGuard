  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific task or function as intended by the package author. However, without seeing the actual code, the purpose cannot be definitively identified.",
  "sources": "The code potentially reads input data from function arguments, environment variables, or external files. Specific sources cannot be identified without the actual code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, subprocess calls, or evaluation of dynamic code, which could be used to exfiltrate data or execute malicious commands.",
  "flows": "Data flow paths from sources to sinks could lead to code execution, data leakage, or other malicious effects, but without actual code, these paths cannot be confirmed.",
  "anomalies": "No specific anomalies can be identified without seeing the code. Look for hardcoded credentials, unusual function calls, obfuscated code, or hidden logic if available.",
  "analysis": "Unable to perform a detailed analysis due to lack of actual code content. The general approach involves identifying sources, sinks, and flow paths, and checking for suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or network connections. Since the code content is missing, a precise assessment cannot be completed.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to determine the presence of malicious behavior. Based on the absence of code, no definitive malicious or security risks can be identified. More details are needed for an accurate evaluation.",
