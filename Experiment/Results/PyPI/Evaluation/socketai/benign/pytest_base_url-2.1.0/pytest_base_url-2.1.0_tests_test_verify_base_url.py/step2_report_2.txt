  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes retry logic, environment variables, and request URLs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or sensitive info exposure; environment variables influence retry behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code performs version checks, modifies retry attributes, and runs tests simulating network failures. All standard testing practices.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or vulnerabilities detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.2) seems reasonable given the test nature. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar in scope, focusing on unit testing retry behavior with environment variables and mock server responses.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns; no malicious activity or obfuscation. The zero security risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on testing retry logic and environment variables, with no suspicious code.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) might be due to the environment variable manipulations, but since it’s purely for testing, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar to previous, testing retry and URL verification.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Again, standard retry/error handling tests.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with straightforward test code.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.2), justified by environment variable manipulations, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious code are present.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is purely test code for retry logic, environment variable configurations, and error handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious payloads.\n- The environment variable manipulations are standard for testing different configurations.\n- The error messages and exception handling are typical for test scenarios and do not leak sensitive data.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, mainly due to environment variable manipulations, but no real vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent with the code's intent and structure. The scores are reasonable. The code appears safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and minimal security risk.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores; they accurately reflect the code's benign and testing nature.",
