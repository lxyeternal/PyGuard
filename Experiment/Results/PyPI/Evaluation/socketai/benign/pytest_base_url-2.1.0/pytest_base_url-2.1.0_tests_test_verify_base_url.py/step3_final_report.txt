{
  "purpose": "The code implements unit tests for retry logic, environment variable-based configuration, and error handling in HTTP requests using pytest and mock servers.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('VERIFY_BASE_URL'), retry configuration attributes, and HTTP server responses.",
  "sinks": "No sensitive data leaks; test assertions focus on error messages and retry behavior.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and server responses influence retry attributes and error handling; no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version checks, manipulates retry attributes based on environment variables, and tests error scenarios such as server errors and DNS failures. All practices are standard for testing retry mechanisms. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or security vulnerabilities. The environment variable manipulations are typical for configuration testing, and error messages are standard for test failures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard, benign unit tests for HTTP retry logic and configuration. There is no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and no security vulnerabilities. The existing malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
