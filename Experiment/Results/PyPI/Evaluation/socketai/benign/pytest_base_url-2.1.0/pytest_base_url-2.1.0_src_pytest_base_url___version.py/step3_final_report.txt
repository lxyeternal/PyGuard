  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version information with static values, conditional type annotations, and no external data handling. It is generated by setuptools_scm, a standard practice. No dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code is benign, with all signals indicating safe, straightforward version metadata management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version info snippet with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
