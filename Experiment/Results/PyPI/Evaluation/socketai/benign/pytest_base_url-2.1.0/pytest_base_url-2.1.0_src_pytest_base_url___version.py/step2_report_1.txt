  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version information setup, generated by setuptools_scm, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The code simply assigns static version strings and tuples, with conditional type annotations. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activities are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of external data handling, network operations, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- They also correctly interpret the purpose of the code as benign version metadata management.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.  \n- These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n- Since all reports conclude no malicious activity, the risk scores should remain at 0.  \n- Any higher score would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations**  \n- The code contains no malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.  \n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's content.  \n- Their assessments are reasonable and well-founded.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \n- The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis and the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n### My Own Estimate:\n\nGiven the thorough review, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, auto-generated version info snippet with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis provided.",
