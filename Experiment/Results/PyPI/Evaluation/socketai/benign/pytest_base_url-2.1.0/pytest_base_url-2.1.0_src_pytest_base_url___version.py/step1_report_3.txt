  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; standard version declaration",
  "analysis": "The code sets version variables for a Python package, with conditional typing support. It assigns version info in a straightforward manner without dynamic execution or external data sources. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The structure and content are typical for a version module generated by setuptools_scm. No hardcoded credentials or privacy leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration script generated by setuptools_scm, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
