  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to manage package versioning.",
  "sources": "Reading version string and version tuple assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or input handling that could lead to data leak or effect.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static version assignment without external input or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for version management, with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally defines a version tuple type for type checking, but defaults to an object otherwise. It assigns static version information to variables. There are no inputs, external data, or dynamic behaviors. The code includes standard comments indicating it's auto-generated by setuptools_scm. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version management snippet with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious features.",
