{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and manages version data with conditional type annotations.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; no data leaks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks; variables are statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward version info setup with standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports type annotations based on TYPE_CHECKING, then assigns static version info to variables. It appears to be auto-generated, with no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. There are no external data sources, network operations, or obfuscated code. The purpose is solely to provide version metadata for the package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version info setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
