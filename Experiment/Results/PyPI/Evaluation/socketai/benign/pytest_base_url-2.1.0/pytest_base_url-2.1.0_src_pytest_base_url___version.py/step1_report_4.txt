{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, primarily for tracking and metadata purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string '2.1.0' assigned directly to variables __version__, version, and version_tuple.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or external data sinks; the code only sets variables internally.",
  "flows": "The version string is assigned to multiple variables; no external data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior are present. The code contains a standard pattern for version handling, with conditional typing support.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard version info file generated by setuptools_scm, with conditional typing support. It assigns fixed version data to variables and does not process external input or perform any dynamic or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign version information declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical pattern used for package versioning.",
