  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, used for version tracking.",
  "sources": "The code assigns version strings and tuples directly within the script; no external input is read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points present.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version data to variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is straightforward version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The script sets version information for a package, using hardcoded version strings and tuples. It includes conditional typing annotations but does not perform any input/output, external communication, or data manipulation beyond variable assignments. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign version definition snippet generated by setuptools_scm. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
