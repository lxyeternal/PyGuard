  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing and possibly network communication, but without explicit context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly present; potential data sources could be environment variables or imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of dynamic code, but none are explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows identified in the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code constructs are evident. The code uses standard Python features and libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious behaviors. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are apparent. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate, and no insecure coding practices are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code seems benign and does not pose a supply chain security threat.",
