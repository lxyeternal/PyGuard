  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly clear as the code appears to be empty or missing.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources detected due to lack of code content.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows observed because the code does not contain any executable statements or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code provided is empty or missing, which is unusual and may indicate incomplete submission or obfuscation attempt. No signs of malicious or suspicious activity are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code is entirely absent or blank, making it impossible to evaluate for malicious behavior or security risks. Without code, no source, sink, or flow analysis can be performed. The absence itself is suspicious if expected to contain logic.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the empty code submission, there are no signs of malicious behavior. The lack of code could suggest an incomplete or intentionally hidden script, but no malicious indicators are evident in the provided snippet.",
