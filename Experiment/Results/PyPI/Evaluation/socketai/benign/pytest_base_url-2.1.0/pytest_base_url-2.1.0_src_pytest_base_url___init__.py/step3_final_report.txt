{
  "purpose": "The code performs data processing, environment variable reading, or network communication without any suspicious activity detected.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, data processing functions, standard input/output",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables, network connections, or file operations (none identified as malicious)",
  "flows": "Environment variable reads → Data processing or network operations (no malicious flow detected)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns observed; code appears straightforward and benign",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables and performs standard data processing or network communication without signs of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The absence of code or activity is correctly interpreted as low risk. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the observations. Confidence is high due to the lack of suspicious features; no obfuscation or malware detected. The flow from source to sink is benign, with no anomalies or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The supply chain security risk is minimal. The current scores and analysis are appropriate and consistent with the observed code behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
