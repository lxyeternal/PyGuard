{
  "purpose": "The code consists of pytest test functions verifying configuration, fixtures, environment variables, CLI options, and metadata handling within a testing framework.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., PYTEST_BASE_URL), configuration files (.ini), and test fixtures.",
  "sinks": "Assertions within test functions; no external data transmission or malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and configuration files into test assertions and request objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets beyond test URLs; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward pytest testing code verifying configuration and environment handling. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The environment variables are used solely for testing purposes, and all data flows are internal to assertions. The code is standard, well-structured, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of pytest tests for configuration and environment variables, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
