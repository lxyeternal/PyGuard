{
  "purpose": "This source code is a minimal Python configuration snippet for pytest, including a license header and a simple assignment to 'pytest_plugins'.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the license header comment and the assignment to 'pytest_plugins'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code contains only static assignments.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the license comment and the assignment to 'pytest_plugins', but these are static and do not involve untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license header and a static assignment to a variable used for pytest plugin configuration. There are no dynamic elements, input/output operations, or suspicious constructs. The code is standard for test configuration files and does not contain any obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pytest configuration snippet with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
