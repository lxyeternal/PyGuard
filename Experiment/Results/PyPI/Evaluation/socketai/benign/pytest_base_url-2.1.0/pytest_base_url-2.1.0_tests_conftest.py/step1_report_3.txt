  "purpose": "Configuration for pytest framework plugin integration",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns a string to a variable",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; no flow present",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code or logic; only licensing comment and plugin assignment",
  "analysis": "The code contains a licensing comment and a single assignment statement. It does not perform any input, output, or data processing. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present. The licensing comment is standard and unrelated to code execution. The 'pytest_plugins' assignment is typical for plugin configuration in testing setups. There are no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious code indications.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration file for pytest plugins with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
