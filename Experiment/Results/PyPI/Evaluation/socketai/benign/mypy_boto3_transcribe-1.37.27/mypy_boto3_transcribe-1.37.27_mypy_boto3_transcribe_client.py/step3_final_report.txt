  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for AWS Transcribe SDK, providing a structured interface for API calls.",
  "sources": "Method parameters unpacked from type definitions, used as kwargs for API requests.",
  "sinks": "API methods that perform network requests, resource modifications, or URL generations; potential data flow points but standard for SDKs.",
  "flows": "Input kwargs flow into API calls; no direct data leaks or malicious data flows within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; standard SDK interface code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, type-annotated SDK client class for AWS Transcribe, with method signatures that wrap API calls. No executable logic, embedded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The network-related methods are typical for SDKs and do not indicate malicious intent. The parameters are unpacked from type definitions, which are standard for type safety. The code's structure and content are consistent with auto-generated or manually written SDK interface code, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SDK interface for AWS Transcribe, with no malicious, suspicious, or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal and primarily related to the inherent nature of SDKs that perform network and resource operations, which is expected and not malicious.",
