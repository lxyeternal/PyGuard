  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the AWS Transcribe service, enabling type-safe interaction with the AWS SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard modules, third-party libraries, and type definition modules; class and method definitions; property and method implementations.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code defines an interface for AWS Transcribe service interactions, primarily passing and returning data structures without executing external commands or network operations directly.",
  "flows": "Method signatures accept kwargs unpacked from type definitions, returning structured response types; no actual data processing or external data flow is present within this interface definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code strictly defines types and method signatures without runtime logic or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a type-safe interface wrapper for the AWS Transcribe client, utilizing Python type annotations to ensure correct usage. It imports necessary modules, defines an exception class, and a client class with properties and methods corresponding to AWS API operations. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present. The structure is straightforward, adhering to standard SDK client definitions, and contains no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured type annotation and client interface for AWS Transcribe, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is intended solely to facilitate type-safe SDK usage.",
