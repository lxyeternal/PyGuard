  "purpose": "Declare the version of the software package as a static string.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static assignment to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025) is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static Python snippet assigning a version string to __version__, with a comment and a copyright notice. No dynamic code, external inputs, or suspicious constructs are present. The only minor anomaly is the future year, which is likely a placeholder or typo. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
