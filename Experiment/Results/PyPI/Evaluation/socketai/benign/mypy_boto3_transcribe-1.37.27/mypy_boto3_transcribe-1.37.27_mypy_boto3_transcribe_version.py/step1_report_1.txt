  "purpose": "Defines the version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ = \"1.37.27\") and the comment about the source of truth for version information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment of version string with no data manipulation or external input.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment and a static assignment of a version string to __version__. It contains no input handling, no external data access, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious indicators. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose of setting version metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard practice for defining package version information with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
