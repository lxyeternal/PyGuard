  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the underlying code.\n\n**Code review:**\nThe code is a minimal Python snippet:\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.27\"\n```\nIt contains only a comment, a copyright notice with a future year, and a static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, static, and contains no dynamic or malicious elements.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The only potential concern is the copyright year being in the future (2025). This could be a typo or placeholder, but it doesn't introduce security risks.\n\n### Scores and their appropriateness:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — Correct. No malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 — Correct. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- All scores are zero, which aligns with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n### Potential assumptions and claims:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is purely declarative.\n- The reports correctly identify that there are no data flows, no external inputs, and no suspicious constructs.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports uniformly assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe only minor note is the future year (2025) in the copyright, which might be a placeholder or typo, but it does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a simple, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.  \n- No changes needed.\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
