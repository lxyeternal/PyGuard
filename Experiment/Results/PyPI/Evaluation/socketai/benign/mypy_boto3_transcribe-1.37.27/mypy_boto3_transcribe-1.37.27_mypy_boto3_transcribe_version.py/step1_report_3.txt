  "purpose": "Defines a version string for the package or module as a source of truth.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable with a string value.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or output data.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is simple assignment without data flow complexity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code structures; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string variable, which is a common practice for version control. It includes a copyright notice with a future year, but this does not impact security. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external interactions, and no embedded or obfuscated code. The code is static and simple, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to set a version string, a standard practice in Python packages.",
