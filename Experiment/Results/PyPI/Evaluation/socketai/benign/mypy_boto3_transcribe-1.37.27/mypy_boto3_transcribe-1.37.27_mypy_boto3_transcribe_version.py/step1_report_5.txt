  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module.",

  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright statement with a future year (2025) might be unusual but not malicious; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a docstring comment and a single assignment of a version string. The comment indicates the source is for versioning, and the version string appears standard. The copyright year is set to 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date, potentially indicating a typo or placeholder. No code execution, input handling, or external communication occurs. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, harmless version declaration with a possibly future-dated copyright. There is no evidence of malicious intent or behavior.",
