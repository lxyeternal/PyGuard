  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-transcribe', configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the local README.md file for long description; static metadata passed to setuptools.setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network activity or dynamic code execution",
  "flows": "Static data from file read flows into setup configuration; no external data flows involved",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and follows best practices",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads a local README file and passes static package metadata to setuptools.setup(). It involves no dynamic input, untrusted data, network activity, or obfuscation. All signals indicate benign behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and static nature. No vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code adheres to standard packaging practices, and the environment variables or external inputs are not used. Therefore, the overall security risk is negligible, and the package is safe for distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed setup script is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of zero across malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
