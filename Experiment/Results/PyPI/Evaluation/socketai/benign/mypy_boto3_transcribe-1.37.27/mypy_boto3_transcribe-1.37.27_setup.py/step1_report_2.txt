{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-transcribe', used to package and distribute the library.",
  "sources": "The script reads the README.md file for the long description; static strings for package metadata; dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the script does not execute untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "The script reads a file to get description content, then passes static data into the setup() function; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code follows standard setup script practices with no suspicious code, hidden behaviors, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a documentation file for the long description, and calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata and dependencies. All data are hardcoded or read from trusted files. No dynamic execution, user input, or external data processing occurs. The package metadata appears legitimate and consistent with standard Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks.",
