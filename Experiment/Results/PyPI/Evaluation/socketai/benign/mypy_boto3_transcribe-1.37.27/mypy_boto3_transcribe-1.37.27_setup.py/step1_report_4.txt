  "purpose": "This script is for setting up the package 'mypy-boto3-transcribe' using setuptools, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Path(__file__).parent / 'README.md', import statements, setup() arguments",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sinks detected",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content to variable LONG_DESCRIPTION, passing setup parameters to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed. The script appears straightforward for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a README.md for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and URLs. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no code execution beyond static package configuration, and no suspicious network or file operations. All data is static, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It contains no malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
