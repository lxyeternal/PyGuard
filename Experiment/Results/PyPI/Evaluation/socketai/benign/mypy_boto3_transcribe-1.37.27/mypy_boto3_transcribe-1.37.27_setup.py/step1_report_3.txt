  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors present. The code only performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and the setuptools package to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads the README.md file for the long description, specifies package details, URLs, classifiers, and dependencies. All code appears typical for a setup.py script, with no signs of malicious payloads or obfuscated code. No external input handling or network connections are present. The code’s structure and content align with standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
