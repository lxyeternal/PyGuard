  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, potential security concerns, or misalignments with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code's role in defining string literal types for type checking, based on conditional import of 'Literal' for Python compatibility.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that there are no data flows or data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Correctly states that the code is straightforward, static type alias definitions with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately classifies the code as benign, with high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar accurate description of defining string literals for type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes absence of data flow or untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Appropriately states that the code is static, with no embedded secrets or suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly concludes benign nature, with full confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the report's reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Properly describes the code's role in defining AWS service parameter literals.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly states no data processing occurs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies; standard compatibility pattern with conditional import.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid conclusion of benign, static type definitions.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the analysis is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the static nature of the literal definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly states no data flow from untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Recognizes the conditional import as standard practice, with no malicious implications.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes safety and benign intent.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the report is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as static literal type definitions for AWS parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes no data flow or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior; standard compatibility pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type alias definitions for string literals, used for type safety and documentation purposes.\n- **Malware & Security Risks:** No report indicates any malicious activity, suspicious code, or security risks. The conditional import pattern is standard for maintaining compatibility across Python versions.\n- **Any Anomalies or Obfuscation:** None detected. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear, static, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for static type checking, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
