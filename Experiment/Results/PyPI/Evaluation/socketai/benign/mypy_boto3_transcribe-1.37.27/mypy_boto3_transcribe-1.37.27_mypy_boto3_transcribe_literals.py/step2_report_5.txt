  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, potential issues, or overlooked risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for string literals used in the transcribe service module.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies that the code is static, purely declarative, and contains no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Clearly states zero malware and security risk.\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the code's nature. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on enabling type checking.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes the absence of dynamic or malicious code, with standard practices like version checks.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literal types for AWS services and regions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes the code as static, with no data flow or external data handling, and no malicious activity.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, defining literals for AWS parameters.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is static, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, defining string literals for AWS and transcribe parameters.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Consistent with previous assessments; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Assessment:** Valid conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Justification:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type alias definitions.\n- No dynamic code, external inputs, or network activity are present.\n- The conditional import of `Literal` based on Python version is standard practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The purpose is solely to improve type safety and code clarity.\n\n**Final Security Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard set of type annotations for AWS service parameters. It poses no security risks or malware concerns.",
