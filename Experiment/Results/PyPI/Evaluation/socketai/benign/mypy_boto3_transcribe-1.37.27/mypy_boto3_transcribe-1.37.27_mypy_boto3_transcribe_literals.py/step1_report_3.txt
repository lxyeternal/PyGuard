  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS transcribe service parameters and other AWS service identifiers.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module; usage of sys.version_info to determine import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines constants and type aliases without processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code solely declares type aliases using Literal for documentation and type checking purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports Literal from either typing or typing_extensions based on Python version. It then declares numerous string Literal types representing AWS services, regions, and other enumerations. There are no runtime data inputs, external data reads, or potentially malicious behaviors such as code execution, data exfiltration, or network activity. All code is static type declarations and comments intended for documentation and type hints. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely focused on type alias declarations for better code documentation and type safety. No malicious intent, malicious behaviors, or security risks are evident.",
