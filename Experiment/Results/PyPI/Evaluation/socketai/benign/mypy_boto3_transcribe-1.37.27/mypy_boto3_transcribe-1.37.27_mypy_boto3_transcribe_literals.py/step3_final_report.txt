  "purpose": "Define static type aliases for string literals used in AWS transcribe service and related modules, improving type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version; static string literal definitions assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; static definitions without data flow or runtime execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static type alias definitions, standard compatibility code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using 'Literal' for various string constants related to AWS services and regions. It includes a version check to import 'Literal' appropriately, which is standard practice for compatibility. There are no functions, data processing, external inputs, or dynamic code execution. The code does not contain secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. It serves purely for static type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and solely for type safety and clarity. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present. All signals indicate a safe, standard implementation of type annotations for AWS SDK parameters.",
