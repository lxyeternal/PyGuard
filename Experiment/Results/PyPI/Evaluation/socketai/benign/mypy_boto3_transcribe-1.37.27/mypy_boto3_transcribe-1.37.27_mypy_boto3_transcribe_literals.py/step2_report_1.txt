  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, potential issues, or misalignments with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code defines type annotations for string literals used in the transcribe service module, importing sys and conditionally importing Literal based on Python version.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or output, only type alias definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies detected; straightforward static definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurately describes the code as benign, static, and solely for type safety. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- Security Risk: 0 — no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate and aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the purpose of defining string literals for type checking, with standard import logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No unusual code or suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately describes the code as benign, static, and for type annotations, with no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malicious code.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is clear.  \n- Security Risk: 0 — no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code defines type literals for AWS services, with standard version check.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard practice.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly notes the static nature, no dynamic code, no malicious intent, and that the code is benign.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- Security Risk: 0 — no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the purpose of defining string literals with conditional import.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately characterizes the code as static, purely for type annotations, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malicious code.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n- Security Risk: 0 — no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code defines literals for AWS parameters, with standard import logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard compatibility code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly notes the code is static, for type safety, with no malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — straightforward static definitions.  \n- Security Risk: 0 — no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Assessment:** The report aligns well with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** Purely static type alias definitions for string literals used in AWS SDKs and services.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Security Risks:** None detected; code serves as static type annotations for better code safety and clarity.\n- **Scores:** All reports correctly assign malware and obfuscation scores as 0, and security risk as 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — the code is static, non-executable, and contains no malicious payloads.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard practices.  \n**Risk Score:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or security issues are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No further security concerns are identified.",
