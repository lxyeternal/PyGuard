  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, potential security issues, or discrepancies with the code.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a static set of type alias definitions using `Literal` for various string constants.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- No functions, data processing, external inputs, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code contains no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, purely declarative, and serves for static type checking.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  The code matches the descriptions in all reports. No issues are present; it’s straightforward type alias definitions.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' logic:**  \n  All reports correctly interpret the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. They accurately describe the purpose and structure.\n\n- **Scores assigned to malware, obfuscated, and security risk:**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk as 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n- **Justification of risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports justify a higher score; all are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  Since no malicious activity is present, malware score 0 is justified.\n\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as static type definitions with no vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code and its purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the thorough analysis, I concur with the reports’ conclusions. The code is purely static type alias definitions for documentation and type safety purposes, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Therefore, my final scores are:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the actual code content.",
