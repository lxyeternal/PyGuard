{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS transcribe service-related parameters and constants to ensure type safety and code clarity in type annotations.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from static string literals defined in the form of Python Literal types; no input reading or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows from untrusted sources to vulnerable functions or sensitive data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only defines constants and types.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. The only notable aspect is the conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard compatibility code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations using Literal for various predefined string constants relevant to AWS services. The conditional import for 'Literal' indicates compatibility across Python versions but does not introduce any security concerns. There are no dynamic code executions, external data reads, or suspicious behaviors. The structure is purely declarative, serving as type definitions for other modules. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious logic are present. The copyright notice and documentation link are benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign type declaration module designed to enhance type safety in AWS SDK usage. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks identified. It appears safe and appropriate for use in type annotations for AWS-related codebases.",
