  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literals used in the transcribe service library to enable type checking and improve code clarity.",
  "sources": "Import of 'sys' to check Python version; definition of string literal types and their assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data flow from untrusted sources; the code mainly consists of type alias definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares type literals.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; the license comment and version check are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines multiple string literal types as type aliases for use throughout the package. It contains no data handling, network operations, or external input. The literals are static and primarily serve for type safety. The license comment indicates documentation purpose, with no embedded executable or dynamic code. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or suspicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of type alias definitions for use in a Python package. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks present. It mainly serves as a static typing aid.",
