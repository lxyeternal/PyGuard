{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various string-based enumerations used in the boto3 transcribe service and other AWS services.",
  "sources": "Read from the 'sys' module to determine Python version; import 'Literal' or 'typing_extensions.Literal'; define string literal variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code primarily defines constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow between sources and sinks, as this is type definition code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version is normal; no unusual code structures or obfuscation observed. The code is purely static type definitions with no dynamic code execution or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines numerous Literal type aliases for various AWS and transcription service parameters. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice for compatibility. The structure is consistent, and there are no functions, external data reads, or potential sinks. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code, or suspicious logic are present. The code's purpose appears to be static type annotation setup for a larger codebase, with no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign collection of type aliases for AWS service parameters. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. It is standard type annotation code, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
