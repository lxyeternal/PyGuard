  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literal types used in the transcribe service module for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, conditionally imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version; defines numerous Literal type aliases for different string values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code only defines type aliases and performs no data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code solely establishes type annotations without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward type alias definitions without dynamic or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines multiple string literal types for use elsewhere. It includes a comprehensive list of string constants as type aliases, facilitating type safety and validation. There are no functions, data processing, external inputs, or outputs, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The code appears to be purely declarative for static type checking purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard definition of type aliases for string literals to be used in type annotations. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
