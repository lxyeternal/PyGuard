  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; mainly module setup and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up an interface for the AWS Transcribe service client, imports the client class, and provides documentation. It does not process user input, handle secrets, or perform network operations. The copyright statement is present but not suspicious. The code appears to be a standard module wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module interface for AWS Transcribe, with no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply re-exports a client class and includes documentation. Overall, safe to use.",
