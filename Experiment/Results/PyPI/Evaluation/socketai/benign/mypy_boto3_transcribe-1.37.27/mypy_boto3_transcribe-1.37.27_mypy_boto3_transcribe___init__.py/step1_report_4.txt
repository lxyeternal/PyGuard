  "purpose": "Provides a main interface for the transcribe service, importing and exporting the client class for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Imports 'TranscribeServiceClient' from a local module '.client'. No external data input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to untrusted data or security vulnerabilities observed.",
  "flows": "Imports from the local module flow directly into the module's namespace; no external data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs detected. The code contains only standard import and export statements, along with a documentation string.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple interface by importing a class and exposing it via __all__. It includes a docstring with usage instructions and a link to documentation. No runtime input, data handling, or potentially malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a straightforward module setup for SDK-like access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign interface setup for the transcribe service client. No malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks identified.",
