{
  "purpose": "A minimal interface module for AWS Transcribe service, providing a wrapper class for client interactions.",
  "sources": "Import of TranscribeServiceClient from local '.client' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static code with no data flow.",
  "flows": "Import and assignment of TranscribeServiceClient to Client, exposed via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and static. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year (2025), which appears to be a placeholder or typo but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static wrapper module that imports a class, assigns it to a variable, and exposes it. There are no data flows from untrusted sources, no network or file operations, no dynamic code execution, and no secrets or obfuscation. The documentation is purely descriptive. The future copyright year is noted but does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence (mostly 1). The slight reduction in confidence (0.9) in one report is justified due to the unusual copyright date. Overall, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward SDK interface wrapper with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
