  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the associated code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a CLI utility that displays static package info or version.\n- It checks for '--version' argument; if present, outputs version; otherwise, outputs package info.\n- No dynamic input, external data, or network activity.\n- The code is straightforward, with static strings and simple control flow.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  **No.** The code functions as described, with no evident bugs or vulnerabilities. It performs static output based on command-line input.\n\n- **Malicious behavior or malware?**  \n  **No.** The code only outputs predefined static information. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  **No.** The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Security risks?**  \n  **None.** It does not process untrusted data beyond a simple argument check, and no external calls or data leaks are present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**  \n- All describe the script as a benign CLI utility for displaying static package info and version.\n- They correctly identify that no untrusted data, external systems, or malicious code are involved.\n- They assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- They assign a security risk score of 0, which is justified given the static, read-only nature of the script.\n- The confidence scores are 1.0, consistent with the straightforward analysis.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n\n**Potential issues in reasoning?**  \n- None. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a benign CLI utility for static information display.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0.0** | **0.0** | **0.0** |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is entirely benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns. The reports correctly reflect this assessment.",
