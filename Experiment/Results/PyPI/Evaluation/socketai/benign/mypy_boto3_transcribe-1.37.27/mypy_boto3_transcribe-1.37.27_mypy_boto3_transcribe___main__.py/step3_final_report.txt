  "purpose": "A CLI utility that displays static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for outputting static strings",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), otherwise print_info() outputs static package info",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with static strings and simple control flow",
  "analysis": "The code reads command-line arguments to determine which static information to display. It writes output directly to stdout with predefined strings. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The code is simple, purpose-specific, and contains no secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. All functions perform static output, and no untrusted data influences behavior. The code's structure and logic are clear and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility that outputs static package info or version. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is straightforward, safe, and purpose-specific, with scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0. All reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
