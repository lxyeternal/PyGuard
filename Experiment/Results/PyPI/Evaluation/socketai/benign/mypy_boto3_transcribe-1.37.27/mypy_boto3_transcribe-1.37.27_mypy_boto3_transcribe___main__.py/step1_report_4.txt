{
  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the boto3 TranscribeService package, including version details and documentation links.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output messages",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output, no other untrusted data sinks identified",
  "flows": "User input (command-line args) triggers print_version(), which writes version info to stdout; otherwise, print_info() writes package info to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors; code is straightforward and documentation-focused",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that prints static package info or version based on user input. It reads command-line arguments but does not process untrusted data beyond the presence check. The outputs are static text messages to stdout. No data is read from or written to external sources, files, network, or environment variables. The functions are purely informational and do not perform any dangerous operations or data leaks. Overall, the code performs standard CLI output tasks without any signs of malicious intent or malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely intended for informational output via CLI. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks present.",
