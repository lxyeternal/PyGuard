  "purpose": "Provides CLI commands to display package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), writes to stdout (sys.stdout.write).",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write is used to output information; no untrusted input directly influences output content.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info() outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Code is straightforward with no obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script serves as a CLI interface for displaying static package information. It reads command-line arguments to determine which info to print. No untrusted data processing, no network activity, and no suspicious code flow are present. The functions only output predefined static strings. No external or secret data is handled. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware signatures detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package info or version details. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks.",
