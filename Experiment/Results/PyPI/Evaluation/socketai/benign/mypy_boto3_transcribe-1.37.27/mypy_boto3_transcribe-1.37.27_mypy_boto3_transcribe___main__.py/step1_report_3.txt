  "purpose": "The code provides CLI functions to display package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, outputs information via sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) triggers output functions; no data flow to or from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code structures. The functions perform straightforward printing operations.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI tool with functions to display package info and version. It checks for a command-line argument '--version' to decide whether to print version info; otherwise, it prints package info. There are no external inputs besides sys.argv, and outputs are static or informational. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious network activity detected. The script appears to be a standard utility for package information display.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It only outputs static package information based on command-line input, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
