  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code against the claims, and assess the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version details.\n- It reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) and writes to `sys.stdout`.\n- No external data, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated/malicious code patterns.\n- The functions are straightforward, static string outputs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n**1. Are the reported issues present?**  \n- All reports correctly identify that the script only outputs static information based on command-line input.  \n- No malicious behavior, no data leaks, no external dependencies involved.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in describing the code as benign, static, and straightforward.  \n- No logical errors or misinterpretations detected.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue?**  \n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0.0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0.0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0.0  \n- These are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n- No issues with high risk scores; all are correctly low (0.0).  \n- The code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**  \n- The malware score is 0.0 across all reports, aligning with the code's benign nature.\n\n**6. Assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n- All reports correctly dismiss any assumptions of vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the code?**  \n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Additional critical assessment:\n\n- The code is purely informational, static, and has no suspicious patterns.\n- No obfuscation, no dynamic code, no external dependencies.\n- The purpose is to provide CLI info about a package, which is typical and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the code:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0.0** | **0.0** | **0.0** |\n\nThese match the reports' assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.**\n- **All reports correctly identify the absence of security risks.**\n- **Scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.**\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nNo changes needed; the reports are accurate and well-justified. The overall security posture of this script is very high—no malware, obfuscation, or security risk detected.",
