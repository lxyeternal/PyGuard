{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a CLI entry point for a package, providing version and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments from sys.argv and writing output to sys.stdout.",
  "targets": "Potentially, the command-line argument '--version' triggers the printing of version info.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is present in sys.argv, the script calls print_version(), which writes version info to stdout; otherwise, print_info() is called, which writes package details to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code is straightforward and only outputs static information.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys to access command-line arguments and output streams. It defines two functions to print package info and version, both using static strings. The main() function checks for '--version' argument and responds accordingly, then calls print_info() if no argument matches. The script is simple, lacks dynamic code execution, and does not interact with external systems or data sources. No suspicious or malicious activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a CLI info display tool, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data flow. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
