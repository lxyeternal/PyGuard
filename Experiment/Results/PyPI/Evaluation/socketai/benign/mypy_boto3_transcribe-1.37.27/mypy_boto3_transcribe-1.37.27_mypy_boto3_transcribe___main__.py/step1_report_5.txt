{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface entrypoint to display package information or version details for a Python package related to boto3 TranscribeService stubs.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs package info or version to stdout)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs data to stdout), no untrusted data sources or external sinks involved",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (source: sys.argv) to conditional output functions (print_version or print_info), which write static data to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The script is straightforward, with static strings and simple conditional logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys for handling command-line arguments and standard output. It defines two functions, print_info and print_version, which output static package information and version. The main() function checks for the '--version' argument and calls the corresponding function; otherwise, it displays package info. The script is designed for CLI interaction and contains only static, hardcoded output data. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. The structure is typical for CLI scripts and does not contain malicious logic or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package metadata and version information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious data flow, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, straightforward script intended for informational purposes.",
